    <Title>Vote of Confidence&mdash;Motion by Taoiseach (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government.&rdquo;&mdash;(The Taoiseach).</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Adjournment last night I referred to a number of speeches made by the Taoiseach during the course of the 1948 General Election in which he referred to the weak position of the then Government, they having lost two out of three by-elections, and said that, although they had a majority of 12 or 14 over all Parties, it was not sufficient to have a majority in the Parliament but that they must have a majority in the country as well.  It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the arguments advanced here in favour of this motion when contrasted with the <Col N="150" /> speeches made during that general election.</P>
      <P>Since last November there have been three by-elections and in each of the three the Fianna Fáil Party sustained a defeat.  That shows that the electorate who were consulted, and who had an opportunity of expressing their views on the economic policy enshrined in the Budget of last year after it took effect, emphatically repudiated and rejected that policy.  It shows further that if the Government's position was weak when they lost two out of three by-elections it must be still weaker when they lost as they did in the recent by-elections, two out of two, when they failed to secure even one of the two contested seats, and the Taoiseach himself admitted during the course of the recent by-elections that their position would be weakened if they did not win those by-elections.  It is quite obvious from the results of these two by-elections that the Government have no mandate to continue in office.</P>
      <P>This motion is a device to secure, if possible, a parliamentary majority in order to give a cloak of support to a Government who have already forfeited the confidence of the electorate. It is not a confidence motion, it is a confidence trick.  The Government are attempting to cling on to office, to buy time at public expense, in order to continue in office and to give some extra time to those who require it.  They are clinging to office against the expressed wishes of the electorate, where the electorate were afforded an opportunity of casting their votes.</P>
      <P>It is significant that in the recent campaign every effort that the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party were capable of making was put into the campaign.  Ministers, Deputies and Senators were all present in the two constituencies.  A maximum effort was made to stir up enthusiasm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever was lacking in the case of other Ministers, determined efforts were made to get big meetings, to bring in supporters, to manufacture enthusiasm, at meetings for the Taoiseach, and it was quite obvious to those people in the constituencies, to those people who were local to the particular towns concerned, that in <Col N="151" /> most cases the people attending the meetings were imported.  The number of cars with registration numbers other than the county in which they were then present was itself evidence of the huge effort, of the extraordinary activity, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to stimulate enthusiasm and generate public interest in the policy of the present Government.  The result shows that although Fianna Fáil confidently expected to win Cork, confidently expected to secure one out of two seats, to be able to say that the <i>status quo</i> had been maintained&mdash;that they only had one of the seats before the election and that they still had one&mdash;and it would be possible to explain away Wicklow on the grounds that a dispute had occurred on account of what was regarded as outside interference at a Fianna Fáil Convention&mdash; that the people were not deceived. The flag-waving and the bands and the efforts, the expenditure of time, money and energy failed to stimulate enthusiasm and failed to stimulate votes when the ballot boxes were opened.</P>
    <P>During this debate, when the Taoiseach introduced the motion, I think he did not refer once to the by-elections. He dwelt on past difficulties, he dwelt on various events between 1932 and 1953 but he did not mention the by-elections, and when I heard him refer to the 38th Parallel I knew there was no hope of any reference to the by-elections in the course of his speech.  The people know that this motion is a device.  They know it cannot change the will of the people, as expressed in the ballot boxes.  They are not deceived by it, and if it achieves the purpose for which it is designed&mdash;to buy time at public expense &mdash;it will not obscure the facts that this Government are clinging on like limpets to place and power and profit; that they are clinging on to office against the expressed wishes of the people.  Some people may inquire and members of the Government find it difficult to understand why constituencies in which they could confidently in the past seek and secure a <Col N="152" /> majority of the votes of those concerned have changed; but the public remember that in 1951, this time two years ago, a 17-point programme was published by the Fianna Fáil Party after the election; that in that programme, there was point 15.  It dealt with the Fianna Fáil policy on food subsidies and price control, and that point guaranteed in that published programme which was prepared after the election, when the Government was seeking the necessary extra votes to give them a majority, to continue, not merely food subsidies, but to operate and regulate an efficient system of price control.  The public are familiar with, and Deputies remember, how when there had been a rise towards the end of 1950 and in the early months of 1951 in the cost of some commodities&mdash;a rise of only 2d. in the price of butter in April 1951&mdash; that Fianna Fáil platforms were loud in their denunciations, loud in their anger and loud in their sympathy with the people in the burdens that had been placed upon them.  The people expected, and it was reasonable to assume, that having published their programme&mdash;not only was it not published during the election but it was probably unique in political experience to publish a programme after an election&mdash;that the subsidies would be continued at the existing rate.</P>
    <P>In less than 12 months after that Government had been elected, new taxation was imposed in the Budget of last year which was re-enacted and continued by the Budget of this year. The figures show that under the prices then existing in May, 1951, butter stood at 2/10 a lb., that in May, 1953, it had gone to 4/2; that the 2-lb. loaf had gone from 6½d. to 9¼d.; that flour had increased from 2/8 per stone to 4/9½d.; that sugar had increased from 4½d. to 7d. per lb.; that tea had increased from 2/8 to 5/- or 5/6 per lb.; that cigarettes had increased from 1/8 to 2/4 per packet of 20; that whiskey had increased from 3/- to 3/6 per glass; that stout had gone from 11d. to 1/3 per pint; porter from 8d. to 1/-; income-tax had increased by 1/- from 6/6 to 7/6; petrol from 3/2 to 3/6 a gallon.  That is not the whole story. Under indirect taxation which had <Col N="153" /> been criticised at the time by the then Opposition, added burdens were imposed by extra Post Office charges for telephone services, for ordinary letter services, for telegrams and for wireless licences.  At the same time added burdens had been imposed on motorists. A lorry owner plying his lorries for hire found the increases were as much in some cases as 50 per cent. and in others even higher.  Again, driving licences had been doubled from 10/- to £1.</P>
    <P>All these added burdens were placed upon the people who expected some relief, who expected&mdash;if they were to believe the published programme&mdash; some alleviation of the burdens, some lightening of the load they were obliged to carry.  As time went on and taxation increased, direct and indirect, to such an extent that on every platform, at every chamber of commerce and almost every company meeting, views were expressed that the burdens being borne by industry and the burdens being borne by trade and commerce had reached such dimensions that the Taoiseach himself was forced to admit that the country was staggering under them.</P>
    <P>When the Budget was introduced this year, the sections affected by these burdens, whether individual citizens in the case of some of the commodities that I have read out, or business or commerce hit by the staggering weight of taxation, found there was no relief for them.  In respect to industry, a promise was given that a committee or a commission would be established which would examine the incidence of taxation as it affected industry.  Anyone familiar with the work of these committees, and with the intricate problem involved in respect to incometax and surtax as applied to business, recognises that that will be a protracted investigation, that it will take time to lighten the burden, that, even if a recommendation is made that some alleviation should take place, such alleviation is not likely to occur this year and that the people concerned will be lucky if it occurs next year. When businessmen find themselves obliged to dispense with staffs and when builders find themselves obliged <Col N="154" /> to lay off workers, need the Government express concern, surprise or wonder that these difficulties have arisen?  Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office giving the numbers of unemployed in mid-April, 1953, as compared with mid-April, 1951, show that there have been some striking increases in unemployment.  In the building industry alone there are over 5,000 more people unemployed; agriculture lost 8,000, transport, 1,800, distributive trades, 1,500, food and drink, 1,300, clothing, 600, engineering, 700, mining and quarrying, 700.  In all, there were 22,000 more men and women in 25 industrial groups out of work in April last than in April, 1951.</P>
    <P>Recently a seasonal decline in the numbers unemployed has received comment from members of the Government who spoke on the matter.  They claimed credit that the situation had improved and expressed satisfaction that there had been a reduction, although the position still indicates that, despite what would be normally regarded as a period of the year in which peak employment is reached in a great many industries and a great many avocations, there are still 18,000 more persons on the unemployment register than was the case this time last year.  There are more people seeking work, more people obliged to sign on at the labour exchanges, more people obliged to seek work abroad that is denied to them at home.  At the same time, Ministers have claimed that stability is in sight so far as the cost of living is concerned.  Sometimes the claim, to use the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is &ldquo;that there is an appearance of stability&rdquo;.  Another time the claim is that &ldquo;stability has been reached&rdquo;. That claim was first made about three months ago.  Since then, that is since last February, there was a rise of three points in the official cost-of-living index figure and that does not include the various increases in respect to Post Office charges which had been put on before the additional burden of ½d. per lb. was placed on the retail price of sugar, nor does it include the extra 4d. in the lb. imposed in May on the price of cheese.  Is it still seriously suggested, having heard the melancholy <Col N="155" /> litany which I have read of the increases in prices of essential foodstuffs and of essential commodities needed by every household and by every individual, that stability has been reached?  If that is &ldquo;an appearance of stability&rdquo; then words have one meaning for the members of the Government and another meaning for the members of the ordinary community.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government have referred at length to the need for developing and expanding agriculture. I think it is universally recognised that the land reclamation scheme initiated during the term of office of the inter-Party Government was a good scheme and that it had in it prospects for the long-term development of our agricultural productivity.  The Government's approach to that problem has been to sell the machinery or to attempt to sell the machinery operated by the Department of Agriculture.  In respect to a great many private contractors who put their savings into the purchase of machinery they now find that work is no longer available.  They now find that long-term prospects for useful productive work have diminished. Farmers who are anxious to avail of the scheme and who recognise the great potentialities in it now find that the Department proposes to sell the machinery that is there.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which provided grants under which it was possible to drain the smaller rivers and streams to supplement the arterial drainage programme, substantial cuts have taken place.  The scheme now is a skeleton compared with the scheme that was in full production, geared up to a high pitch of endeavour and efficiency this time two years ago.  As if these two direct blows at long-term prospects of development were not sufficient, the latest proposals embodied in the circular issued to local authorities from the Department of Local Government in May of this year, will impose an added burden not only on farmers but on other ratepayers of every local authority throughout the <Col N="156" /> country.  Not satisfied with the increase in direct taxation, not content with the £11,000,000 extra imposed in last year's Budget, not content with cutting the food subsidies and increasing the indirect and direct burdens on all sections, the proposed economies of £3,500,000 which it is expected will be made by means of savings on this year's Book of Estimates, apparently include a saving of anything between £250,000 and £500,000, roughly £350,000, in respect of the relief of rates under the Agricultural Land (Relief of Rates) Act.</P>
    <P>The added burden on farmers and on ratepayers who have been already obliged this year to bear increases in rates, ranging from probably, in the lowest case, 1/6 in the £ to, as in the case of County Dublin, over 4/- in the £, imposes an intolerable weight of taxation on people already oppressed with the serious burden of the last two years that forced from the head of the present Government the admission that the country was staggering under the weight of taxation.</P>
    <P>I referred last night to the increases that had been granted to workers by their employers throughout the country.  A number of wage-adjustment agreements were made in order to offset the cost of living as it stood in autumn of last year but since then substantial increases have occurred for which there has been no commensurate adjustment by an increase in wages. In respect to public servants, civil servants, Gardaí, Army personnel, teachers and local authority officials, the increases which other sections of the community got as a result of the various negotiations that took place were delayed.  They were cheated out of three months' money to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>Bad as their conditions are and serious as are the burdens they have been forced to carry, no alleviation, no increase in respect of pensions has been granted to retired public authority officials.  Local authority officials, road workers, retired postmen, people who retired on comparatively modest pensions, pensions fixed on the basis of a now out-of-date cost-of-living <Col N="157" /> figure and on the basis of service rendered over a period of years when conditions were relatively stable, find that the retirement pension they are entitled to is in no way adequate to meet the increased cost of living, which falls just as heavily on them as on any other section of the community. The only consolation they got was the statement by the Minister for Finance that they had got the pensions that they were legally entitled to.  This Government may get a legal title to office; these people may get the pensions they are legally entitled to; but there is a moral consideration, the consideration of justice.  There is the ordinary consideration of fair play, of fair treatment and of what they are entitled to in Christian charity; but there has been no increase, no alleviation, no proposal to lighten their burdens.</P>
    <P>In the light of these circumstances, in the light of the results of the by-elections, the Government seek to cling on to office at a time when they have not got a majority of 12 or 14 over the other Parties.  The Taoiseach said in January, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If it can be suggested that a Government is not supported by the people, then a Government by that very fact is a weak Government&mdash;if after these elections, a finger can be pointed at us and it is said in the Dáil: &lsquo;You have a majority of 12 or 14 over the other Parties, the people are not behind you&rsquo;&mdash;you have not a majority of the people.  You know the Opposition would talk in that way and would be encouraged in their efforts by the fact that that charge could be made.  We are determined that that charge cannot be made and if we are to continue as a Government, we would have to have a majority in Parliament; be able to show that that majority was reasonably given to us and that the people were behind us as well as the majority in Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people are not deceived by this motion of confidence.  They recognise that it is a device.  They realise that the Government are buying time at the public expense, that they are endeavouring to give a few extra months, <Col N="158" /> or whatever extra time is required, to those who need it and are endeavouring to cling on to office in defiance of the expressed will of those electors who have had the opportunity of expressing their will.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in the light of the added burdens I have mentioned, the Government recently passed a Bill to postpone the local elections, to postpone giving the ratepayers, the farmers, those sections of the community who are bearing the burden and the heat of the day, an opportunity of expressing their view.  The Government seek to cling on to office and I think that even Fianna Fáil Deputies feel a sense of shame, if they have any shame left.  Yesterday we listened to the Taoiseach for three-quarters of an hour.  The pained expression on the face of the Tánaiste was surpassed only by the despair on the face of the Minister for Finance. It was obvious that these Ministers recognised that they had reached the end of the road, that the public are no longer deceived by the claptrap and the flag-waving.  Anybody who had the experience of attending meetings at the recent by-elections realises that the glamour has disappeared, that all the former glamour and enthusiasm, all the whipped-up energies it was possible to generate, can no longer obscure the clear facts of the situation, that the people have been obliged to bear added burdens arising out of various taxes and that people are struggling to live under the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is no argument to suggest, as the Minister for Lands suggested, that because there are new motor cars being taxed, the people are not badly off.  Everyone realises that in present circumstances a great number of people are obliged to have motor cars as their means of livelihood.  Apart from taximen, there are lorry owners, commercial travellers and people engaged in different occupations who must have motor cars as a means of transport and to suggest that the fact that new cars are being taxed, new vehicles being put on the road, is a sign of prosperity is a false argument. The large numbers registering at <Col N="159" /> the employment exchanges, the large numbers emigrating, of whom there are now no accurate statistics&mdash;no statistics of any kind&mdash;to seek work are ample evidence of the real situation. So great are the numbers leaving the country that at least three Bishops this year, on the occasions of their annual visit for Confirmation, have expressed alarm and concern because in the parishes they visit they find only old people and a few children, with the children getting fewer.  They see before the country bleak prospects, although they know the progress that could be made and they know the potentialities in our community.  They know that the natural resources not only of our soil but of our people, the ability our people have to work for themselves and the ability they have shown in other lands can be put to proper use at home if the necessary opportunity is given.</P>
    <P>During the short period of office of the inter-Party Government, employment increased substantially, industry expanded and houses were constructed. Only yesterday the Taoiseach referred to the recent housing figures and the figures for 1951.  Everybody knows that houses are not planned overnight, that houses are at present being constructed from plans made during the inter-Party Government's term of office.  The houses built by the inter-Party Government, or a great number of them, in 1948, were not planned by them but by the previous Administration.  The people who were employed on construction work&mdash;builders' labourers, skilled craftsmen, carpenters, bricklayers, masons&mdash;all these categories of workers who are now registering as unemployed and who have been forced to seek work abroad, see no signs of stability and no prospect of getting a livelihood in their own country, in their own cities, towns or localities.</P>
    <P>Published figures prove that not only is there no stability in the cost of living but that there has been a substantial rise and that the cost of living is going up and up.  The unemployment figures have reached alarming dimensions, and, for the first time since the war, we have unemployed parades of <Col N="160" /> persons seeking work.  That does not take into account the large numbers emigrating; that does not take into account the numbers that have been and still are on short-time or part-time.</P>
    <P>Faced with that situation, faced with the emphatic decision of the electors in North-West Dublin, in East Cork and in Wicklow, the Government seeks to cling on to office.  I do not think they have any shame because if they had they would face the people as we faced them and were prepared to accept and did accept the verdict of the electorate on our stewardship during the period in office of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>This motion is a parliamentary device to conceal the truth.  It is a motion designed to avoid contact with the electorate, designed to frustrate the expressed wishes of the people for the purpose of permitting the Government to cling on to office, to cling on to place and power for a few more months.  I do not believe that any self-respecting Government, any Government, the head of which was prepared to say in 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Government is strong only if it has a majority in Parliament, because with our system, the Government depends on the majority it has in Parliament.  It is a weak Government if it has not a strong majority . . . if, after these elections, a finger can be pointed at us, and it is said in the Dáil: &lsquo;You have a majority of 12 or 14 over the other Parties, but the people are not behind you&mdash; you have not the majority of the people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 20th January, 1948, speaking at Cahirciveen on 19th January.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are determined that that charge cannot be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it was possible to make that charge against a Government that had an overall majority how much stronger is the charge, how much greater emphasis, how much greater force is there behind the charge that the Government not only has not a majority but is seeking to cling on to office and <Col N="161" /> to defy the express wishes of the people, seeking to cling on to office for a few more months, or a few more days, maybe a few more hours in the vain hope that time may solve the problem, that conditions may improve and that circumstances may alter in their favour. That is the hope that Fianna Fáil offer to the community.</P>
    <P>No Government, no Party, no group of men with self-respect or with respect for the opinion of the electorate would cling on in that disedifying fashion.  It is a disedifying spectacle to see this Government, a Government that has been 18 years out of the last 21 in office here, clinging on for a few extra months.  It is no wonder that yesterday, so gloomy did the prospect appear, that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance buried their faces in their hands and back benchers felt obliged to leave in contrast with the circumstances in which every Fianna Fáil seat would be filled and every available vote would be in to hear the Taoiseach.  Yesterday those who came in felt humiliated that the Government was seeking to cling on to office, to defy the express wishes of the people and to get a few extra days or a few extra hours.</P>
    <P>We have said before, and we believe, that the Government has no mandate or authority for the policy they are operating.  They have no mandate from the people for the burdens they have imposed upon them.  They have no authority to continue to operate the policy in relation to which they have long since forfeited the confidence of the people.  The present uncertain position due to lack of confidence in the Government is bad for business. It is bad for trade.  It is bad for the people.  It is bad for the nation and the country as a whole.  How could anybody in any walk of life deal confidently with the present Government?</P>
    <P>The Government may be legally in office but they have not the moral authority or the force of public opinion behind them.  They have not the confidence of the people, a confidence that any self-respecting Government and any Government that claims to represent the people and to work for them must have if it is to continue effectively <Col N="162" /> to operate a proper policy on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>We do not lightly seek the burdens of office, but our duty to the people must take precedence over personal considerations.  The paramount consideration in present circumstances is that expression should be given to the will of the people.  The people should be consulted.  If the people are consulted, whatever their verdict is we will accept it as we accepted it before. The people are entitled to be consulted. This device, this trick, this motion, this waste of public time and public expense, this discussion which should properly be conducted at the cross-roads and not in Parliament is not a substitute for an election which the people confidently hope and firmly believe cannot be long delayed.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear Deputy Cosgrave and his Leader, Deputy J. A. Costello, sneering at what they call a mere parliamentary majority.  According to their speeches yesterday and to-day a Government has no authority to carry on if it can only prove that it has a mere parliamentary majority.  According to these speeches a Government must be able to prove any day it is challenged that it has not only a parliamentary majority but also a majority of the popular vote.  They did not use to, as the Americans say; they used not to have that outlook in relation to a parliamentary majority.  Time was when they were forming a Government here when a parliamentary majority could do anything irrespective of the wishes of the people and, indeed, from day to day the parliamentary majority that the Government might secure might be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old Cumann na nGaedheal Government took some strange decisions on a parliamentary majority representing a minority, a very small minority, of the people elected here to Parliament and of the popular will.  If the new theory put forward by Fine Gael is that a Government cannot govern even for one day unless it can prove that it has the support of the majority of the electorate, if that is to become the law <Col N="163" /> or a part of our Constitution, a Constitution by which all Governments must abide, then the sooner we change the Constitution the better.  According to the Constitution the elected Government can carry on unless it fails to retain the confidence of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Of course, Fine Gael fought the Constitution very strenuously when it was being put to the people.  They have come to accept other portions of the Constitution and even though they now speak against the particular clause which governs the changes of Government, perhaps, they will come round to accepting that particular clause too.  The Constitution does not say that when a Government is elected it is to retain office until it is defeated in a by-election or in two or three by-elections.  The Constitution says that as long as the Government retains the confidence of the Dáil it is legally, constitutionally and in every other way entitled to carry on and act as a Government.</P>
    <P>If in the old days, when Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal was in power with the help of various groups, they had argued then that because the Government was defeated at a by-election it should get out, we would have had a hundred times more changes of Government than we have had.  During the period of Fine Gael, from 1922 to 1932, I remember occasions upon which they were very heavily defeated.  They were defeated by a three or four to one majority in Dublin, when Deputy Lemass was first elected in 1924.  I remember an occasion when in Longford-Westmeath they were very heavily defeated again and another time in Kildare, but they carried on the Government because they maintained they had the Constitution with them and that a Government was elected to remain in office for five years if it continued to hold the support of the majority of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>If we are to have the other system, that a Government carries on not from general election to general election, with the support of the Dáil, but from general election to the first by-election in which it is defeated, we will have a completely different Constitution from that which we have.  If <Col N="164" /> we are to have the new theory put forward by Fine Gael that a Government must prove it has the popular will behind it before it can become a Government or carry on, we will have to take steps to get some authority to adjudicate upon the question as to whether, in fact, a Government does have the support of the majority of the electorate.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the Government which was elected on the 18th February, 1948.  It claimed that it had the will of the majority of the electorate. That was inferred by Deputy Costello and Deputy Cosgrave yesterday. They claimed that they had the right to carry on even though they had a Party associated with them like the Clann na Talmhan Party which, during the election, definitely swore from every platform that never would they touch a Coalition.  Deputy Blowick talked all over Mayo and the West and on every platform he used the same sort of expressive language to show his disgust for the idea of a Coalition.</P>

      <P>He spoke about the bad odour that had been left by the previous Farmers' Parties who had coalesced with Fine Gael and he swore that never again would Clann na Talmhan or the group that Deputy Blowick represented join with Fine Gael.  Can it be said that a Party that pledged itself in that way to the people and that asked the people's support for that policy represented portion of the popular majority for the Coalition?  Of course it is nonsense.</P>
      <P>The thesis that Deputy Costello adumbrates in the Dáil that Fianna Fáil should get out unless they can prove they have an absolute majority of the people for their single Party is completely at variance with the action of Deputy Costello in accepting Government and carrying on for three years even though the Fine Gael Party had not a majority of the people. Indeed, it was a very small minority of the total electorate and he was quite prepared to carry on as long as he had a parliamentary majority which he sneers at to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> It is true to say that a Government which has both a parliamentary majority and a majority of the popular vote is a much stronger Government and a much more effective Government than one that has not both majorities. I think it would have been a good thing for the country in 1948 if it had given Fianna Fáil a majority and again in 1951 I think it would have been a good thing for the country if they had given the Fianna Fáil Party a majority of representatives in the House and a majority of the popular vote.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that seldom in history has it happened that a Government gets a majority of the popular vote in any country.  I remember once looking up the various elections by which President Roosevelt was elected and only once had he a majority of the popular vote.  He got the highest number of votes of any presidential candidate but when you add up the popular votes cast for his Republican, Communist and other opponents about whom we hardly ever hear anything in this country&mdash;there are always three or four presidential candidates in the United States, but we only hear about the Republican or the Democratic candidate&mdash;in only one case did he get a majority.  In my recollection, for as long as I have taken an interest in politics, it was only once or twice that any Government got a majority of the popular vote in England.  Although Fianna Fáil had many times a reasonable majority in the House, I doubt whether we ever had a majority of the popular vote.  It may have happened on one occasion though I am not too sure of that.</P>
    <P>If the theory is going to be accepted that a Government cannot be elected and cannot carry on unless it has a majority of the popular vote, and if that is to become the practice, how are we going to form a Government?  It seems to me that Deputy Costello's theory is unworkable, and that it was merely put forward on this occasion in order to deceive the people.  The fact is that his Government, or the Government which he ran here for three years, had not only not got a majority of the popular vote but his own particular Party was a very small minority <Col N="166" /> of the popular vote.  In 1948, Fine Gael got 262,000 votes out of a total vote cast of 1,300,000, less than one-fifth of the total vote, yet Deputy Costello thought that he had not only the constitutional but the moral and legal authority to form a Government to carry on here for three years.  Even though he represented a minority of the country of less than one-fifth, he carried on the Government here with the help in Parliament of people who had sworn that they would never join him, and who had no mandate from the people to join him but rather a definite instruction to the contrary.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that in May, 1951, Fianna Fáil did not get a majority of the popular vote in the country, but we got twice as many popular votes as Fine Gael.  We got 616,000 as against the 300,000 odd which they polled.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Constitution in so far as they relate to the life of Parliament and the time at which general elections would be held are, I think, reasonable.  The Constitution recognises that if a Government is to carry out a programme it must have a reasonable time to put its policy into effect.  In the case of our Constitution, it allows the Dáil, by law, to give Parliament a life of seven years.  Our law gives Parliament the right to carry on for five years.  When we had the last general election, the various Parties were asking the people to give them the right to carry on Government for five years.  On the occasion that we became the Government, it was clearly pointed out to the country and to the Dáil that this Government proposed to carry on the policy of Fianna Fáil, the policy which it had advocated and had acted upon for many years&mdash;for 20 or 25 years&mdash; and that we proposed to carry it on as long as we got a majority in the House to support us.</P>
    <P>That was our position in June, 1951, and it is our position to-day.  In recent weeks, during the by-elections or immediately after them, it was alleged that we had no longer a parliamentary majority in Parliament.  This motion is put down to test that.  Everybody has got long notice of it.  It was not <Col N="167" /> thrown in at a day's or two days' notice.  We gave notice of it more than a week before it was due to be debated in the Dáil, and almost a fortnight before the vote on it was due to take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke about the attitude of Fianna Fáil during the general election of 1948 and during the previous by-elections in 1947.  It is true to say that it had been announced officially by Fianna Fáil&mdash;by the Government &mdash;that if we were badly defeated in the by-elections of 1947 we could not carry on as a Government. It is also true to say that, in the following general election, we appealed to the people for an absolute majority in order that we could carry on.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Costello blamed us for having caused a great number of elections between 1932 and 1948, but in the same breath he denounced us for not having a general election now.  On certain occasions, when we were previously in Government from 1932 to 1948, it was absolutely essential that we should from time to time prove that we had in this House a secure and absolute majority of Fianna Fáil members.  It was necessary on occasions to have general elections in order to prove that we had the right to carry on here as a Government.</P>
    <P>In 1947, after the Supplementary Budget, we lost two of the three by-elections very heavily, and it was because we had lost them to a Party that had not been represented in this House, a Party that claimed that not only had it a majority over Fianna Fáil but that it had a majority against all Parties in the House&mdash;that is the Clann na Poblachta Party&mdash;that it was necessary to go to the people to see whether the case that was put forward by the Clann na Poblachta Party was in fact true or not.  We had the general election in February, 1948.  In order to carry on the illusion which they had hoped to create, the Clann na Poblachta Party put up candidates in the majority of the constituencies, and their propaganda was &ldquo;give MacBride the reins of Government&rdquo;. They put up enough candidates to give <Col N="168" /> them the reins of Government as a single Party.  If there had not been a general election in 1948, undoubtedly that Party would have continued to rant round the country pointing to the result of the by-elections as showing how they had secured a majority in the constituencies that had been contested. They said if the total number of seats in the country were contested they would have a majority and claimed we had no right to govern here.  They in that particular group were prone to use tactics that can be used by various groups outside in order to upset the Government; but it was necessary in 1948 to clear the air and the air was cleared.</P>
    <P>When the election results were declared and the votes were totted up in 1948 it was proved that we had by far the greatest number of votes among the people and that we secured by far the greatest number of seats in the Dáil.  However, the fact that we had a far bigger percentage of votes than any other Party did not prevent Deputy Costello, with less than one-fifth of the votes and about one-fifth of the seats, organising a Coalition in defiance of the popular will.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to remember that Deputy Costello at that time not only maintained that he had the moral, legal and constitutional right to form the Government, even though his Party did not get one-fifth of the votes or one-fifth of the seats, but he claimed once he formed a Government that a mere defeat in the Dáil now and then was not going to change the Government. He was going to form the Government notwithstanding the small percentage of the votes and seats which he secured; and even if he were defeated in the Dáil from time to time he told us he would carry on, and, as we know, he did in fact carry on. After he had been defeated in the Dáil on a Post Office Estimate he came back the next day with a motion of confidence which represented more or less the same tactics as the Fine Gael Government used in 1931 and 1932. When they were defeated on an Old Age Pensions Bill they came back the next day with a motion of confidence.</P>
    <P>I want again to remind the Fine Gael <Col N="169" /> Deputies of the actions they justified by what they now sneer at as mere parliamentary majorities and to look at the Dáil debates for the 15th December, 1925, and the 8th December, 1922, just to think of what they were able to justify by mere parliamentary majorities.  We know, too, that in the time of the Coalition their method of getting out of the difficulty of having a majority for a particular measure was to leave it to a free vote, but as far as we are concerned there is no free vote about this vote of confidence. Those who want us to pursue for the next three years the policy of development which we announced will vote for us.  If they do not want us they should vote against us.</P>
    <P>The central theme of Deputy Costello's denunciation of Fianna Fáil is that they have overtaxed the people to the extent of creating total misery; that we had instituted a régime of frightfulness, that we caused unnecessary pain and suffering and human misery.  There were many more denunciations of that type.  The easiest thing in the world for a Government to make is money.  If we thought it the right thing to do we could have arranged in our Budgets in 1947, in 1952 or in 1953, instead of increasing taxation, to reduce it.  We could have reduced taxation by 25 per cent., by 50 per cent. or by 100 per cent.  To-morrow, if we thought it were the right thing to do, we could completely abolish all taxation in this country and substitute a system whereby funds would come into the possession of the Government which they would use for Government expenses.  If we did not want to go the whole hog we could go part of the way, reduce part of the taxation, something we thought would be popular, and raise the balance of the funds in one of the various ways in which a Government can do it if they do not want to tax.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Coalition Government in an inflationary situation reduced taxation and changed over from meeting its current expenses out of its current annual normal income through taxation was a step back to mediævalism rather than a step forward to modern finance.  It was a step <Col N="170" /> back to the time when the kings clipped the coins and issued something of less value.  It was a step back to Woods ha'pence.</P>
    <P>It is right that a Government at any time should ensure that the people will have enough money to enable their full activities to be engaged in, to enable their full human and material resources to be used to increase their standard of life.  But it is wrong that a Government should have more than that amount of money in circulation and it is disastrous for a country when a Government comes into office and, through fear of unpopularity or through threats of some of the minority groups associated with it, takes the step of deliberately inflating the volume of money in the country beyond that which is the right and proper amount to enable the full resources and energy of the country to be utilised.</P>
    <P>That is what the Coalition Government did in 1949.  In 1948, when they came in, they threatened and, indeed, carried out a régime of retrenchment. Deputy McGilligan, in his first Budget speech in 1948, said that wages and salaries were as high at that time as the country could afford and social justice demanded.  Deputy Costello shortly afterwards made a speech in which he talked about the alarm with which he viewed the state of our balance of payments.  In Volume 112, column 2146, Official Debates, he said that the adverse trade balance had gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thought about it for one moment or who looked at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.  Further on, he said that it gave them the greatest possible cause for dismay and he said that steps must urgently be taken to redress that adverse balance of trade and to try to restore order into our disordered balance of payments.</P>
    <P>What disorder in the balance of payments was he talking about?  From 1939 to 1946 we had built up, in spite of ourselves, what is called a favourable balance of trade&mdash;£140,000,000 in those years.  In 1945 it was a favourable balance of £33.5 million and in 1946 it was still favourable to the extent of £20,000,000.  But, from 1939 to 1946 the <Col N="171" /> total favourable balance of trade built up by investments abroad was £140,000,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello spoke about the utmost alarm in regard to our balance of payments, the greatest possible cause for dismay because that £140,000,000 plus the other investments we had before the war had been reduced in 1947 by a mere £20,000,000 and in 1948 they were falling&mdash;he did not know the exact figure&mdash;at the rate of a mere £20,000,000.  So that he had alarm and despondency even though in the previous few years we had built up £140,000,000 of investments outside, added to our resources to the tune of £140,000,000 but, because that £140,000,000 plus the other £100,000,000 &mdash;whatever we had&mdash;had been reduced by £20,000,000 and was threatened to be reduced by another £20,000,000 in the year in which he was speaking, he was filled, as he said, with the utmost alarm and with the greatest dismay.  I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>I wanted to point out that Deputy McGilligan came in here and announced a Government of retrenchment. Deputy Costello came along in the middle of 1948 and spoke also as a man of extreme orthodoxy in questions of finance.  Why did they change from that, from the point of cutting down things like mineral development, cutting out things like the chassis factory, postponing for three years the extension of cement works&mdash;why did they suddenly change from being a Government of retrenchment and financial orthodoxy of the antediluvian type of Cumann na nGaedheal up to 1932? Why did they suddenly change to explosive inflationists?  Simply because they found that it suited their political book to do so.  It was not progress that was in their minds; it was carrying on as a Government here.</P>
    <P>They did not institute anything new when they embarked upon inflationary finance, when they borrowed all sorts of moneys in times when prices were rising, when inflation was around, and added to the inflation.  They did it, not for good motives of modern finance but for bad motives of weak politicians who were prepared to postpone or pass <Col N="172" /> on the difficulties, which they should face in the interests of the people, to those that came after them and they passed them on in great style.</P>
    <P>From 1921-1932 the service of debt was £2,500,000 When we came into office, after the first ten years or so, the accumulation of national debt cost the taxpayers £2,500,000.  In 1947-48, when we left office, after a total of 16 years, the service of debt had not doubled, it had only gone to £4,820,000 and those 16 years' debt had been increased by us to the extent of £10,000,000 to make a final settlement with the British.  Ten million pounds of the increase in the debt went for that.  By 1951 when the previous Government left office the service of debt had gone up to £7,247,000.  It took 30 years for the service of debt to grow to £4,800,000 but in three years of the Coalition it almost doubled.  They had added as much in three years as had been added to the national debt for 30 years before.  I am talking now about the dead-weight debt, not about the debt which is for the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna or things of that kind; and the figures I gave relate to the amount of money which the taxpayer has to pay for the service of debt in addition to what the Exchequer gets from Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., or any other organisation or the local authorities to which the Exchequer has lent money.  In three years the Coalition Government doubled the amount of money which the people had to pay for the service of debt.  It meant that they had spent sums collected by way of loans to an extent that far exceeded the correct amount.  They added to the public debt instead of meeting their liabilities.  If it was necessary to add to the public debt in time of deflation I would be altogether in favour of it, but merely to get out of political difficulties in an inflationary period by adding to the public debt is not only bad finance but it is treachery to the people, the worst form of treachery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion it is treachery to the people to endeavour to persuade them that you are doing them a good turn by relieving them of taxation at the price of inflation.  Inflation is the worst form of taxation. When a Government increases taxation it can pick out the backs upon which it will impose the burden and has to justify to the people, to the electorate, as a whole, the putting of the extra burden on the income-tax payer as against the cigarette buyer, on the person who goes to the cinema rather than the person who drinks beer and so on.  A Government has to take responsibility when it imposes taxation to extend or maintain the service of Government; but if to avoid the political unpopularity of raising hostility among the income-tax payers or the cigarette smokers or the beer drinkers it deliberately inflates the currency of the country it is acting, in my opinion, in the most treacherous way, because inflation clips a bit off everybody's sixpence, everybody's penny, as well as everybody's pound or thousand pounds. Inflation is a watering of the currency; if it is done in a time when there is too much money floating around it reacts disastrously upon the price level in the country or on its balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There used to be during the Coalition's period an argument used by them that because their inflationary finance did not create a more spectacular effect on the price level, as it did in other countries, that in fact their borrowing to meet all sorts of current expenses was not in fact inflationary. There are two recognisable <Col N="174" /> attributes of inflation in the modern world.  One is in a closed economy when, if you pour out more money than there are goods to meet, the tendency is for the price of goods to go up.  The other is where there is a rather open economy such as ours, where 80 per cent. of the goods are free to flow in without any taxation or stop.  In this case the most immediate sign of inflationary finance is a large increase in the deficit of payments and that is what happened during the Coalition's régime.</P>
    <P>The inflationary finance imposed upon us an additional cost of our dead-weight debt and caused a large deficit in our balance of payments.  So large was the deficit in our balance of payments that in a couple of years the Coalition had almost exhausted half our net reserves.  Deputy Costello had been very concerned, as he pointed out, because in the last year of Fianna Fáil the £140,000,000 which we had built up, which the country had built up, in reserves had been reduced by £20,000,000 or so; but by the end of 1951 he was boasting that our reserves were disappearing at the rate of £60,000,000 a year, and the reason they were disappearing at £60,000,000 a year in 1948, 1949 and 1950 was because the Government was deliberately inflating the currency of the country by borrowing when it should have taxed in an inflationary situation.  They were, of course, helped to carry on that type of policy because of the coming of the Marshall Aid loans.</P>
    <P>In order to get sterling into the Loan Counterpart Fund which could be borrowed in addition to borrowing from ordinary Government Funds, general instructions must have gone out to spending Departments of Government to spend as hard as they could. Deputy Dillon boasted that he had spent £5,000,000 inside an afternoon, that his only difficulty was to find things upon which to spend dollars. They spent the dollars, £46,000,000 worth of dollars, about $140,000,000, buying in maize and other commodities which we could very well have produced and should have been endeavouring, at any rate, to produce in increasing quantities here at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> We will have to pay back, and we have started to pay, that Marshall Aid loan.  It is going to take us 40 years to do it and we have to pay it back in dollars.  Last year we made a beginning. This year another amount is going back and our people will have to pay in dollars for the next 40 years moneys that were borrowed from America and spent in bringing in wheat, maize, nylons and everything else during the three years of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>The result of the inflationary finance in an inflationary period of the Coalition Government was an increase from £4,800,000 in the service of dead-weight debt to £7,247,000&mdash;moneys which will have to be met out of taxation year by year by our people.  If we had not to pay that, if the Coalition had not increased dead-weight debt to that extent during those years, we could have less taxation this year. In addition to that, we have to pay back the American loan, dollars which were so badly misspent by the Coalition.  We have also to carry on with less external reserves than we should have in order to build up our country for the future.</P>
    <P>There was a ridiculous campaign by some members of the Coalition about our external reserves, when it came to the point that they wanted to spend them to avoid internal political difficulty. When they reached that period, they sneered night, noon and morning at the level of external reserves and resolved that they were going to end this &ldquo;national disgrace&rdquo; of having reserves abroad.  Deputy MacBride a couple of years ago advocated even that we should spend every penny of what the Coalition left, that we should buy wool, tin, copper and other things. Had we followed his advice and invested the external reserves that the Coalition left behind them unspent, we would have got rid of our external reserves and, if spent on wool, we would have lost two-thirds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>How much has the Government lost in the last 12 months on the fall in values?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have paid three times the price for wool that <Col N="176" /> we could sell it for now.  If we had bought copper it would have fallen in value also and if we had bought a lot of other things they also would have fallen.  Deputy Costello joined Deputy MacBride in talking of the &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; of having external assets, when the effect of his inflationary finance was to liquidate our external assets.  It is not generally realised&mdash;and certainly was not by certain members of the Coalition when they started&mdash;that a Government does not and cannot of its own direct action or single action take back external assets.  Their liquidation or withdrawal is largely the result of the general economic activities of the people.</P>
      <P>If a Government has, as our Government has, £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 invested in British Funds on behalf of some of the public funds, and if the Government sells out those funds in order to invest in Irish loans or give them to the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna, the initial effect is to swell the funds of the Central Bank or the ordinary commercial banks.  The cheques that it gets in London for the sale of its British securities and lodge in the ordinary way with the Government bankers here, result in sterling being transferred and that banker is left with a sterling asset equivalent to the Irish funds he gives to the Government or pays out on its behalf.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if the law were to be changed to-morrow and the Central Bank could invest, say, £50,000,000 in the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and a few other things, and sold out its British securities in London and brought back the funds here and gave them through the banks to those organisations, the effect of that would be simply to change the holding, the ownership of external assets, from the Central Bank to the ordinary banks.  The fact of the matter is, that we cannot liquidate or take back external reserves unless we take them back in the form of goods or services.  If we do not do that, if we do not have an adverse balance in our payments, the result of one organisation or individual selling out foreign assets and taking them back here is to increase the external holdings of some other organisation, banking or private, within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> There is no one in Fianna Fáil who has any objection, or ever had any objection, to an economic use of the past savings of our people, whether they were located here in this country or invested abroad.  We believe, however, that it is necessary, if our children and our children's children are to prosper, that we should have a certain amount of reserves which will help us through in case of necessity or enable us to develop some project which we urgently need to develop.</P>
    <P>There is the question of national prestige as well as the question of financial necessity.  It is an ugly thing for a country to be kicked around by its creditors.  At the moment, we still have left £100,000,000 of net external reserves and we can, therefore, call our souls our own.  If we want to buy some machinery for the extension of our electricity supply we do not have to go abroad to look for a loan to enable us to buy the machinery.  We have our external assets which we can exchange for capital equipment.  To the extent that we have certain loans outstanding abroad due to strangers&mdash;whether individuals or organisations&mdash;investing in our national loans, when our national loans come for repayment we can pay them off with our external reserves. We are different from that very prosperous little nation now&mdash;New Zealand &mdash;as she was, say, in 1938.  I remember distinctly that in 1938 the New Zealand Government had to face the repayment of a loan that was falling-in in London: the amount was £30,000,000.  Representatives of the New Zealand Government went to the appropriate authorities in London and asked for support but they were told: &ldquo;No.  Go and balance your Budget&rdquo;.  They went back to New Zealand not knowing how they were going to meet the repayment of the £30,000,000 which was falling-in in London.  When they went to the British authorities they got no support but were given a lecture on sound finance and told to go home. Only when the war clouds came on the horizon were they summoned from New Zealand and given £30,000,000. We do not want our people put into <Col N="178" /> that position so that, if a loan is falling-in, we will have to go on our knees to somebody.  We want to have a reasonable reserve abroad with which to meet our commitments.  We want to have such reserves abroad as will enable us to run our economy in a fairly elastic way.</P>
    <P>If Fine Gael had continued for another couple of years they and the rest of the Coalition would have run us out of our net foreign assets. If somebody wanted to buy a machine, even from Britain, we should have to look at the accounts and say: &ldquo;We have not got the £5,000.  You will have to wait six months until we earn that amount&rdquo;.  That has happened. Just take a look at the assets of other countries and consider the meas and esteem they put on them.  Take, for instance, Britain's external assets. Britain has been described as a rather rich country with developed resources and great skill.  Because her external assets dropped to about five hundred or six hundred million dollars a couple of years ago she upset the whole trade of Europe, and a great part of that of the world, in order to conserve what was left.  In one fell swoop, Britain's imports from the Continent were cut by about £350,000,000, and that, in its turn, put half of the Continent into great financial and economic trouble. The British refused to buy from them and the British rightly said: &ldquo;We cannot buy.  If we do not save the £500,000,000 or £600,000,000 left, we will soon be in the position that we shall have nothing in the kitty.  We have got to have a certain reserve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We believe that we here should have a certain amount of external reserves in order to carry on our daily life in the confidence that the bills normally falling due can be paid and that we do not have to crib, cabin and confine every person engaged in business saying: &ldquo;You cannot carry out that business even in England, Scotland or elsewhere in the E.P.U. area unless. first of all, you get a permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the past couple of years we have been in the E.P.U. area and we have been able to carry <Col N="179" /> on business with all parts of the world outside the dollar area without any exchange control and without prior authorisation from the Department of Finance.  But, if the Coalition Government had continued for a further two years and had spent our sterling assets and left us with no sterling reserve, we should have had to have the same system in regard to sterling authorisations for spending as we have had, and must continue to have for some time longer, in regard to dollar expenditure. If anybody wants to know the effects on any country of being bereft of sterling or foreign reserves just let him think of what he has to do if he wants to get a few dollars to enable him to take either himself or his family to America for a few weeks or longer or if he wants to buy some American machine or even to send a subscription to an American newspaper.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government&mdash;at least a number of them&mdash;fundamentally knew as much about the necessity for a country to have external assets, if it is to progress, as Fianna Fáil did or as the British Government or any other Government did.  If it is to have an elastic economy and some reasonable liberty in the financial field, then it must have external assets with which to meet its liabilities.  The reason the Coalition Government went on a spending spree during an inflationary period was to avoid political difficulties, thus passing on to the future the difficulties that they should have met and surmounted themselves.</P>
    <P>In Volume 124 of the Official Report, column 1620, it will be seen that Deputy McGilligan admitted to me that if all the borrowing he engaged in did not result in a large increase of output then the borrowing would be a bit of a headache, as he put it, for a future Minister for Finance.  Let us examine, therefore, the extraordinary expenditure incurred by our predecessors, taking into account the effect of that expenditure on increasing production. The moneys that were spent had the result of adding about £4,000,000 to our annual payment for dead-weight debt, left us with a burden of repayment of about £140,000,000 <Col N="180" /> dollars and decreased our external assets by well over £100,000,000.  What was there on the other side?  On the other side was a decrease in agriculture. There was some slight increase in industrial production, but there was a decrease in agricultural production. Tillage was cut down by over 500,000 acres.  Therefore, in the total account, they left us with an increase in the dead-weight debt, a huge American debt, a decrease in our external assets, and no corresponding increase in production.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years we have tried to correct a trend in agricultural production that was becoming a habit with a number of farmers.  We had to increase the price of beet and the price of wheat.  I am glad to say that this year our wheat acreage will be up by 100,000 acres or so and, if all goes well, it looks as if we will have a generous harvest.  Similarly, the increase in the price of beet has resulted in a very good increase in the acreage.  I think that the good work done by the sugar company in educating our farmers in the proper use of lime and fertilisers will result in yet another increase in the yield per acre this year.  Every year for the last couple of years the sugar company have reported an increase in the average yield of sugar beet per acre and this year I hope we will have a still further increase.</P>
    <P>One of the things I cannot understand about those who were interested in farming in the Coalition Government was that they allowed the Coalition Minister for Agriculture to act so viciously against the liming and fertilising of the land.  It was an absolutely vicious thing.  It was not that he did it in ignorance, because every year during the Coalition's term of office in many debates a number of Opposition Deputies and, indeed, a number of Deputies in the middle group and on the Fine Gael Benches advocated that we should have a real campaign to restore the calcium content of our soil, to put out the phosphates and the potash and the other things necessary to bring our agricultural output up.  It is a national disgrace for us that our net output from agriculture is as small as it is and little <Col N="181" /> more than it was 50 years ago.  We will not increase it until we restore the calcium content both of pastures and of tillage land.  The possibility of increasing production is there but the land will not do it unless it gets the necessary nutriments.</P>
    <P>There are other things that we could do to increase agricultural production: by improving the breeds of cattle, improving the quality of seeds of all sorts, and by various other schemes. But the best immediate way to get a quick increase in production from agriculture is through liming and fertilising our soil.</P>
    <P>What did the former Minister for Agriculture do, with the support, of course, of the Fine Gael Party?  He actually put an end to the scheme for the subsidising of ground limestone. A few days ago when I stated that in the Dáil he denied it, but Deputy Allen was able to give the day and date on which he issued the circular to county committees of agriculture putting an end to the ground limestone scheme.  It was absolutely fantastic that in 1948 there should be found a Minister for Agriculture who was against the application of ground limestone to land.  When we were in office it was known that it would require 12,000,000 tons to bring up the calcium content of the soil initially and, annually thereafter, about 2,000,000 tons per year to compensate for loss due to leaching.  Yet, in 1948, the then Minister for Agriculture insisted on getting back from the Department of Industry and Commerce the scheme to produce the lime that the land required.  He insisted on bringing it back to the Department of Agriculture and then squashing it and squashing the subsidy paid to the farmers for the spreading of lime and fertilisers.  It was only in 1951, when he was kicked into it, that he agreed even to accept £1,750,000 out of the Grant Counterpart Fund for the subsidisation of the transport of ground limestone.  I am hoping that the farmers in the coming year will turn to the application of science to their land rather than the application of the outworn ideas of the former Minister for Agriculture in regard to land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> One of the difficulties that the world faces in the future is how to balance its payments with the United States. The great difficulty with the United States Government is how either in goods or services they will balance their agricultural and industrial exports. We must face the situation that even though there might be plenty of wheat in the United States in the future, it is going to be difficult for the world, without some form of all-in agreement, to sell either goods or services to the United States in order to get the dollars to buy the wheat and maize and other things.  So that it is more important than ever that we should have a modern outlook, and realise that if we want to have wheat the thing to do is to grow wheat rather than depend upon producing bullocks to sell for sterling in order to get dollars to buy dollar wheat.  And on balance, there is a terrific amount to be said even from the point of view of narrow finance, leaving aside national security and the social aspects of employment and production within the country, for growing wheat here rather than producing bullocks to sell to England with which to get dollars to buy dollar wheat.</P>
    <P>Take for instance the man with a number of acres.  A two-acre field would with normal care give him, say, an average of one ton, or eight barrels per acre, of wheat.  That is 16 barrels of wheat.  Sixteen barrels of wheat would probably bring him in 150 dollars or so.  I have not got the calculation, but I can make it out again.  However, he gets the 16 barrels of wheat from the two acres.  I remember that figure exactly.  From the same two acres, if he put a bullock on them he would probably get an increase in value of about £20; that £20 would buy him in London enough dollars to get five or six barrels of wheat.  But out of the same two acres, he could produce 16 barrels of wheat for national consumption. So that even from the narrow, financial point of view it is worth while to produce 16 barrels from two acres &mdash;it is not a very big crop from two acres&mdash;rather than put on a bullock to get an extra £20 to buy dollars in the London market to buy a few barrels of wheat in America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> I say we must set ourselves against this outworn idea of the former Minister for Agriculture.  We must take land that is capable of growing wheat and use it to grow wheat, rather than to produce extra value on cattle in the hope of being able to buy dollars to buy dollar wheat.  We must also turn our backs on the attitude that if somebody suggests to the Minister for Agriculture that he should restore the calcium status of the soil and help farmers to put the land into condition to grow pasture and crops the Minister will take up the attitude that this very suggestion makes him mad. We have to carry on utilising all our resources to improve our soil, to improve our factories, to improve our farms, so that we will be able to produce the goods that will give us a higher real standard of life.  It is easy to give the people more pounds per head in terms of sterling or Irish pounds while at the same time their standard of living might go down.  We must continue to live at our present standard of life unless we can get a greater volume of production from the land and from our factories.  It must be the duty of whatever Government is here&mdash;if it is prepared to do its duty &mdash;to promote all activities on the part of the farmer and of all our people to support a production campaign that will give us the goods with which we can live at a higher standard.</P>
    <P>If we are to make that progress, we must not have a Government here who will spend the money that they are not entitled to spend, that will use inflationary finance at an inflationary period and will hand over to the future the bills and headaches that they themselves should face.  We can, in my belief, if we adopt a reasonable attitude to life, make progress here in this country, and as year follows year we can make progress at an increasing rate.  I remember saying to somebody in 1951 when we got back into office that it was quite a different outlook and quite a different prospect we had to face from 1932.  In 1932, if we went to get advice here from Irish people, practically the only expert advice available was how to handle some <Col N="184" /> goods at the ports and how to send cattle out.  There were only two or three industries of any extent in the country.  When we came back in 1951, if you wanted to get any suggestions of almost any kind in relation to an industrial or agricultural project, you could present them with any problem and within a week you could get a half-dozen people who could give advice as good as could be found in practically any country in the world.  One of the things I resented more, I think, than anything else done by the Coalition was the stopping of the mining, the cutting out for the first year on the grounds of economy of the £83,000 devoted to mines; and the selling of the Constellations.  That reduced the number of experts in the country who could be called together to discuss various problems presented to individuals or to the Government.</P>
    <P>It was disastrous that we should have sold the Constellations for sterling, the Fianna Fáil Government having raised the dollars to pay for them. There are some Deputies who think that it is a good thing to say that we were extravagant in having purchased aeroplanes to fly the Atlantic but, as times goes on, our people will come to realise that the purchase of these planes was a sound financial proposition. They can see that quite a big percentage of the people who touch down at Shannon remain in Ireland and spend their dollars here.  They certainly would spend more dollars here if flights originated and ended at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Another very popular criticism with Fine Gael and others of the Fianna Fáil Party was that we actually had the temerity to prepare plans for the building of Government offices here in the city as against the time when there might be an easing-off in the building trade.  Everybody who knows anything about building knows that at any time in Dublin not quite half the building workers were engaged in municipal house building, that the other half were engaged in building for private individuals, the restoration of shop fronts, etc.  During the war, when we were looking forward to the end of the conflict and taking stock of the <Col N="185" /> conditions under which civil servants were housed, not only from the point of view of their health but also from the point of view of efficiency and control in the service, we decided that we should concentrate as many civil servants as we could in a few buildings so that they could be properly supervised and that the general standard of their health might be improved. Deputies will remember all the sneering there was at the idea that we should knock down some parts of the old Dublin Castle and concentrate in new buildings there, members of the service who were in occupation of 80 or 90 private houses in the city, using them as Government offices.  That idea was sneered at and laughed at.</P>
    <P>If we want to get away from the present slump in the building trade, and if the corporation cannot go ahead any more quickly with their housing activities, we have to turn to some scheme of public building that will give the greatest return to the country.  I do not know of any scheme of public building, outside the erection of hospitals and schools&mdash;and that work is going ahead as fast as Government finances can help to drive it&mdash;that will take up the slack in the building trade as quickly or as effectively as the erection of a block of offices for civil servants in the Castle, thus releasing the houses which they now occupy for other uses.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government, however, were not prepared to take the responsibility of building modern offices or of preparing plans for the erection of these offices as against a building slump.  The result was that when they wanted increased accommodation for the Civil Service, they stole it from C.I.E.&mdash;they stole the bus station. Under plans prepared, C.I.E. intended to concentrate a number of their staffs, scattered throughout the city and working under bad conditions from the point of view of administration, in this new building.  But the Government, not wanting to take the responsibility of building themselves, even though they knew that the apace was necessary for these 1,200 civil servants whom they wanted to accommodate, stole the bus station.  That is the type of practice <Col N="186" /> they pursued all during their time. They made excuses of one kind or another for various actions which they took, excuses such as they made for taking over the bus station.</P>
    <P>One of the great arguments with which Fine Gael defended themselves for all the borrowing in which they indulged, was that they were increasing the capital assets of the country.  The amount by which they are shown to have increased capital in their last year was £24,000,000.  Last year we spent £33,000,000 on capital projects and this year we propose to spend £39,000,000.  The truth of the matter is that, for all their extravagance in putting this country into debt, the Coalition Government had at the end of their period very little to show either by way of an increase in capital wealth or output.  They not only increased the annual charge for dead-weight debt, decreased our sterling assets and made a big addition to our foreign debt by way of the 140,000,000 dollars which have to be paid back, but they also brought about a disastrous decrease in agricultural production, a disastrous reduction of over 500,000 acres in the ploughed land of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Higgins for giving me an opportunity to look up my notes.  Deputy Cosgrave had the impudence to-day to talk about expanding agriculture under the Coalition. He spoke about the land rehabilitation scheme initiated by the Coalition and of its great production potentialities. I have described how agricultural production contracted by over 500,000 acres of tillage.  The former Minister for Agriculture refused even to put lime on the grass he so loves and we know that his offer of 1/- per gallon for five years for milk had quite a disastrous result on the number of cows and heifers in calf and on butter production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say it requires a certain amount of impudence even by Coalition standards for anybody to claim <Col N="187" /> that the land rehabilitation scheme was initiated by the Coalition Government. For years, we had had the land improvement scheme under which we gave money to the farmers for the improvement of their land, up to £300,000 or £400,000 per year.  The first thing the former Minister did when he came into office was, in conjunction with Deputy McGilligan, to put an end to that scheme.  They did not start it again until Marshall Aid came along. We were prepared to tax the people to the tune of £400,000 for land rehabilitation, to give our farmers half of the cost.  The Coalition stopped it and the former Minister did not start again on land rehabilitation until he got dollars from America.  He made a speech here on the Agriculture Estimate, in 1948, in which he said that unfortunately they could not go ahead with these schemes but what could they not do, if only they could get a free grant from America?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was completely and absolutely wrong when he talked about the land rehabilitation business being initiated by the Coalition Government. The Fianna Fáil scheme was stopped until they got dollars to do the work. Instead of increasing production from the land they decreased it, very disastrously, and I have no doubt that if Deputy Dillon had his way again he would embark upon the same system of agricultural production and financing as would have the same result. Instead of producing 16 barrels of wheat from two acres of land, a bullock would be placed upon it, the sterling value of which could be increased only to the extent of enabling us to buy a few barrels of wheat.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government, when it left, was bankrupt of ideas and, in addition, had almost driven the country bankrupt.  We hope this Dáil will be wise enough to give the vote of confidence this Government asks, in order that the wise and progressive policy of Fianna Fáil may be pursued during the next three years.  It is very essential, in the world as it is, that we should be making progress in our agricultural production and our <Col N="188" /> industrial production.  We should also be making progress in our social solidarity.  It was very bad for this country that Fine Gael should have strung its life out for three years without having put into operation the Act regarding social security that Fianna Fáil put into operation a very few months after they returned to power. We believe that, under a Fianna Fáil Government, this country will make more progress than under any alternative Government available to our people.  We hope our farmers within the next few years will take advantage of the opportunities open to them to increase production from the land, so that not only will they themselves have a higher standard of life but they will be able to give a better standard of life to those who work with them on the land and to the people as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably suffice to say on this motion that &ldquo;a Government whose position has been weakened and might be questioned could not hope to deal effectively with the conditions that may confront the country in the coming year.&rdquo;  It might also suffice to say that, &ldquo;in a democratic country, it is for the people to say how and by whom they will be ruled.&rdquo;  These two statements are statements made by the Taoiseach in October, 1947, when he had lost two out of three by-elections, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st November, 1947.  But I think it might be well also to say that, not only would the Government not get a vote of confidence from the people, if a general election were to be held now or at any time in the future, but that the people would be slow to give confidence to this House as a whole.  I do not think the behaviour of our Parliament in the course of the last couple of years has in any way enhanced its prestige or created confidence in the minds of the people.  I think that the people are sick and tired of the type of Party politics we have here and sick and tired of the constant recriminations.  In the final analysis, all the people wants is an efficient and competent Government. They are not interested in the lucubrations that take place in this House. <Col N="189" /> They may read them because the papers publish them, but they read them with a certain feeling of irritation and in the knowledge that that is the sort of thing that is being carried on in the nation's Parliament instead of any serious attempt being made to deal with the various problems that face the country.</P>
      <P>It was for those reasons that in 1951, after the general election at that time, I urged, as I had urged in 1948, that we should seek to establish a national Government representative of the main Parties here.  I think we adopted too readily both the political and the economic institutions of the country that had occupied us for centuries.  We probably did that at a time when we had not had much opportunity of considering such matters seriously.  We did it at a time of revolution, at a time when the best leaders the country had and the best brains had died in the course of that revolution.  Those of us who carried on were young.  We were there largely by accident and reached positions in public life largely by accident. I am not saying that in derogation of any colleague who took an active part in the independence movement but I think they will themselves agree that at the time when we all joined in that movement for independence we had given very little thought to the economic and political problems that faced the nation.</P>
      <P>It was a period of resurgence and enthusiasm.  We joined in but unfortunately during that period men like Griffith, Connolly, Pearse, Clarke, all the older and wiser men, the men who had been the brains and the inspiration of the movement, ceased to be with us. We were left to carry on alone.  We carried on full of enthusiasm, full of patriotism but very often with very little wisdom.  In addition to that, we indulged in the luxury of a civil war, a war which prevented any kind of objective thinking.  We grew up in that way with the type of assembly we have here to-day and with the type of economic institutions that exist to-day. I think there are few Deputies here who, if they were honest with themseleves, would not admit that this type of Parliament and our present type of Party politics are far from satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> This nation has tremendous tasks ahead.  It has the task, first of all, of securing the territorial unity of the country.  That in itself will require the united effort of all our people for its achievement.  It will require the best brains in the country.  Secondly, we have the task of the economic reconstruction of the country because, while we have obtained our political freedom, I do not think we have availed of that freedom to achieve our economic independence.  After 30 years of independence we have 12½ per cent. of our working population unemployed. After 30 years we still continue to export 40,000 to 50,000 of our people every year.</P>
    <P>Is that what we fought for?  Does that situation comply with the ideals we had when we sought to establish the freedom of this country?  One can test that very easily by reading Connolly or Pearse or Griffith, or any of our national fathers.  Is it not time we took stock of our position?  Let us try now to find out what is wrong. By all means let us give credit to everybody in public life.  Let us not attribute ill-motives to anyone, but let us realise the problems that confront the country. Let us examine these problems objectively. Let us try to improve on the present position.</P>
    <P>We adopted a very amorphous set of political institutions.  We adopted proportional representation which is, I think, probably the fairest system of election.  But, to be logical however, if proportional representation is to work satisfactorily it will have to be extended from the House to the Government itself.  The best type of Government would be a representative Government somewhat on the lines of the Swiss form where most of the Parties have representation in Government and share in the responsibility of governing.  Naturally the dominant policy is the policy of the Party that has the biggest majority.  Naturally the Opposition is based on the minority Party, but in that way one ensures that one has the most competent public men in one's Parliament and in one's Government.  Each Party naturally takes care to ensure that each representative in the Government will be as competent and as able as they <Col N="191" /> can have them.  I think the time has come when we should seriously consider that position.  I urged these considerations at the time of the change of Government in 1951.  They were objected to by the Taoiseach.  I had also urged them in 1948 and received no response.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government was an attempt in that direction.  It was representative of a group of different Parties and it had one element which rendered it of particular value.  It represented the organised Labour movement.  It represented the trade union movement.  In my view a modern Government, particularly in a country such as ours where half the population is an industrial population, should always contain representatives of organised labour.  I think it is essential for good government.  I think it would be highly desirable if every Government we had in this country contained representatives of organised labour.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government was a new departure in political life here but it worked well.  I am not here discussing the political issues involved in this debate.  It was a sane and sensible form of Government where representatives of the different Parties met and argued the very divergent viewpoints which often existed and convinced each other of the merits of their respective viewpoints.  In this way agreement on the policy to be pursued was arrived at.  I think that was healthy.  It meant that each member of the Government had to work considerably harder.  It meant that each member of the Government had to know what he was talking about and it meant that no one member of the Government could try either to secure positions or advantages for his own particular purposes.</P>
    <P>I think that the people liked and had confidence in that type of Government. The viewpoint has grown up throughout the country, particularly in the course of the last year, that that is the best type of Government.  However, I suppose it will be difficult in present circumstances to convince the Taoiseach that representative Government is the best type of Government, <Col N="192" /> but I think we owe it to the people to behave with a greater sense of responsibility in our public life than we do here.  I think we owe it to the people at least to be in a position to inform them as to the true facts of the situation.  The difficulty that exists in ascertaining facts and in getting acceptance of certain fundamental facts is one of the matters that makes me despair of our political life from time to time.</P>
    <P>Since yesterday we have heard in this House a rehash of many speeches which we heard in the course of last year and also in the course of the recent by-election campaigns with certain variations.  What are the facts of the situation?  How can we examine the merits or demerits of a policy until we can at least get truthfully to the actual facts of the situation?</P>
    <P>This debate has ranged over a great many subjects but unemployment is undoubtedly the most important factor in the present situation and it has loomed large in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>What are the facts in regard to unemployment? At the moment, according to the latest statistics, we had on the 20th June last 64,835 people unemployed. Members of the Government have in the course of the last couple of months made a number of statements to the effect that unemployment was going down.  It is quite true.  Unemployment does go down towards the end of the winter and through the summer and then starts creeping up again.  But that happens every year. Anybody with the slighest knowledge of statistics or of economics knows that and knows that the only way in which you can assess the employment position is by comparing one period in any one year with the equivalent period in another year.  That is elementary.  So that, when members of the Government say that unemployment has been going down, they are saying something which is factually true but which they know perfectly well is intended to mislead.</P>
    <P>The alarming fact about the unemployment position is that it has been getting progressively worse since the <Col N="193" /> beginning of this year.  If you compare the unemployment at the end of every month since the beginning of this year with the unemployment that existed in 1951 and 1952 you find that it has been getting progressively worse with the exception of one month.  On the last Saturday in January of this year there were 21,406 more people unemployed than on the last Saturday in January, 1951.  That was an increase of 34 per cent. over the position which obtained in 1951.  In February there were 26,547 more people unemployed than in February, 1951.  That was an increase of 42.1 per cent.  On the last Saturday of March there were 25,972 more people unemployed than in March of 1951&mdash;an increase of 43.6 per cent. In April there were 29,128 more people unemployed.  That was an increase of 53 per cent. over the equivalent period in 1951.  In May the increase had gone down to 19,747 over the equivalent figure for the end of May, 1951.  That was an increase of 41.5 per cent.  On the 20th June, there were 27,814 more people unemployed than on the last Saturday of June, 1951.  That is an increase of 75.1 per cent. in the figure of unemployment over the period from the last Saturday of June, 1951, to the 20th June this year.</P>
    <P>The alarming factor about the unemployment situation is that it has shown a tendency to increase steadily since the beginning of the year and that it is becoming progressively worse.  At the present figure of 64,835, unemployment is now higher than it has been any time since 1939.  It should not be necessary to have to state all these facts.  These are some of the facts which should be accepted, but I am quite certain that this afternoon, or tomorrow, speeches will be made here, and will be made in the country, completely contrary to these facts; or statements that have no bearing on the facts will be made to try to suggest that the unemployment position is not serious.  In order that any Deputy who wishes to take the trouble to examine the position will have the facts on record, let me give the unemployment figures since 1939, at the end of June in that year and in the following years. At the end of June, 1939, the figure <Col N="194" /> was 70,470; 1940, 59,428; 1941, 56,061; 1942, 56,644; 1943, 49,901; 1944, 45,121; 1945, 43,556; 1946, 45,748; 1947, 40,843; 1948, 45,269; 1949, 45,505; 1950, 39,881. At the end of June, 1951, the figure went down to 37,125, and it is now up to 64,835, an increase of 75 per cent. over June, 1951.</P>
    <P>What explanations have been given for this situation from the Government Benches?  First of all, it was denied that there was any serious unemployment. Then we were told that it was due to the Social Welfare Act.  It is quite true that the Social Welfare Act had the effect of changing the number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and of adding them to the persons in receipt of unemployment benefits under the Insurance Acts; but, beyond that, it had little or no effect on the figures.  An examination of the figures at the time that Act came into operation shows that; likewise a comparison between the 1951 and 1952 figures shows the true position.</P>
    <P>We were next told that it was because people came back from England, and that a large percentage of those drawing unemployment benefits were people who had fled from England and had come back here.  Does that bear examination?  There was a question asked in the House by Deputy Norton on the 11th February.  He asked for a return of persons drawing unemployment benefits, that is persons on the live register, who had returned from Britain, at the end of January in each year from 1948 to 1953.  The return showed that the figure was a constant figure ranging about 4,000 every year. In 1948 it was 4,862; 1949, 4,377; 1950, 4,843; 1951, 4,048; 1952, 3,100; 1953, 4,261.  These figures explode the suggestions that were put forward by responsible Ministers, including the Taoiseach, that the present unemployment position is due to returning emigrants.  He should not be allowed to make use of misleading information of that kind.  The Taoiseach probably, no doubt, believed this statement when it was given to him.</P>
    <P>That is an example of the difficulty that seems to exist in ascertaining what the facts of the situation are.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="195" /> has advanced the reason that unemployment was due to stockpiling.  The Taoiseach has also advanced that reason, but an examination of a breakdown of the figures of the live register disposes of that.  The Taoiseach and I had some words about it in the House on the 11th February, 1953.  I pointed out to the Taoiseach, at column 699, that his own newspaper had said that the unemployment figures arose mainly from unemployment in building construction and transport.  The Taoiseach interjected to say that he thought it was &ldquo;mainly agricultural,&rdquo; again showing, apparently, that very little attention had been given to the actual cause of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The latest breakdown in the unemployment figures is one which was given in the Dáil on the 27th May last, to be found in column 3 of that day's report.  It shows an increase in unemployment in practically every trade and industry.  I am not going to weary the House by quoting the figures in full.  They will be found in the Dáil debates for that day.</P>
    <P>Now, in addition we have had many conflicting statements made, mainly by back benchers, as regards employment. They claim that more employment has been provided.  The Tánaiste has said &mdash;and his statement was echoed by the Taoiseach yesterday&mdash;that the success or otherwise of the Government had to be judged by the amount of employment which they provided.  That is the position in regard to employment. Again, it should not be necessary to have to point out these figures, to have to come here armed with statistics of all kinds.  These facts should surely be capable of admission so that at least we could approach the problem knowing what the facts of the situation are.</P>
    <P>On the 16th June of this year, at column 1251 of that day's report, I obtained the figures of the number of male farm workers employed.  It showed that on the 1st June, 1950, 470,006 were employed; on 1st June, 1951, the number was 452,704; on 1st June, 1952, it was 441,256.  That is a decline of 11,000 in the number of men employed on farms.  On the same date <Col N="196" /> I obtained also from the Taoiseach's Department the figures also published in that day's report of the number employed in the transportable goods industries. It showed that in the first quarter of 1951 there were 139.4 thousand; by the first quarter of 1952 it had fallen to 135.3 thousand; and by the first quarter of 1953 it had fallen to 134.8 thousand.</P>
    <P>What is the position about the building industry?  The figures published in the <i>Trade Journal</i> show that the number employed in local authority building works in December, 1950, was 11.8 thousand; in December, 1951, it was 11.1 thousand, and in December, 1952, it had fallen to 8.6 thousand.  You will find a corresponding fall in regard to those employed by local authorities in house building.  The figures, I think, were quoted by Deputy Norton yesterday.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts of the situation established by the Government's own statistics.  Here I want to take the Taoiseach to task for doing something which is, I think, unworthy of him and unworthy of the position he occupies. In the course of the recent by-election campaign the Taoiseach made use of a word which he uses from time to time when he descends from the Olympian heights where he prefers to remain usually and spoke about &ldquo;falsehoods&rdquo; which the Opposition were spreading about the situation.  &ldquo;Falsehoods&rdquo; is a favourite word of his on these occasions.  He proceeded to deal with the unemployment figures and to say &ldquo;The fact is that the lowest figure on the live register recorded since 1933 was 34,978 for the 6th September, 1947, when we and not the Coalition were in office.  &ldquo;What was that statement intended to convey?  It is clearly intended to convey that in 1947 when Fianna Fáil were in office unemployment was lower than it was during the years of the inter-Party Government and that that was the lowest figure on record.  Of course that statement was completely untrue.  I do not know whether the figure of 34,978 was actually made up&mdash;I assume it was not &mdash;but it was the figure for one day in in that year.  The average unemployment figure for the whole of that year <Col N="197" /> was 55,000 and if you turn to the figures published in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the month of September, 1947, you will find that it was 37,462.</P>
    <P>Can any responsible person stand over a practice of that kind, to pick the figures for one week in a year and quote those as representative of the whole year when, in point of fact, the unemployment figures for the whole year amounted to an average of 55,000? One might forgive a back bencher for behaving like that; or might forgive a back bencher for rooting through figures to get one day in the year but surely one is entitled to expect a higher sense of responsibility from a Minister and from the head of the Government. I think it was unworthy and that this is the type of practice that should be done away with in our public life.  It was particularly unworthy as it was on the basis of such figure juggling that the Taoiseach levelled his charge of &ldquo;falsehood&rdquo; against his political opponents which was published with great gusto by his own newspaper with the title: &ldquo;Taoiseach Exposes Coalition &lsquo;Untruths&rsquo;,&rdquo; with two photographs of the Taoiseach showing how he scored his point.  I am quite prepared to make him a present of that type of point.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Taoiseach's speech and the speeches made by other members of the Government since this debate began to hear what remedy would be proposed.  We heard of &ldquo;plans&rdquo;, very general plans, no details.  The nearest we had was to-day, when the Minister for External Affairs, of all people, proceeded to talk about rebuilding Dublin Castle.  We certainly heard of no constructive plan. We were not given any information as to what steps, if any, the Government propose to take to deal with the unemployment position.</P>
    <P>What is the cause of unemployment? Is it a disease that is spread by a germ?  Is it due to the weather?  Is it something uncontrollable, which is purely accidental and over which the Government has no influence, or is it something which can be controlled? What does unemployment arise from?</P>
    <P>In olden times, possibly, the economic <Col N="198" /> policy of a Government was limited to the collection of taxes and the payment of outgoings.  It has long since been recognised that the economic policy of a Government is the all-important factor in determining the employment and unemployment position in any country and that unemployment and employment can be created practically at will by the economic policy of a Government.</P>
    <P>The causes of the unemployment situation that exists here and that has been mounting up for the last two years are quite simple.  It is due to the restriction of credits and to the reduction in the purchasing power of people which was induced in order to reduce consumption.  There is no necessity to be an economist to appreciate that.  It is quite obvious that if you restrict credit and if you reduce the purchasing power of the people, the people will buy less, that in turn the shopkeepers will sell less and that in turn again the producers and the manufacturers will sell less to the shopkeepers and to the public; in that way unemployment grows in the distributive trades and in the manufacturing and producing trades.  That is what is happening in this instance.  The minute you restrict credits you are going to kill trade.</P>
    <P>Walk through the streets of Dublin and you will see houses for sale everywhere just because people have not got the money to buy houses.  Everybody knows that houses are built and bought on credit and the minute credit was restricted you were bound to create unemployment, you were bound to prevent the building and the selling of houses, the manufacture of goods and to prevent increased production. It is hardly necessary to elaborate this, it is all so obvious but quite apart from that, I think that these facts were fully appreciated by the Government, certainly if one can judge by the speeches made by different members of the Government in the House.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste gave me some hope by a statement he made in the course of a speech in the early days after the change of Government.</P>
    <P>There had been a motion put down by the Labour Party in regard to the <Col N="199" /> unemployment situation that existed in the country at the time and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was the principal Government spokesman on the motion, dealt with the situation.  He gave me some hope at the time by his approach that he realised the problems that existed and was prepared to face up to them.  On 14th February, 1952, at column 675, Volume 129, Dáil Debates, the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the situation which has begun to develop during last year. Nobody could have expected that it would come suddenly upon us.  It was clearly to be anticipated that it would develop gradually and I think we must take it that the first signs of its coming are with us now and, if we are to take effective action to check that trend, it is now we have to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on, at column 676:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, however, it will become clear, I think, that there are forces at work which will affect people in their daily lives, either through the impact of prices upon the cost of living or through the diminution of trade leading to unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 677, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear, therefore, that any contraction in demand, any factors operating to induce people to buy less, are bound to have repercussions upon the output and the employment given in these industries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was quite a correct assessment of the position.  That statement was made on 14th February, 1952&mdash;before the removal of the food subsidies.  He pointed out quite correctly that any factor which was bound to lead to contraction in demand and, therefore, any factor which led to a reduction in purchasing power was bound to cause unemployment.  That was his assessment of the position at the time.  The situation which was developing had to be dealt with urgently and the time had come when there could be no further delay in dealing with it.  How was it dealt with?  It was dealt with by removing the food subsidies and by still further <Col N="200" /> reducing the purchasing power of the people so that certainly as far as the Tánaiste was concerned he knew what the effect of the Government's budgetary policy was to be.  He had no illusions about it and knew the remedies which were essential in February, 1952, but a completely contrary policy was in fact pursued.</P>
    <P>We had a completely different type of indication from the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance gave I think the first clear indication of what the Government's real attitude was to be because there is no way of reconciling the speeches by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House and the speeches by the Minister for Finance.  On the 18th July, 1951 at column 1899 the Minister for Finance outlined his policy.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Private and public spending are causing congestion that can be relieved only by a reduction of one or the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A reduction of either public or private spending.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Credit facilities are encouraging outlay on less essential goods; money incomes of all kinds are being raised irrespective of increases in output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a clear statement of the old conservative Tory policy of deflation. Public and private spending were causing congestion, one or the other had to be stopped, if not both.  Credit facilities were encouraging outlay, therefore credit facilities had to be curtailed.  That was a completely different type of policy from the policy enunciated by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to credit?  Again, we had difficulty in this House in order to find out what the actual situation was in regard to bank credits.  I raised the matter fairly early on in February, 1952, with the Tánaiste.  The Tánaiste said to that at column 678:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think this situation is affected one way or the other by the question of bank credit.  We could have gone to the banks and have said: &lsquo;We want you to keep on giving extended credit facilities to enable traders to retain these abnormal stocks that they are holding.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> And then in the same column he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May I say as definitely as I can that the Government gave no instruction or advice to the banks to curtail credit facilities?  May I say also that while I do not pretend to be familiar with the private instructions which bank directors may have given to their branch managers, in so far as I have been made aware of them, while there was definite warning against increasing credit facilities, I did not see in them any suggestion that there should be curtailment as a matter of general policy?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then a little bit further on at column 696 while I was speaking, Mr. Lemass interrupted me and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You cannot say there has been a reduction in the bank advances. They may not be extending at the same rate but they have not been reducing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Sweetman: The banks have told their customers that they must be reduced.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: The total volume of bank advances is higher than ever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a categorical statement.  The Taoiseach also discussed this question of credits in the course of a debate here on the 11th February, 1953, when he stated at column 723 that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was no evidence of it in any of the figures I saw before I went away&mdash;none.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No evidence of restriction of credit. And in the next column I drew attention to a circular which had been circulated by the Department of Finance in which the Department boasted of the fact that credit had been restricted by 2 per cent.  Bank advances had been restricted by 2 per cent.  To that the Taoiseach replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All I know is the figures of bank advances had not diminished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I drew his attention to the fact that this circular had been circulated by the Department of Finance, and referred to the fact that the bank rate was acting as an additional credit restriction.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach denied that construction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> What is the position with regard to credit restriction?  We now know the truth because the figures have had to be published.  We know that in the course of last year the banks reduced their advances in this country by £4,750,000.  The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach denied that such credit restrictions had taken place, or said that if they had taken place they did not know of it.  Why are they in office? What is the purpose of a Government if it is not to find out what the situation in the country is?  But in any case they knew perfectly well the advice which the Central Bank had given.  They refused to reject that advice. They refused to disown that advice publicly.  They were invited to do it in this House, and beyond a dramatic statement made by the Tánaiste that he was not going to allow the Central Bank Report to be tied around his neck, members of the Government refused to disown the advice given by the Central Bank in that report.  The Central Bank did not mince their words as to their desires with regard to credit restriction.  At page 16 of their report they advocated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rigorous restriction of bank credit for non-essential and less urgent purposes is now imperative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same report also advocated, of course, the removal of the subsidies, and gave its reasons, that consumption should be reduced and the purchasing power of the people should be reduced. They added this sentence, which I have always felt was ironical:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that removal of subsidy might tend somewhat to increase the cost of living but some inconvenience in this respect must be weighed against the compensating gains including especially the reduction of consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be pretty hard to beat that as a statement of policy, even among the most conservative economists of the last century.</P>
    <P>It was the same report, of course, that did not put a tooth in it in regard to unemployment.  They recorded that steps should be taken to remedy what they described as &ldquo;the <Col N="203" /> unusually favourable state of employment&rdquo; in the country.  The only meaning that could be taken from that report is that they advocated the creation of an unemployment pool.  That is the policy which the Government has been implementing.</P>
    <P>The Government were invited repeatedly in the course of the year to disown various portions of the report, to indicate what their attitude was in regard to credit.  Instead of that, we got long speeches here lauding to the skies the various members of the Central Bank.  The Minister for Finance told us that these men were the watchdogs of the people, that they were only speaking the truth and that it was very necessary to have their advice.  Step by step the Government accepted their advice and implemented it; and now we have the results of that.  The result is unemployment 75 per cent. higher than this time two years ago, business and trade dislocated and the purchasing power of money reduced.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputies realise that although an old age pensioner to-day gets 21/6 a week nominally, he is getting only 9/4 in terms of 1938 money. He is getting now less than the 10/- a week he was getting before the war. Therefore, with all the vaunted increases we have given to the old age pensioner, and that we are supposed to have given every recipient of social welfare benefit, they are now worse off than before the war.  The unemployed man gets less by way of assistance or benefit than he got before the war in terms of purchasing power &mdash;and, of course, the only use of money, the only value of money is its power to purchase goods.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Minister for External Affairs waxing eloquent to-day about the dangers of inflation. I wish he and his colleagues would learn what the meaning of inflation is and how it can arise.  The way in which that word was bandied about last night by the Minister for Lands and to-day by the Minister for External Affairs is nobody's business.  It shows that they have not the slightest conception of the economic position of the country.  In <Col N="204" /> so far as the purchasing power of money has been reduced, it is due principally to the action of the Government in removing the food subsidies.  That had the effect of increasing the cost of every essential commodity.  That is what has reduced the value of money in the course of the last year, as far as the people are concerned.  Then we have the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste coming in here and saying: &ldquo;Oh, we did not know that credit had been restricted at all; we had no idea of it&rdquo;&mdash;though their own newspaper published articles about it and their own Department of Finance circulated documents boasting of the fact that credit had been restricted.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I think it is well to deal on this occasion and which has played an important part in discussions in this House and also during the by-elections is Marshall Aid. We have been accused, first of all, of having put the country in pawn to a foreign power, the foreign power being America.  We have been accused of having squandered the proceeds of the Marshall Aid money.  These accusations have been levelled right, left and centre in the course of the last two years. What are the facts in regard to Marshall Aid?</P>
    <P>The first proposal in regard to Marshall Aid was made at a conference which met in Paris in July, 1947, and which was attended by no less a person than the Tánaiste, who was accompanied by no less a person than the present Minister for Local Government, who was then Minister for Agriculture. The Government had received the invitation on the 4th July from the British Government to attend this conference.  On the 9th July a note accepting the invitation was actually despatched and it contained the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland accept this invitation with pleasure and have nominated Mr. Séan Lemass, T.D., Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce,, and Mr. Patrick Smith, T.D., Minister for Agriculture, to represent Ireland at the Paris meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in July, 1947.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, as <Col N="205" /> he then was, flew to Paris by special plane.  They had five or six officials or more.  Any Deputy interested in seeing the officials who accompanied them and seeing the photographs of the arrivals and departures will find them in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the period in detail&mdash;a world-shaking event.</P>
    <P>A committee was set up as a result of that conference, to prepare the Marshall Aid agreements, the details of the Marshall Aid plan.  Mr. Boland, who is now our Ambassador in London, was the chief Irish representative on that committee.  The committee sat from then until September.  On the 20th September, 1947, the Taoiseach, accompanied by about ten officials, took himself off on a special plane to Paris and signed the first Marshall Aid agreement.  Again if Deputies are interested in getting the background of the situation at the time, they can look up the <i>Irish Press</i> files in the Library of the House for the period.  They will see the moving description of how the Taoiseach at 5.32 p.m. on the afternoon of the 22nd September signed the preliminary agreement and they will also see plenty of photographs of it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was questioned in this House in regard to Marshall Aid and in regard to this conference.  The documentation was laid in the Library of this House in the month of October, 1947.  One of the first tasks which I had as Minister for External Affairs was to review the list of commodities that were to be imported under Marshall Aid by this country and to eliminate from that list a number of goods which had been included in it previously by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and to cut them out.  If Deputies want confirmation of that, they will find the confirmation in the Official Debates of the House.  They will also see a statement from the Tánaiste that every single item in that list of goods should be imported and was necessary.  It was the list of goods prepared by himself and the Fianna Fáil Government of the day.  It included many things which I considered unnecessary at the time&mdash;railway carriages, coal and various goods of that kind.  That list was prepared by <Col N="206" /> Fianna Fáil in 1947 or the beginning of 1948 and was handed in.</P>
    <P>Is it honest, in these circumstances, for members of the Government Party to go around the country saying that Ireland should not have participated in Marshall Aid?  In addition, every single transaction relating to Marshall Aid was brought before this House. The agreements, the loans and everything else were brought before this House, discussed in this House and approved of in this House.  Speeches were made by the Taoiseach saying how necessary it was.  But, of course, that did not matter, in the game of Party politics.  If you have a newspaper, the more blatant the lies spread the more likely some of the mud is to stick.  That was used to full account in regard to Marshall Aid.</P>
    <P>At the same time, while all this propaganda was going on, the Minister for Finance proceeded to set up a cry of desperation.  He told the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis that &ldquo;the Government were being put to the pin of their collar to maintain the value of the Irish pound on a parity basis with the British pound.&rdquo;  Utter nonsense.  I shall quote now from a speech made by the Minister for Finance on 21st May, 1952, as reported at column 2163 of the Official Report, Volume 131, No. 14:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . the Coalition during their three years in office, reduced our net external assets by almost £150,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Figures do not matter, of course.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . not only did the Coalition Government squander our net external assets but they have further impaired our economic independence by loading us with foreign debt&mdash;at the instance, let this be borne in mind, of a foreign power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He repeated it again, to be quite certain that people would understand what he was saying and that it would get its full publicity:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been loaded with foreign debt at the instance of a foreign power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;on foot, let it be said of the agreements that they signed, on foot of the agreements which were passed by this <Col N="207" /> House without a word of disapproval from any single member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  As reported at column 2165 of the Official Report of 21st May, 1952, Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance, asked a question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why they pursued a policy which has impaired our economic independence, has put the country in pawn and has jeopardised its political future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A couple of columns further on, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . they have compromised seriously and dangerously the economy&mdash;and, therefore, political independence&mdash;of the State that was committed to their care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 2168, he declared that the country was on the edge of a precipice. I could give the House many further quotations of the types of irresponsible statements made by the Minister for Finance&mdash;statements that were particularly irresponsible as they were untrue and as they were calculated to damage the credit of this country from an economic point of new and to damage our relations with America.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to bear this in mind.  The alternative to our having relations with the outside world is to be dependent on Britain.  The only way in which we can balance and develop our economy is by balancing our relations with countries other than Britain. Every time anybody pursues an anti-American line on economic matters in this House, he is, in effect, urging our complete dependence on Britain.  But it suited the game of Party politics at the time to suggest that this country had been put in pawn as a result of American pressure and that the future political and economic independence of the country was in jeopardy.  Even during the course of the recent by-elections, we have seen the Taoiseach's paper come out with headlines calling for independence&mdash;&ldquo;The Independence of the Country is at Stake.&rdquo;  It suited the game of Party politics to suggest that America was jeopardising the political and the economic independence of this State.  Some of the Independent Deputies who supported <Col N="208" /> the Government had strong anti-American views which they did not omit to voice in this House.  In order to curry favour with them, it was then quite all right to suggest that the country had sold its political independence to the United States.  It did not matter whether or not that damaged our relations with the United States so long as the game of Party politics was being played in a way that ensured that the Government would remain in office. The welfare and the future of the country did not matter.  Our relations with America did not matter.  Nothing mattered.  Declarations of that kind enabled propaganda to be made by some of these Independent Deputies who were not slow to avail of the occasion to stir up muddied waters in order to draw attention to themselves.</P>
    <P>Roughly, that is the history of political events here in the course of the past year or so.  I should also have adverted to the fact that, while we were in office, and since, we endured a very considerable amount of criticism in regard to the trade agreement we made with Britain: (1) because it was a trade agreement that favoured a ranching policy and (2) because there was a limitation in the agreement which prevented the export of more than 10 per cent. of our total cattle exports to countries other than Britain.  Certain Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches will remember clearly the speeches which they listened to&mdash;and some of which they probably delivered themselves&mdash;attacking me and the members of the last Government on foot of that agreement. The present Government have now made a fresh agreement with Britain. Not only does it include that limitation of 10 per cent. but it applies that limitation of 10 per cent. to carcase meat as well and it enunciates the policy of the Government in regard to the beef trade.  The first article of the annex reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the desire of both Governments that the production of live stock in Ireland should be increased and that the trade in live stock and meat between the two countries should be developed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> Then Article 3 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland undertake that exports of live cattle and carcase beef to countries other than the United Kingdom shall not in any year exceed 10 per cent. of the total exports of live cattle and carcase beef from Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>References were made by the Taoiseach yesterday and by the Minister for Lands to O.E.E.C. reports. The Minister for Lands, in reply to an interjection from me, quoted from a report published in 1951.  That is not very much help in regard to the condition of things which exists in 1953.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity, however, to refer to one or two statements contained in the O.E.E.C. report published in December 1952.  At page 184 of that report we have a statement as to the position in regard to prices.  The Taoiseach stated that the situation was as bad in other countries as it was here in regard to prices.  At page 184 of that report there is this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost-of-living index in almost every country during the first nine months of 1952 did not move by more than 2 per cent. in either direction. Generally speaking, therefore, there is at the moment no inflationary pressure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it fair to come to this house and misquote reports and juggle with figures in order to maintain your side in a Party political game?  The same report is interesting in some other respects.  It points to what has been happening generally and suggests some remedies.  At page 186 it deals with the question of wage policy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The restraint of wages is more difficult in countries where the fiscal system allows the incidence of taxation to be passed on to the consumer; in such countries any increase in taxation, particularly if this is already high is likely to raise the cost of living and would lead to new wage claims.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a warning against a system of taxation where the incidence of taxa-is passed on to the consumer, and of <Col N="210" /> course the removal of the food subsidies had the net effect of passing on taxation to the consumer.  Then at page 88, this report deals with the question of bank interest:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the United Kingdom the bank rate was raised by ½ per cent. in November, 1951, and was made effective at the new level, this being the first increase in 19 years, except for a very temporary rise in 1939.  A further 1½ per cent. rise to 4 per cent. in March, 1952, induced a major movement in the Treasury Bill rate and the rates for other short-term securities.  Steps were taken by the United Kingdom Government at the same time to prevent the higher interest rates from adversely affecting the housing programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course no such steps were taken here.  We copied them, but did not take any of the steps they took to ensure that the increase in interest charges by the banks would not halt the housing or public works programmes. The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, the official discount rates were raised during the early phase of inflation following the outbreak of the Korean war, but were subsequently lowered to meet changing conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course we did not lower our bank rate of interest.  It would not suit the Central Bank or the Bank of England. We maintained the same level of interest charges and did not follow the example of other countries who lowered them.  The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increases in official discount rates not only made credit dearer but also tended (apart from the controls examined below) to make it scarcer since they were interpreted by the banking system as an indication of the Government's determination to obtain a more restrictive lending policy.</P>
    <P>In the last few months, there has been a moderate relaxation of restrictive monetary policies in some countries.  Apart from a few reductions in bank rates (mentioned above), the Netherlands have suspended the commercial bank reserve <Col N="211" /> requirements and Germany has reduced them.  Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands have taken special steps to prevent credit restrictions or high interest rates from adversely affecting housing construction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We did not take any of these steps. We followed willy nilly the policy laid down for us by the British Treasury. Indeed I was surprised to see some articles published recently, written I think by Professor Busteed of Cork University and by the, until recently, chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation, in the Government's own Sunday newspaper, complaining that our Central Bank and the commercial banks accepted dictation willy nilly from the British Treasury&mdash;surprised not at the views but surprised that these views should be published in the Fianna Fáil paper.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the question of our sterling assets.  We had a long lecture this morning from the Minister for External Affairs.  He made use of strong language and emulated his colleague the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He said that it was treachery for anyone to increase debt, that inflationary finance was treacherous.  He said that anyone who advocated the pursuit of such a policy was guilty of treachery.  That reminded me of a statement made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs recently, that anyone who advocated the repatriation of sterling assets was guilty of treachery.  It amounts to the same thing, because the policy which the Minister for External Affairs was advocating in this House to-day was a policy destined to accumulate sterling assets, to prevent the utilisation of these sterling assets here.  Certainly it is a new definition of &ldquo;treachery&rdquo; to suggest that anybody who says that we should use our own savings and earnings in this country instead of lending them to Britain is guilty of treachery.  If I were inclined to want to use the word &ldquo;treachery&rdquo; I would be more inclinded to use it in regard to people who persistently pursue the policy of exporting the earnings and savings of the people instead of utilising them in Ireland.  That seems <Col N="212" /> to me a nearer description of what amounts to treachery.  I do not apply the word treachery to the Government or to the Minister for External Affairs but I do apply the word stupidity to him and to him probably more than to the other members of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder do members of the House ever ask themselves what the British Government does with the money borrowed from us?  What do they do with this £300,000,000 or £400,000,000?  They are not stupid people.  Our Central Bank lends them something like £70,000,000.  Our Government Departments about £40,000,000, and our commercial banks lend them about £100,000,000.  What do they do with them?  They use them for the very purposes for which we should use them ourselves, for afforestation, for farms, for subsidies, to build new schools, new hospitals and to provide employment for their people.  They are used, incidentally, in order to pay for the occupation of part of our country.  That is the use which is made of our money.</P>
    <P>Coming to this question of sterling assets I have met the usual difficulty as to the ascertainment of the facts and getting these facts accepted.  The Taoiseach in a speech in the course of a recent by-election said they had dwindled down to £120,000,000 as a result of the profligacy and waste of sterling assets indulged in by the inter-Party Government and that we now had only £120,000,000 left.  Of course, again that is untrue&mdash;completely untrue&mdash;and can be proved to be untrue. Most of the figures can be obtained&mdash; not all of them but most of them&mdash;and they show at the moment, this year, that our Central Bank holds £71.4 million; the Government Departments hold £41.5 million and the commercial banks hold £246,000,000&mdash;that is £358.9 million.  The only statistics that are not available, at least in respect of which no official statistics are available, are in regard to holdings of sterling assets by private persons and firms but these are usually accepted as amounting to approximately £160,000,000, based on an estimate made a number of years ago and accepted by the Department of Finance <Col N="213" /> at least for the last few years, and I think it can be taken that they are still not less than £160,000,000.  In fact we have well over £500,000,000 invested in England.  I would say it is simply untrue for the Taoiseach or any member of the Government to say that our sterling assets have dwindled to £120,000,000.  The facts are as I have stated.  Deputies can check the figures. They will obtain them in replies to questions I asked from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in proposing his motion yesterday placed a lot of emphasis on the need for making progress with prudence and caution.  He emphasised the words &ldquo;prudence&rdquo; and &ldquo;caution&rdquo; on many occasions in the course of his speech.  I wonder is it prudent and cautions to export our money and lend it to another Government?  Have Deputies ever asked themselves how much we lost last year by doing so?  In a reply to a question the other day I learned that as far as the Government holdings by themselves are concerned, we had lost by reason of depreciation in the value of British Government securities something like £6,000,000 in the course of last year.  That was on the holdings by Government Departments themselves.  That is only, of course, a very small proportion of the sterling assets held.  If you apply that percentage to the total you will find that in the course of last year this country had probably lost well over £80,000,000 by reason of the fall in the value of British Government securities. That is quite apart from the fall in purchasing power of money, because every year that money has been reducing in purchasing power.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question recently the Statistics Office informed me that in terms of import prices, £1,000,000 in 1939 was now worth £278,000&mdash;in other words, our money has lost three-quarters of its value in terms of import prices.  In addition to the actual loss in value of British Government securities which has taken place in the course of last year we have lost also in terms of the purchasing power of money.  It seems to me that there can be no more incautious and imprudent policy to pursue than to pursue the policy which <Col N="214" /> leads to exporting the earnings and savings of our people and their investment in another country where they depreciate and lose value incessantly.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to weary the House longer by dealing with many of the other things said by the Taoiseach. I think I am not being unkind to the Taoiseach when I say that the speech he made yesterday was not one of his best speeches.  I think it even failed to impress members of his own side of the House.  He repeated on a couple of occasions one statement which I think was to a certain extent typical of his speech.  He stated that they in &ldquo;Fianna Fáil had always held that the proper way to deal with unemployment was by the provision of employment.&rdquo; Of course, unless we are going to put the unemployed in gas chambers I do not know how else you can deal with unemployment otherwise than by providing employment.  Statements of that kind are just platitudes and do not mean a thing.  We did not have the slightest indication of any principle to deal with unemployment.  We received many indications that the Government denies dislocation has occurred in the relationship between prices and wages and denies even the existence of unemployment. If they will not face up to these questions it is quite impossible to expect them to deal with these questions.  I think this Government never had the support of the people from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  It came into existence, to say the least of it, under most peculiar circumstances and it never had the support of the people since.  It is quite clear that it has not got the support of the people now and that it has lost the support of a large percentage of its own former active supporters.  The last three by-elections, one after another, are the clearest indication of that.  In these circumstances it is indecent and undemocratic for the Government to seek to remain in office.</P>

      <P>It must sound to most Deputies slightly odd to hear the last speaker, the Leader of a political Party, deprecating the existence of what he contemptuously describes as Party politics and boosting the idea of the multi-Party conception of government. <Col N="215" /> Possibly Deputy MacBride might give us an answer to the question: with whom did he intend to coalesce on the occasion of the election in which he put forward over 90 candidates, if 75 or 80 of these candidates were returned?  It seems to me that this idea of the Swiss form of government must be a relatively new idea. We, Independent Deputies&mdash;of course I class myself as one of them&mdash;are in a particularly responsible position at the moment because we in effect, due to an accident, are in the position of being asked to choose between the present Government and an alternative Government. That is in essence what is intended by the vote of confidence put forward by the Taoiseach and naturally it will be the main consequence of our actions when the vote is taken.  I should like to put forward considerations which have weighed with me and which are weighing with me in my approach to the problem, the considerations which will determine the way in which I shall vote when the division is taken.  It is not simply a matter of a vote of confidence or of voting the Fianna Fáil Government out of their present position.  We must consider what Government is likely to replace a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>Consequently before I, at any rate, as a responsible Deputy, cast my vote I must examine to the best of my ability the likely pattern which that alternative form of government will take.  It is quite obvious that it will follow broadly the pattern of the old Coalition Government.  It is quite obvious that it will be largely a coalition of the extreme Right in political life in Ireland&mdash;the extreme Right or the extreme Conservatives as represented by the Fine Gael Party&mdash; and the Left as represented, unfortunately for many of us, by the members of the Labour Party.  Before it is decided to see the end of one Government and before it can easily be accepted that the multi-Party type of government on the lines of the old Coalition Government should be returned, there are some obvious outstanding questions which must be solved.  It is quite futile for leading and senior members of the Fine Gael Party to fling the silly epithets that they have levelled at the Independent Deputies and to describe them as disreputable members of this House. These are not tactics that carry any weight with me.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the British Minister of Food stated in reply to a parliamentary question on Wednesday, 24th June, that he hoped to be in a position to abolish rationing of meat in Great Britain in 1954; and whether he will state what effect, if any, such a development would have on the price schedule for live stock recently agreed with the British Government with special reference to the provision that if any of the products covered by the new annex is returned to private trade, the provisions of the <Col N="226" /> annex will no longer apply to such product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the official records, the British Minister of Food estimated that requirements of ration meat, manufacturing meat and offals in 1954 would total about 2,300,000 tons whereas total supplies in 1953 are not expected to exceed 1,900,000 tons.  The Minister then defined the prerequisites of derationing as follows: adequate supplies spread reasonably over the year; freedom from undue currency restrictions; and satisfactory arrangements for giving effect to the price and market guarantees for home production under the Agriculture Act, 1947.  He expressed his earnest hope that these prerequisites would be satisfied during 1954, but he would not venture to make any firm forecast.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has not, therefore, fully reproduced the statement in question and it cannot be assumed from that statement that meat rationing will be abolished in Britain in 1954.</P>
      <P>Should meat rationing be abolished, however, it would not follow that the price schedule for Irish live stock would be affected.  This could only happen if the British Government were at the same time to hand back the importation or purchase of Irish live stock and meat to private traders. In that event the British Government would be obliged to give prior notice to the Government of Ireland of such handing back to private traders and to discuss future arrangements with us. I have no reason for thinking that such arrangements would be anything but satisfactory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if any product is returned to private trade, the terms of the annex could not be made to apply to it because you would not have bulk purchasing <Col N="227" /> and, therefore, the link between the British price and the price paid for the Irish product could not be well regulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that last night on the B.B.C. Mr. Heald, M.P., reiterated the anticipation and hope of the Minister of Food that meat will be derationed in July 1954?  If these prognostications are fulfilled does not the Parliamentary Secretary think it expedient, at an early date, to give the House some indication of the prices that will obtain for Irish carcase meat in the British market if the basis of equivalence negotiated by me is to go by the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>No firm forecast can be made about derationing taking place in 1954.  In May, at the annual conference of the Federation of Wholesale Freshmeat Traders, the Minister said that even allowing for increased imports and increased home production &ldquo;the most optimistic estimate of total supplies for 1953 would leave us about a quarter of a million tons short of pre-war consumption, and we must not forget that the population has increased by more than 10 per cent. since then.  Taking this increase in population into account, it might be that we are nearer half a million tons than a quarter of a million short of unrationed requirements.&rdquo;  The Minister went on to say that, if they were to deration now, the gap could only be reduced by a significant increase in retail prices.  He pointed out that shortage of supplies was not the only obstacle to the rapid derationing and decontrol of meat.  He mentioned (1), the balance of payments problem; (2), the necessity to work out some arrangements under which the guarantees on prices and assured markets for cattle, sheep and pigs, given to farmers under the Agriculture Act, 1947, could be implemented after decontrol; (3), the termination of the control and operation of slaughterhouses by the Ministry of Food, and (4), the future of the bacon industry. All these prerequisites seem to indicate that it is unlikely decontrol will take place next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was asking whether we should look forward to a period of multi-Party government or to a one-Party Government as at present.  I am not opposed to novelty or new forms of government because I think it is quite right that we should look to every form of government in order to try and work out for ourselves something which would be particularly well suited for dealing with our own peculiar problems.  We have had the advantage of experience of multi-Party government and must be guided in the future by that experience.  I could not understand the reasoning of the last speaker in his suggestion that it would be possible for different political Parties to go forward deliberately at a general election and put forward varying views on the different problems that arise in the course of carrying on government: to put themselves forward as a group anxious to take over the running of the State, and to do that with the deliberate intent, at a later date, of coalescing with a completely different political group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand such a situation arising in certain circumstances in <Col N="229" /> which it would be found necessary to accept the union of political Parties in the national interest, a time of emergency of one kind or another.  But I do not understand the proposition of a Party going forward with the deliberate intent of at a later date coalescing with one or more other Parties.  It seems to me quite obvious that while most of us on both sides of the House would find common ground on a number of the accepted practices of modern government, the necessity for good housing conditions for our people, good social services, good schools, good hospitals and good medical services and things like that&mdash;most of us could agree upon the superstructure of a modern society&mdash;there must be fundamental differences between us on the problems arising out of, say, agriculture.  There could be very important differences between two different Ministers for Agriculture.  Take the broad matters affecting our own country&mdash;beef and tillage.  How could the two sit down around the table and hammer out a policy which would give effect to two completely diverse policies?</P>
    <P>In the same way in relation to finance, how can the two economists, the orthodox economist and the progressive economist, come together and accept one another's policy and agree on a common policy which would give a reactionary and a progressive financial policy?</P>
    <P>This problem has to be faced: if we are to raise the money to build houses, hospitals, schools and the other social amenities required in the modern State, how is that money to be raised? That problem would have to be faced and also the problem of raising money to finance industry&mdash;private enterprise or State investment?  How can those completely diverse views&mdash;completely conflicting views&mdash;on economic policy be reconciled in one Government, in one Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>There are different views on social services.  There is the ultra mundane American Republic type, of old age pensions being molly-coddling, that we should save for our old age, and so on, and that the State should not even provide old age pensions.  You could <Col N="230" /> get that extreme and you could get the other extreme.  How can persons fight an election on those two completely conflicting views and then sit around the table and come to an agreement on some other policy?  There could be no common policy with those two very definite opposing views.</P>
    <P>Take the question of health.  There could be no <i>via media</i> between, say, my views on health and, say, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins' views.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the whole conception of this form of politics is unrealistic.  If we have our views, no matter what they may be, right, centre or left, we should believe in them.  We believe in those views because we feel that if they are implemented they will affect the lives of the community in a way that will react to its benefit and not merely because we think that because we put forward these views we will be returned as a Government or as a Party.</P>
    <P>Again, even in the Deputy's own sphere of activity, the Department of External Affairs, there could be very deeply dividing views on the attitude of, say, this country, as there were in the last war as to whether we should or should not take part in that war. There could be similarly conflicting views in relation to any future war.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I am not impressed by the proposition that that would be a desirable form of Government in a real democracy and that it is one that should recommend itself to our people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy used the phrase that each member of the Government must know what he is talking about.  I do not see that he could honestly say that that condition does not obtain in any form of government. Each Minister must know and is intended to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the general conclusion which the Deputy formed, that people like that form of government because it was there for three years, Fianna Fáil could come back, presumably, with the argument: &ldquo;They liked us for 16 <Col N="231" /> years, consequently they like our form of government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, the most important consideration which I am concerned with is that in this multi-Party type of government&mdash;I know from my own experience&mdash;the pressures are used by each individual group to achieve its own end.  If it has any loyalty whatsoever to the electorate, it must try to redeem the promises it made during the election and, consequently, the Labour Party, if it represents the working man, must try to press to the best of its ability for that which will redound best to the advantage of the working man.  Equally, the Right or the Conservative wing of the multi-Party Government must try to do what it can for the industrialist, the bigger businessman, the wealthy person, the person whom they represent.</P>
    <P>There are two hard straight questions which, if they were answered by one of the inter-Party spokesmen, could help many Deputies.  In relation in the first place to this question of subsidies, there is no doubt at all in the world that the removal of the subsidies inflicted a considerable hardship on many people.  My view on the subsidies at the time was that it was unfortunate that they should be removed. I felt to a certain extent the trade union movement might be able to balance or offset the hardship by an increase in wages in order to meet the increased cost of the essential commodities. It has transpired that the trade unions have not been able quite to meet the very considerable increased costs of these essential commodities and the result is that there are people certainly suffering hardship as a result of the removal of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>Recently, Deputy Kyne, I understand, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, has given us an assurance that he or the Labour Party would insist on the restoration of subsidies if they were to form part of a future Government.  I do not know if that is Labour Party policy or whether it is Deputy Kyne's policy but it does not matter very much.  I would like to know if the <Col N="232" /> Labour Party are prepared to say whether, in their opinion, they would be effective, were they returned to power in a multi-Party Government, in making Fine Gael reintroduce subsidies. When Deputy Kyne made that statement was he committing Deputy Norton and the other shadow Ministers of the Labour Party?  Was he committing the Labour Party.  I honestly believe that the Labour Party would like the subsidies to be restored.  Much more, was he committing Deputy McGilligan as the shadow Minister for Finance?  We must be clear and a simple question can get a simple answer.  Is Fine Gael, as Labour apparently is, committed to restore the subsidies in full or in part?  It might be fairer to say that they were committed to restoring them in part in so far as wages had gone up.  Are Fine Gael committed to restoring the subsidies if they are returned to power in an inter-Party Government?</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that if one part of that Government is committed to such a serious fundamental policy and the other is not you cannot have real government.  Secondly, there is the question of health legislation. The Health Bill is not yet on the Statute Book The Labour Party have given their blessing largely to the Health Bill at present before the House, with the proviso that the Bill does not go far enough.  Fine Gael have been quite unequivocal and unrelenting in their fierce opposition to the passage of that Health Bill. Deputy Costello promised that he would fight every section, every line, every word of it, and he condemned it root and branch.  The Labour Party have supported it.  What is the position then in the proposed shadow Government in relation to health legislation? The Labour Party have expressed one view; Fine Gael have <Col N="233" /> expressed a diametrically opposite view.  Fine Gael are anxious, no doubt, to repeat their effort on the last occasion when they had a Fine Gael Health Minister, Deputy Costello, to restore the Irish Medical Association to the Custom House and give us a Bill which would be in accordance with their will.  In my view, that is a complete negation of democratic usage, a delegation of powers to a nondemocratic group.  That act was carried out by Fine Gael with the connivance of the Labour group in the Government at the time.</P>

      <P>Did the Labour Ministers and Parliamentary Secretary in that Government protest at that time? If they protested and were overborne, what hope have we that a similar position will not arise in the future? Remember that Fine Gael were a comparatively weak group in the inter-Party Government at that time.  They had 31 members and they have now something like 45.  Surely whatever chance there was of Labour controlling and influencing the inter-Party Government or the Fine Gael part of the inter-Party Government then, there seems to be none in the future.  Therefore, as I see it, an inter-Party Government, if they were to come into power, would be one largely dominated by the Fine Gael group in this House, most likely, unfortunately, a greatly strengthened Fine Gael group and, equally unfortunately, with a greatly weakened Labour group.  So that what we would be restoring to power would be a Fine Gael and Labour group with some other constituents of the inter-Party Government.  Before voting, no matter what it may entail or involve, for the restoration of a strong Fine Gael, conservative Government one must bear in mind that the record of Fine Gael since the formation of their Party has been one which has set its face relentlessly and continuously against any real form of social programme any real concern for the under-privileged.</P>

      <P>What has been the record of the Fine Gael Party since they came into the political life of this country?  What were their achievements in social legislation from 1992 to 1932.  (<i>Interruptions.</i>)  What were the advances in catering for the underprivileged and the weaker sections of our society?  After ten years of Government, from 1922 to 1932, the total expenditure on social services was about £3,250,000, slightly less in 1932 than it was in 1922.  There were no widows' and orphans' pensions, no unemployment assistance, no children's allowances.  They were obviously little concerned with the widows and orphans and the unemployed.  That was the record from 1922 to 1932.</P>
      <P>What was the record of Fine Gael from 1948 to 1951?  What did they achieve in the sphere of education? What were their achievements in defence? What was their achievement in justice?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am doing Fine Gael an injustice.  Perhaps they have achieved something and have been particularly shy and not up and coming about it.  The next speaker, if he is a Fine Gael speaker, can tell us what Fine Gael did in the period from 1922 to 1932 in relation to social services and then what the individual Ministers achieved in the period of the inter-Party Government which would justify the people in returning a Fine Gael dominated inter-Party Government. They achieved two things which I can tell them.  Deputy McGilligan achieved the E.S.B. and the beet factory.  Now the total number of people put into industrial employment between 1926 and 1951 was something in the neighbourhood of 159,000 persons. Perhaps the Fine Gael Deputies would tell us how many of those people do they claim credit for, how many industries did they start which would provide employment for how many of those men?  The one point made by Fine Gael is the possibility of a capital investment board.  Do they intend to set up a board which would direct capital investment both private <Col N="237" /> and State?  If they intend to set up such a board they must know it involves interference with the private interests and investments, they must know that it must mean an incursion to a very much greater extent by the State in relation to private business. Do they intend to interfere with the ordinary methods of private investment that we have here in Ireland? That was not so under Marshall Aid. The money was spent as it was taken out by private investors.</P>
      <P>Would Fine Gael insist on the direction of capital investment, the limitation of private investment in a particular way and insist on investment by private investors in order to help the common good rather than in the ordinary way of a private person who is merely interested in using money to make more money.  That is the only proposition I can honestly extract from Fine Gael.  Does Fine Gael intend to control the direction of private investment and increase the scope of Government investment, in that way increasing capital investment generally?  Fine Gael cannot have it both ways, either you will leave private investment as it is, which is investment at a very low rate, or try to make it sufficient to absorb the 60,000 to 70,000 which are chronically unemployed in Ireland.  That is one suggestion thrown up by Fine Gael.  Perhaps one of the Deputies will elaborate on it when they deal with the policy of the Party in regard to health legislation and in relation to subsidies.  As I said, I may have wronged them but I am merely going on their past record and their past achievements.  It seems to me that it would be very unwise for any Deputy, anxious to see social and industrial progress in future years, to bank on Fine Gael changing its spots suddenly and taking on a form which it has not shown in the last 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we must consider the position and the record of the other side, their record between 1932 and 1948, when Exchequer expenditure on social services went up from £3,250,000 to about £11,500,000, when we saw the introduction of widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance, children's allowances, wet <Col N="238" /> time insurance, etc.&mdash;all definite advances in the social legislation of the country.  For some of these advances I think we were probably indebted to the influence of the Labour Party but at the same time that does not take away from the fact that always, during its long run as a Government Party, Fianna Fáil has tended to set its face towards helping the less well-off, the more deserving and the under-privileged.</P>
    <P>Even if you come up to very recent times, we have seen under the present Government the introduction of the Legal Adoption Bill from which the former Government ran away.  We saw the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill.  We have seen the introduction of a definite policy.  We have seen capital development in relation to housing, the provision of schools and so on extended and maintained.  We have seen&mdash;and this is a matter in which I take a personal interest&mdash;the introduction of the Health Bill which is, at any rate, an advance on social legislation in relation to health matters. Again, these are definite achievements on the part of the Government &mdash;not promises but real hard facts as to what was achieved by the present Government even since 1951.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the account, Fianna Fáil must admit that in the last three years there has been a restriction of credit.  Whether that restriction of credit has led to the present high rate of unemployment of between 60,000 and 70,000, with its consequent lamentable emigration, broken homes and families, I do not know.  The cost of living has gone up.  Wages have not kept pace with the rise in the cost of living and there is a definite hardship amongst many poor people in the country at the moment.  There has been a tendency by the Government to indulge in a kind of balance-sheet mentality. I know well it is easy for anyone not in the Government to criticise and to make fun of the problems of the Government.  That is part of the Opposition's job, their duty.  At the same time the balance of trade figures, statistics, balance sheets, debit and credit statements and so on are not read by the mother of a family.  The <Col N="239" /> emigrant or the unemployed man has no interest in them.  It is no consolation to any citizen on whom the cost of living bears oppressively to know that the balance of trade figures are satisfactory.  Again these are more of the hard facts, the truth.</P>
    <P>For the mother who has 5/- to spend, who has to pay 4/2 for a lb. of butter, and then has to buy a loaf of bread and gets a few pence back, I am afraid the balance of trade figures have no interest.  Her husband, who is unemployed, or the members of her family who have to emigrate are not interested in statistics.  They are not interested in whether the balance of our external trade is satisfactory or what the level of our external assets is.  Life for them is too hard, circumstances difficult and even cruel.  The Government will have to come back to a realisation of these facts but I do not think that any other Party has ever been closer, constantly and more consistently closer, to the ordinary man and woman than Fianna Fáil has been.  Certainly they are a Party who have had the interests of the people more at heart over the last 30 years than Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>I think it is important that they should come back again to that position.  It is quite obvious that the results of the two by-elections are very important and furnish a very significant pointer.  Members of the Government are not unintelligent mer and I am quite certain that they will appreciate the significance of these elections.  I do not think there is any doubt but that the people are dissatisfied with the Government's economic policy.  In a demorcracy one must have the support of the people.</P>

      <P>A Government cannot get on without it.  It would be quite wrong however to suggest, I believe, that the people were dissatisfied with the national or industrial policy or the health policy of the present Government. <Col N="240" /> It seems to me that pursuit of a policy on the Fine Gael Benches is a barren pastime and is likely to be a barren pastime.  I wonder if it would be possible for us to get from the Labour leaders what are their intentions should the Government be defeated and if, following a general election, a multi-Party Government should be formed?  Labour has laid it down, at a conference somewhere, that they will not join a multi-Party Government unless they get certain set points accepted as a policy.  Is it possible for Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party or one of his Deputies, to tell us what are these points?  Have they been agreed upon between himself and the Fine Gael Party?  Is Fine Gael agreeable to these points?  How many points are there?  Would they cover social services, health services, an industrial policy, a policy related to agriculture, a policy to end unemployment and stop emigration?  If Fine Gael knows, could Deputy Norton let other Deputies in this House know? This is very vital and important information.  The decision which the House is asked to take to-morrow may affect the life of our country for many years to come.  Certainly it will affect the lives of our people in the years to come.  Surely Deputy Norton could give us some idea of the group of circumstances in which he would be prepared to join in an inter-Party Government. If he will not let the Government, the Opposition or the Independent Deputies know, certainly, as a democrat, it is his duty to let the people of the country know the terms upon which he is prepared to bring his Party into an inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be quite obvious that the policy of the Fine Gael Party has been, quietly and consistently, to absorb the smaller political groups by a series of these forms of inter-Party government&mdash;to absorb one group after the other and gradually to build itself up into a Party large enough to take over complete control.  Without a shadow of doubt, it does not believe in Deputy MacBride's Swiss form of government.  It believes in government by Fine Gael and by nobody else.  The <Col N="241" /> smaller groups, quite obviously, are to be absorbed, one after the other, in so far as they represent any opposition to the Fine Gael policy of complete reaction and stagnation.  Already one small Party has been immolated in order to satisfy the wishes of the conservative Fine Gael Party.  Will Labour also find, in time, that a similar fate faces them?  Remember, it will be too late to cry &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; from inside the belly of the whale when there is no longer a Labour Party.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the problems facing the Government are very serious and very vast indeed. Unemployment, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, stands now between 60,000 and 70,000.  The unfortunate thing about that unemployment figure is that, no matter what Government is in power, it seems to persist between 40,000 and 90,000 as the lowest and the highest figures.  A chronic figure of unemployment is consistently there no matter what Government <Col N="243" /> is in power.  It is not the ordinary seasonal form of unemployment to which Deputy MacBride referred, improving in the summer and then getting worse in the winter.  As the Taoiseach said, there is a hard core of 50,000 to 60,000 unemployed all the time.</P>
      <P>Half a million people emigrated from this country between the years 1926 and 1951.  In spite of that, a consistent figure of 50,000 to 60,000 unemployed has persisted.  Although industrial employment, largely due to the efforts of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Government, has increased by 159,000 since 1926, there has been a reduction of 147,000 in agricultural employment. Therefore, the net increase in employment since 1926 has been only 1 per cent&mdash;12,000 persons.  Whichever Government wishes to take credit for that position is welcome to do so.  That, largely, is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half a million people emigrated between the years 1926 to 1951.  Industrial employment has been offset by the flight from the land.  Under the existing forms of government, jobs turn up at the rate of about 800 a year.  At the moment, in the belief of the T.U.C., we require immediately at least 50,000 jobs.  At present, we are producing jobs at the rate of 800 a year&mdash;that is, one man in every 30 requiring a job can get one under our present system. It is quite obvious that it is a fabulous problem facing this or any other Government.  It seems to me that the problem is one in which there must be a conflict between the views of whether you exist on full employment or whether you accept the continuance of this hard core of unemployed for evermore. Of the total insured population, 12½ per cent. are unemployed at present.  In Great Britain, the figure is 2½ per cent.  We should like to hear from the Government whether it considers that that is a fair assessment of the problem&mdash;not that they should be satisfied with the taking up of employment which will occur in the next few months, the cyclical unemployed to whom Deputy MacBride referred who will be absorbed in the summer months <Col N="244" /> and then facing again high unemployment rates next winter.  Is the Government going to accept this as a continuing feature of our life?  Is the Government going to continue to accept the consequent high emigration of our people, the best of our young people, as a continuing feature in the life of our society?</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that, under the present forms of government, private investment is not providing sufficient employment.  No matter how magnificent have been its achievements, it is not, and, in my view, cannot be expected to make available sufficient capital to provide enough work for the immediate 50,000 jobs required, as put forward by the T.U.C., or the annual 25,000 in the years to come.  Is the Government going to take steps to provide sufficient capital of its own accord to make employment available on the very vast scale required?  It is quite obvious that private investors simply have not got the money, or will not invest the money, or do not wish to risk their money.  Whatever the reasons, they are unimportant but they are not making available the capital to provide the work required for all these men and women.</P>
    <P>We can ignore the problem.  We can put up Government figures to show that unemployment is falling, on the basis of completely fallacious figures, due to the fact that unemployment always falls, or we can face the real problem of a chronic unemployed figure of from 40,000 to 70,000.  The position needs very vigorous handling and obviously needs new methods and a new approach.  No matter how much we may like the existing system or may wish to cling to it, we must be clear on the issue involved.  We must be clear that if we cling to the existing forms of government, if we cling to the existing economic system accepted by us now, the existing economy and the existing financial policies, it is quite obvious that we are also accepting the continued existence as part of our life of high unemployment, varying between 40,000 and 78,000 together with high emigration.  We have tested out the old systems long enough now to know that we can set down as a flat <Col N="245" /> dogmatic assertion that chronic unemployment and chronic emigration will continue, so long as we continue to accept the existing economic system.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, obvious that the Government, if they are not going to accept that&mdash;and I hope they will not accept it&mdash;as necessary or essential in the life of our country, must more and more move into the sphere of capital investment and extend the already magnificent work done by many of the Government companies up to the present in relation to production, transport, air services, shipping, insurance and the many other Government-sponsored enterprises which have done such great work in years past.  There is no reason in the world why private capital should not get every facility, every encouragement and every protection, where protection is desirable and necessary, but, far from private and public expenditure causing congestion, private expenditure and public expenditure are an absolute essential, if sufficient work is to be created to meet the tremendous demands bring made by the people for employment and improvement in the standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently told us that the Government is prepared to accept as the criterion of its success the number of people put into employment.  Broadly, I must say that I would accept that as an excellent promise for the future. Probably nobody in any way has contributed more than the Minister to bring about that reality in the past. It would help many Deputies, however, if we could now be informed as to the Government's decisions in relation to the real problems which are here.  The Opposition have not grossly exaggerated the picture in relation to the cost of living, unemployment or emigration.  Their charges are substantially true.  Their charges, which need not necessarily be answered, are charges, however, which must be met by the production of a scheme by the Government.</P>
    <P>Does the Government intend to provide resources for the considerably increased public capital investment which will be required to provide jobs for the 50,000 unemployed which the T.U.C. say are wanted at once and for <Col N="246" /> the 25,000 unemployed which will be required annually, due to normal population increases in the years ahead?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that is the problem: acceptance of unemployment and emigration, as a continuing feature of our society and our life&mdash;the most regrettable decision that could be taken by anyone&mdash;or, on the other hand, a determination by the Government to face the problem, to get the best brains of the country to bear on the problem and provide a solution for it.  It does not matter really how long the solution takes.</P>
    <P>In my view, the people are well able to stand the hair shirt policy.  Our people are no softer, no weaker and no more lily-livered than any other people in any other nation.  What upsets them is the thought that the hair shirt is put on merely for lack of thought or lack of consideration.  They are prepared to take hardship and hard living if they know that there will be an end to it, if they know that what they are working for to-day is to provide good comfortable living for their children&mdash; for themselves preferably but eventually for their children.  Unfortunately, the Government has created the impression that the hair shirt is here to stay and that is something the people will not tolerate.  I think that the Fianna Fáil Government's record in the past would belie the suggestion that they are disinterested in hardship or in imposing unnecessary hardship on our people.  That is simply not in accordance with their past record but they have got into the position of feeling that the ordinary man-in-the-street or the ordinary woman understands their reading of the situation, their reading of balance sheets, Exchequer returns and statistics as well as they do themselves.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the people do not; the people are not clear as to where the Government is going, in what direction it is going or what it intends to do.  The country owes a tremendous amount, as I have shown, to the present Government in its immediate past and in its more remote past and I am quite certain that, if the people were to understand more clearly what the Government has in mind in its <Col N="247" /> immediate policy and in its long term policy, they would be prepared to give it their full confidence.  There is no reason on any other score, except on economic policy, to reject the present Government because I am hopeful of the undertaking given by the Government, by Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not provoke me further or I may have to say what has been said here already: listening to speeches such as we heard to-day from Deputy Dr. Browne is an occasion of sin for all good Christians.  We can forget the performance of Deputy Dr. Browne and others of that lily-livered ilk because their record on this vote will be decided not in accordance with the interests of the nation but in accordance with self-interest.  Their concern is to prevent at all costs an angry people destroying this Government and every one of its fellow travellers.  That can only be achieved by propping up the unstable foundation of the Taoiseach's present Government and keeping it there despite the will of the people in order that they and their colleagues may retain office and place.  That attitude is contemptible and is so regarded by the people themselves.  I should like to get back to a consideration of the motion before the House. References were made by different Deputies and even by Deputy Dr. Browne to the principles of democracy. I wonder do those who advocate this motion understand what democracy means?  Does it mean that the people must be consulted provided it is in their interests to consult them or does it mean that at all times, no matter what the occasion may be, the right of our people to decide policy and elect a Government must be of paramount consideration?</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to Deputies to remind them that we have a Constitution expressing many provisions that were established on the formation of this State in the blood, sweat and tears that the establishment of that foundation entailed.  Article 6 of our Constitution, which was drafted by the Deputy who moved this motion here yesterday, lays down this solemn principle:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" />&ldquo;All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Article 6 of the Constitution proposed for acceptance by the present Taoiseach as Leader of the country in 1936.  Was that an aphorism?  Was that a vague generality entitled to apply in 1936 but not be valid in 1953?  I want to suggest that that particular principle incorporated in our Constitution and in the Constitution of 1922 was present in our people when they first formed a nation and will always remain as one of the paramount principles of our State that we the people of this country designate and nominate our rulers and that we decide all questions of national policy.</P>
    <P>It is against the background of that Article and of that principle that we now discuss this motion.  This Dáil, elected two years ago, has had a shameful existence.  The rulers nominated by this Dáil were so nominated in the teeth of the people of this country.  On the 30th May, 1951, by more than 100,000 votes, the Irish people decided that they did not want a Fianna Fáil Government in this country and those sent here to translate that will into action met in lobbies and in rooms around this building to nominate a Government in the teeth of the will of the people of this country.  The present rulers of this State are designated by Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan&mdash;a handful of Deputies who do not reflect, and have never reflected in the last two years, the desires and the will of the ordinary people of this country.  That is bad enough.  That is shameful enough, but that is a particular situation that can be set right in God's good time but what about policy?</P>
    <P>Can Deputies remember two short years ago before the present multifeathered Coalition scrambled into office, the statement of policy issued over the signature of the present <Col N="251" /> Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil's 17 points of policy for a new Government?  Do Deputies remember that that programme and that plan contained many provisions but was designed to appeal not to the people&mdash;they did not matter; they had given their decision&mdash;but to the four or five Deputies who would decide who would sit on the right and who would sit on the left of the Ceann Comhairle in this House.  That statement of policy contained in unqualified terms an assurance by the present Taoiseach that a rigid systems of price control would be maintained and that existing food subsidies would be maintained by the new Government.</P>
    <P>Because of that particular promise I have no doubt and I give him honour if honour is due, the Independent Deputy promised his constituents that if elected by them he would focus attention constantly on the cost of living and press for increased subsidies on food and essential commodities. Because of that point and Fianna Fáil's statement of policy of June, 1951, I have no doubt that that Independent Deputy decided that he would vote for Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach and as Leader of the Government in this House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was published to the electorate of South-West Dublin.  That Deputy in his democratic contact with his constituents promised not merely to maintain existing food subsidies but to press that they be substantially increased.  Is it unreasonable to assume that when Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and other Deputies, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne read point 15 of the promise of Deputy de Valera, as he then was, that the Fianna Fáil Government if formed would maintain existing food subsidies and would introduce an efficient system of price control they said: &ldquo;that was in accordance with what we were sent here to do and we <Col N="252" /> will vote for this Government&rdquo;.  I mention that as we are discussing the situation which developed two years later.  The formation of the present Fianna Fáil Government was not in accordance with the will of the people, but let that pass.</P>
      <P>It was formed by a Dáil muster to do a particular job of work, to carry out the 17 points that have been referred to.  Point number one and the main one in the light of present circumstances was to maintain existing food subsidies.  Now two years later that Government puts down a motion, which Deputy Norton very properly described as being like a telegram, that this House reaffirms its confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>Those who never affirmed cannot reaffirm, and the motion is directed to the 74 Deputies who voted for the formation of the present Government. They include the Deputy who has just concluded and who may have given his valedictory message to this House. They include Deputy Cowan who will make his own case.  They also include Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  I do not know what way Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll will vote, or rather I should say that, judging by the facts, there is only one way in which he could vote because, having formed the present Government, its Leader and its Ministers proceeded to depart from the policy they announced to the Deputies of this House two years ago.  They did not maintain the existing food subsidies. On the contrary, they abolished them.  They did not introduce an efficient system of price control.  On the contrary, they decontrolled practically every article of common purchase by our people.  They ignored completely the solemn promises which they had made for the purpose of obtaining the necessary support to form a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, how could those who affirmed confidence two years ago reaffirm it and still remain men?  I have sufficient confidence in the Deputies sent here by the people of this country to believe that, according to their lights, retaining their principles, they will still behave as men.  For that reason, I do not believe <Col N="253" /> that the reaffirmance will be so gladly signed by those who, perhaps in ignorance, did it two years ago.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters because of the question posed by the Taoiseach in tabling this motion to the House. I want to make this point of view clear that here, from these benches on the Chair's right-hand side, we have no doubt that yesterday, to-day and for portion of to-morrow we are wasting the people's time and not doing the country's business.  As regards the arguments advanced by the Taoiseach, and what was urged by the Minister for Lands and the Minister for External Affairs, I suggest that they have no business in saying them here.  Outside the G.P.O., and other parts of the city and country, is the place to make your case for confidence at the present moment.  This House is <i>functus officio.</i> This House has finished its business, and the people outside have declared that they have no confidence whatever in the 14th Dáil, and whether Deputy Brady, or any other Deputy, likes it or not, that is the situation which has developed.</P>
    <P>In a series of by-elections, in a vehement and determined manner, the people of this country decided that they have no confidence in this Dáil. What is the Dáil asked to do in face of that situation?  To say that it is very pleased with itself and to vote confidence in itself, and that in a democracy and in a country whose Constitution declares that the court of final appeal to designate rulers and decide policy shall be the people of Ireland.  There never before in any country has been a more despicable and shame-making performance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in proposing this motion, what is he doing?  Grovelling here on hands and knees for support that he knows he cannot get outside Leinster House.  I think that if we, or any Deputy professing democratic principles, spoke in a manner that was without considerable vehemence on this performance, we would be doing very serious harm to our institutions. We all know, it cannot be concealed and the people have not failed to note it, that this entire stunt&mdash;and it is nothing but a stunt&mdash;this entire gospel <Col N="254" /> of convenience bethought of ten days ago when the election results came in from Cork and Wicklow, has deceived no one.  With the tide flowing strongly and determinedly against Fianna Fáil, with the boat beginning to sink the planks have to be thrown from it.  One plank will be grasped, I have no doubt, by Deputy Cowan and others will grasp their planks.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not worry about the Labour Party.  The Labour Party will come back, if I am a prophet, at least twice as strong in three weeks' time, and they will take one seat in North-East Dublin.  We know that this stunt was decided upon for a particular petty political purpose. I am sure that the most unwilling actor in this performance has been, and is, the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach has played for over 30 years an important and commanding part in our political life.  At one time he was the acknowledged and respected leader of our organised efforts prior to the formation of the State, and, in the years that followed, throughout them and despite them, he remained the leader of a large and important political organisation. When, 26 years ago, he and his Party entered this House they came in as gospellers of the will of the people of this country.  In speech after speech, in year after year and in election after election, the Taoiseach has preached the importance at all times of consulting the people of this country.  In the period from 1933 to 1948, a period of 15 years, the Taoiseach six times, by way of general election, went to the people of Ireland.  A sparrow merely had to twitt to suggest that the Taoiseach had not a mandate and, hell for leather, he went to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the member of this House, and that is the political leader who is compelled now&mdash;I have no doubt against his wishes by those who would suffer in a general election&mdash;to put down this motion and to deny the people the opportunity they are entitled to under Article 6 of the Constitution to designate their own <Col N="255" /> rulers and decide their own policy. Many statements made by the present Taoiseach have already been quoted. I do not propose to repeat them but I would like to remind Deputies who were members of the last Dáil when the present Taoiseach was Leader of the Opposition, that the inter-Party Government was only 15 or 16 months in office when by means&mdash;to use Deputy Cowan's expression&mdash;of a snap division a motion to refer back an Estimate not of major importance&mdash; the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;was carried by the then Opposition.  There were Deputies at that time, such as Deputy Cowan and others, indeed myself, who did not anticipate that a division would be held on that particular Estimate.  However, it was held and the Opposition carried it.</P>

      <P>The following morning that Estimate was again proposed and Deputies were asked to decide as a matter approaching confidence as to whether or not that Estimate should be passed.  There was then criticism from the present Taoiseach, as Deputy de Valera, as to whether that was or was not the correct way of setting about the business.  He referred to previous occasions, what the previous leaders of Government had done.  He said that Mr. Cosgrave, as President of the Executive Council, had put down on one previous occasion a major vote of confidence as a result of being beaten in the House.  That was one way of doing it.  At column 461, Volume <Col N="256" /> 117, of the Official Debates of 8th July, 1949, the Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another course was open to the Taoiseach and the Government, if they desired to take it, which in my opinion would have been the proper way of dealing with it, and that was to go to the President and ask for a dissolution.  . . . I did it on every occasion on which we were defeated. We went and sought a dissolution. . . . We were proved to have been right.  We did not want to be in office on sufferance.  We wanted to be in a position in which we would be able to do the work of the country properly and be able to say that we were the Government by the declared will of the people, tested in the most democratic way; that when we spoke we spoke for the country as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The next sentence that the Taoiseach used was: &ldquo;That is not the position to-day&rdquo;.  I think that is a fair description of the present situation.  That is not the position to-day.  How can the Taoiseach who, as Leader of the Opposition in the last Dáil, expressed those courageous sentiments, that he would not be the leader of a Government maintained on sufferance, that even in a snap division in the Dáil, he would go to consult the people of Ireland, propose a motion to cheat the Irish people of a right to say whether or not they want his Government or desire his policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same debate and on the same occasion the Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, who is strangely absent from this debate, also had some important observations to make.  It is interesting to recall that when this motion was discussed on the 8th April, 1949, the House had just completed two by-elections.  One by-election was in Donegal; the other was in West Cork.  Deputy Cowan will remember that, as he spoke against Fianna Fáil in those days.  Those two by-elections had just been decided by the people. Donegal failed to elect the inter-Party candidate and Fianna Fáil won that seat.  West Cork, due to the assistance of Deputy Cowan, I have no doubt, showed rather decisively that they <Col N="257" /> wanted the Labour candidate, then Deputy Murphy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can claim for the Labour candidate.  You did not find me in Donegal.  There is no Labour candidate there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We know you.  In those two by-elections the then Government won one and lost one, but there was a slight increase in the Fianna Fáil vote in West Cork and it gave tremendous confidence to certain Fianna Fáil Deputies, particularly to Deputy MacEntee, as he then was. When the Taoiseach had concluded his observations on that debate in came the knight in shining armour, Deputy MacEntee, to have another tilt at the Government.  Here is what Deputy MacEntee had to say, and I hope Deputy Cowan will remember it because Deputy MacEntee at that time used to say a lot of things to Deputy Cowan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At column 468 of the same volume the Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have heard a great deal about West Cork and we have heard, I should say, a little about West Cork, but we have heard nothing about East Donegal.  However, West Cork gave as little consolation to this Government as East Donegal did.  These gentlemen have learned the lesson of West Cork and they are afraid that what East Donegal and West Cork did in the two by-elections which have taken place in the short time they have been in office, the people of Ireland would do in an even more emphatic way to-morrow, repudiate this Taoiseach and every element in that Coalition. That is why he is able to rally behind him to-day in the Dáil the Deputies who do not care about democracy and who are prepared to put their places above their principles.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could any description be more apt to emphasise the situation now confronting <Col N="258" /> this House?  Who now rallies behind him the Deputies who are prepared to put their places before their principles?  Who now is fearful of the Irish people?  Who now throws democratic principles to the winds, fearful of what would be decided by the people to-morrow?  The very Party on whose behalf those boastful sentiments were expressed on the 8th July, 1949, comes in here as a political beggarman looking for votes for a motion of confidence. Circumstances such as these undoubtedly call for a strong and vehement protest.  I do not think it is possible for anyone who opposes this motion to do so in a restrained manner and certainly if I had spoken 20 minutes earlier, having listened to the nonsense uttered by Deputy Dr. Browne, you, Sir, would have had occasion to restrain me very violently. The position that now obtains is that we on this side of the House speak for the people of Ireland.  We represent the Irish people.  The Taoiseach laughs.  Bring his laugh down to Clare.</P>

They do not represent the people.  They were not put there by the people.  In four out of six by-elections the people have decided that they want to get rid of them.  Were it possible, under our Constitution, to serve a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> on that Government, it would be done.  Their only right or title to be there is the right or title given under the Constitution by the people.

      <P>Who decided the policy of abolishing food subsidies? Who decided the policy of restricting credit?  Who decided the policy of lending money to Britain?  Who decided all that has been done in the last two years?  Was it the people of Ireland? Was it the people who are clamouring and clamant at the gates of Leinster House now looking for jobs? Were those the people who freely decided that the lb. of butter should go to 4/2, that sugar, tea and bread should cost more?  Were they the people who decided that it would be an offence to purchase Irish creamery butter in this city or in the town of Bray?  Who decided that policy?  Do not we all know that in so far as the Deputies on the left of the Chair had any responsibility for that policy two years ago, they were told that that Government would maintain existing food subsidies and control prices?  Who brought about the change?  Who was consulted?  Was Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll consulted?  Was Deputy Cowan consulted?  If not, by what right is that policy now in operation and, <i>a fortiori</i>, by what right do those who implement that policy propose to continue when the people of Dublin, Cork, Wicklow, Limerick, the majority of the people of Waterford, the majority of the people of Mayo, decisively decided that they did not want that kind of policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is the court of final appeal?  Is not it Deputy Cowan?  Is not it Deputy Cogan?  Is not it the two or three Deputies to whom this motion is directed, whom the Taoiseach or those behind the Taoiseach, hope to gather into the net of Deputies who will put their place before principles?  Is it not <Col N="261" /> they, these two or three, who are now deciding the policy that this country and this Government are following?</P>
    <P>I think that very serious harm will come to our democratic institutions if this sorry story reaches the end designated by the Taoiseach.  I hope that the good sense of democrats in this House will not allow the final chapter to be put to the book as the Taoiseach hopes and that to-morrow the good sense of Deputies here will remind the Taoiseach of what he has urged and what his Ministers have urged are proper to be put before the people of this land and that he has no business coming in here expecting a chorus of &ldquo;ayes&rdquo; to his own &ldquo;aye&rdquo; because that is asking this House to do something which is no concern of this House.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I think Deputies should remember.  What is the concern for the continuance of this Government in office?  Why is it so necessary for them to remain in office?  What right have they to say that their policy is best for the people and that the people have no right to think otherwise?  Is that our domocracy?  It may be correct.  Their policy may be the best, the results to flow from it, the jam which is always to-morrow may some day be jam to-day. But let the people so decide.  I cannot believe, however, that the concern that is asserted and that compelled the Taoiseach to propose this motion, as I believe, against his own better feeling, is a concern also of material self-interest, a concern to maintain this Government in office for three years to qualify two Ministers and several Parliamentary Secretaries for pensions.</P>

But who will gain and who will benefit?  By what authority will they be there?  If this motion is carried and this Dáil rises on the 31st of this month until next November and some matter of importance to our people arises, has the Taoiseach any right to speak for the Irish people?  Has any member of his Government any right to speak for the Irish people without a Parliament in session, without our people's representatives together?

      <P>I think, Sir, I have spoken at an undue length on this motion.  This week will be a black week in our parliamentary history. Never before was the Leader of any Government in the unenviable position that the present Taoiseach finds himself in.  Never before have so many words had to be eaten as he has to eat.  Never before have the vaunted phrases of the past been swept away by the cold breeze of a general election, and that is the situation that confronts us now.  It is in these circumstances that we on this side of the House say that we speak for the majority of the people of this country, that the Government have no right to be there, that so long as they remain there they do so in defiance of our people and that sooner or later our people will arise in an angry tumult to sweep them and their fellow-travellers from office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>One gets a certain amount of amusement listening to a speech such as Deputy O'Higgins has just delivered.  In that speech he referred to this motion as a stunt, and I understand that in using that phrase, that term, he had followed other Deputies on his side of the House. Now it is common knowledge, or at least it is the general belief, that if this motion was not before the House there would have been another motion before the House, and that is a motion to the direct opposite&mdash;that this House had lost confidence in the Government. The only difference between the Taoiseach's motion and that other motion is this: that the Taoiseach was enabled to put it down by his own decision, while the other motion had to go through the staff work of the four or five leaders that are alleged to be the inter-Party grouping in this House. In politics we have stunts.  It is quite a common thing to have them; and the Taoiseach was quicker than they were.  He knew that he should get his motion in first because if he did not put it down the others would put one <Col N="264" /> down.  They would be queer politicians, after their shouting about Cork and Wicklow, if they did not put down a motion that this House had lost confidence in the Government.  A lot of the bitterness of the debate is due to the fact that in this small little matter of the approach to a motion of this kind they were outwitted.</P>
      <P>Now this should have given rise to an important debate.  I looked forward to an important debate.  Deputy Costello spoke first for the Opposition. His position in the House is somewhat difficult to understand, but I take it that because he spoke first he still claims to be Leader of the Opposition, that he leads for the Clann na Talmhan Party, that he leads for Fine Gael although he is not the Leader of Fine Gael, that he leads for the Labour Party, and that he leads for Alderman Byrne and his son in Dublin NorthWest.</P>

      <P>Anyway, Deputy Costello started off with his first gibe, about hospital corridors.  That reference must have offended and nauseated even the members of his own Front Bench sitting beside him.  After all, when he was trying to become the Taoiseach in 1951, he brought the stretcher into this House for the purpose of trying to secure a majority.  Now he talks about this House, when the vote is taken, being likened to a hospital corridor.  I admire the sense of responsibility and courage that is in a Deputy who leaves a sick bed and comes here to carry out his responsibility to his constituents and to his country&mdash;no matter what Party he belongs to.  It was unworthy of Deputy Costello to make such a gibe at Deputies who are so interested in their public affairs as to leave their sick beds and come into this House to vote. Certainly, it was an unworthy reference to the Deputy whom he brought here on a stretcher, or who came himself on a stretcher, for the purpose of supporting Deputy Costello in 1951.  Illness is no respecter of politicians and illness may hit Deputies on all sides of the House.  Illness is just as likely to affect Deputies sitting on Deputy Costello's side as it is to affect Deputies on this side.  Those behind Deputy Costello who were smiling and were amused at this particular reference might ponder and consider the implications of the gibe.  An irresponsible back bencher might make a comment of that kind, but coming from a person who was honoured by this House by being appointed as Taoiseach and who carried on as Taoiseach for three years it was a very steep fall indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions during his speech, Deputy Costello referred to myself and to other Independent Deputies who generally support the <Col N="267" /> Government as &ldquo;disreputable&rdquo; Deputies. That, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in my view was not the language of Parliament but the language of the fish market.  It is regrettable and to be deplored that language like that should be used by anybody in this House and particularly by a former Taoiseach.  Obviously, the phrase was not a parliamentary phrase, a phrase that would be permitted by the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle; but Deputy Costello availed of the opportunity given him by a temporary and inexperienced Chairman, to make use of that expression on several occasions in regard to five or six Deputies here who do not belong to any of the big or the small political Parties.</P>
    <P>What have I done?  What has any of the other named Deputies done&mdash; Deputy Browne, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll or Deputy Cogan?  What have we done that entitles any other Deputy to refer to us as &ldquo;disreputable&rdquo; Deputies?  Our crime is simply this, that in 1951, when it came to the election of a Taoiseach, we voted for the present Taoiseach.  As far as I am concerned, and I think as far as the other named Deputies are concerned, we have consistently supported the present Taoiseach and the present Government since then.  Is that sufficient ground to describe me or them as &ldquo;disreputable&rdquo; Deputies?  Politics are certainly coming to a very low ebb when intimidation of that kind can be attempted even in the House of Parliament, that if we do not vote at their dictation then we are disreputable characters and disreputable Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello should not forget that before the election of the Taoiseach in 1951, he did everything in his power to get myself and the other named Deputies to vote for him as Taoiseach.  We were not disreputable Deputies then.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello is very fond, when Deputy MacBride or somebody else provides him with the reference, of quoting constitutional practice.  During the course of the debate, he quoted from a volume some matters of constitutional practice. That came very well from Deputy Costello, who was unable, when he was Taoiseach, to control the Government of which he was in charge in accordance with the terms of the Constitution. Under the Constitution of this country, the Government acts as a united body.  Under the Constitution, members of the Government are nominated by the Taoiseach, approved by this House and sanctioned by the President.  But it is the Taoiseach who appoints his Ministers.  He appoints all his Ministers, the Minister for Health, the Minister for External <Col N="270" /> Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture, etc.  That is the constitutional position. But, during Deputy Costello's régime, we had this invasion of our constitutional rights: that one of his Ministers, the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, sends a letter to the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, instructing him to resign from the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>We could carry on our debates very quietly until Deputy Dillon came in; there was no trouble. Deputy Costello was quoting constitutional practice during this debate.  As far as I am concerned, under the Constitutional of this country I have the constitutional right to use my vote in this House in the way I think it ought to be used and nobody, whether he is an ex-Taoiseach or anybody else, will be permitted to refer to my action in doing that as disreputable conduct. &ldquo;Disreputable&rdquo; is a hard word, and if I were to deal with it in the way I ought to by examples of what I considered to be disreputable behaviour during the period of office of the last Government, disreputable behaviour on the part of the then Taoiseach, certain people would, perhaps, be offended.  I do not propose to do that now, but I warn Deputy Costello that if there are any more references by him to disreputable conduct on my part then I will accept the challenge and there are certain matters upon which I will throw the spotlight of publicity in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Please keep your <Col N="272" /> mouth shut.  I am sorry to speak in such an offensive way.  Waterford was won by the Government; Limerick was lost by the Government; in Dublin North-West there was no change; in Mayo there was no change; Wicklow was lost by the Government; in East Cork there was no change.  In three of these six by-elections there was no change.  In two of them the Government lost a seat and in one they won a seat.  The net result of the six by-elections is that the Government lost one seat.  Anybody can put any other construction on it he likes as far as this House is concerned, but the net result of the six by-elections is that the Government have one seat less than they had when elected to office in 1951. Where is the change that has been talked about?  Where is the demand for the Government to declare a general election and get out?</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that under our system of proportional representation in three-seat constituencies if a vacancy occurs through death or otherwise, the Party that held two out of the three seats will win.  The Party which can elect two to one in a general election must win the seat, and it is, therefore, a fortuitous circumstance as to where a by-election takes place.  If it takes place in an area in which the Government have two seats out of three, they will win.</P>

      <P>I know it is all right for Deputy Dillon and those other Deputies with him who hanker so much after office to try and read into election results that the country is swinging in their favour. Deputy Dillon knows that is not so, but the idea is: &ldquo;If we can have a general election perhaps we might win.  Perhaps we may remain as we are but there is no harm in trying.&rdquo; His is not the responsibility, and it is always the position of a Party in opposition to demand an election every time they can.  In Britain, they have had elections in the last five years during the period when the Labour Government was holding on, and it did hold on by a very small majority.  The Conservative Government, by a small majority, is now holding on to office in England and both those Governments during their periods in office lost elections and, of course, in each case the Opposition demanded as a matter of policy&mdash;I think it is more as a matter of form, but nobody bothers about it one way or another&mdash;a general election.</P>

One of the things which creates instability and has been deliberately carried on to create instability for the past couple of years has been the work of certain journalists who have nothing else to do but talk about the possibilities of a general election.  We were all primed up by independent newspapers that we were definitely going to have an election on the Civil Service award.  The Government were going to be beaten and there would be an election on this.  No doubt about it.  The vote was taken; the Government won by perhaps its biggest majority, and I took up the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on the following Sunday and read headlined there: &ldquo;Opposition Escaped Trap.&rdquo;  In other words, they left their members at home or sent some of them out into the city so that they could not possibly win. And then, they talk about a general election!  There was their chance to show whether they wanted a general election, but they preferred to play a big fraud on the civil servants. They wanted no general election.</P>

      <P>This conduct of Deputy Dillon's is what they call whistling going by the graveyard trying to keep up one's spirits.  I want to say that the most regrettable feature, to me anyway, of these last two by-elections has been the tendency to the elimination or disappearance of the Labour Party.  Take both constituencies. In East Cork, which was a Labour seat&mdash;an old colleague of ours, the late lamented Deputy Seán Keane held that seat for Labour&mdash;one would have thought that the Labour candidate might have been allowed to fight for that seat himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The result of the election was that Labour lost the seat in that constituency.  I know the Labour Party are giving consideration to that problem.  Certainly the rank and file members of the Party in the City of Dublin are giving considerable consideration to it.  It did look to me extraordinary that, at a time when the Health Bill was being piloted through this House, when the Fine Gael Party were opposing that social measure and the Labour Party were supporting it, as they say, for what it is worth, we can find in that constituency two Parties, one against social development&mdash;the Fine Gael Party&mdash;and the other for it&mdash;the Labour Party&mdash;combining together to try to defeat the candidate of the Party putting forward the measure.  There is something extraordinary in that situation and it <Col N="277" /> is a situation that will have to be cleared up.  As I say, a position like that must receive, and is, I am perfectly certain, receiving, the consideration of the Labour Party, but if we are going to have that situation every time there is a vacancy in which a Labour Party candidate is concerned, it would mean the eventual disappearance from this House of the Labour Party.  I do not mind Deputy Desmond saying to me across the House, as he is entitled to say, that I shall be defeated in the next election.</P>

      <P>I want to say this because at least I know a little about the constituency I represent.  I know nothing about Deputy Desmond's constituency. I want to put it to him that it would not matter very much&mdash;it would matter nothing as far as political Parties are concerned&mdash;whether an Independent Deputy goes out or not, but it would matter an awful lot if, in the peculiar situation we have, a Party that has contributed so much as the Labour Party has over the last 30 years to the Government of this country, should in the peculiar situation we have, go to the wall.  Deputy Desmond, I understand from people from Cork who speak to me, is much more advanced and progressive in his expressions in Cork than he is in this House.  Therefore it is difficult just to know exactly where one stands with him.  What I do want him to realise is that he has a big responsibility.  So have Deputy Corish, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Hickey.  They have a big responsibility to save the Labour Party.  Those Deputies will recollect that when I went into the Division Lobby in 1951 to vote for the present Taoiseach I said I was doing it deliberately to try to break the alliance between the Labour Party and Fine Gael which would lead to the destruction of the Labour Party.</P>

What the Labour Party want&mdash;I am talking about the rank and file of the Party&mdash;is to try to improve social services.  The Labour Party does not want a general election.  Supposing a general election resulted in the way that Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Costello say it would result, what would be the end of that?  The disappearance of the Labour Party or at least the loss of some seats by that Party.  I do not think that Labour can afford to lose any seats.</P>

There is serious work to be done in this country, very serious work, <Col N="279" /> and it is because of the seriousness of the work that has to be done that since the day I voted for the Taoiseach I have on every occasion consistently, even on measures with which I was not in full agreement with them, supported this Government.  Why?  Because I think it is necessary, if we are going to make progress, that there must be some stability.  I have endeavoured by my vote over these two years deliberately to create that stability.  The Government have never discussed any measure with me.</P>

I only want to say, on that aspect, that I have deliberately endeavoured to create a condition of stability over the past two years by voting solidly and consistently to maintain the present Government in office.  I have done that because of the problems, such as unemployment, that are there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="280" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a minute.  The cost of living is a problem.  As far as I am concerned, the real problem is unemployment.  I do not want to see, on the streets of this city, 9,000, 10,000 or 20,000 young men parading and clamouring for work when work could be found.  Deputy Hickey will agree with me that there is no difficulty about money&mdash;at least, we have always agreed that there is none.  There is no difficulty about constructive works: the constructive works are there to be done.  Now, who is going to make the most genuine effort to solve that unemployment problem&mdash;to create, as the Taoiseach said, new industries?  He said that it has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil to create new industries so as to establish the unemployed in permanent employment.  I agree with that.</P>
      <P>Everybody will agree with it.  But there is a condition in between.  To carry out any constructive works of major importance, or to create major industries that will give employment, takes a long, long time.  To create public works, even of major importance, takes a long time.  The trouble is that while these plans are being prepared, and all the machinery set up, there will be hardship and hunger in many homes in this city and through the country.  What I am asking the Taoiseach to say when he is closing this debate is that the Government realise that fact and that, side by side with their policy of creating new industries that will give continual and permanent employment, the Government will set up some committee of Ministers, Deputies or anybody it likes &mdash;it does not matter who they are&mdash;to put into employment as many people as can speedily be put into employment. In that way, the Government will get a grip immediately on an unemployment situation that is serious. I am certain that Deputy Hickey and Deputy Larkin would much prefer to be supporting the Government in doing that than to be talking about a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to it for the past two days.  It is awful.  Now that we are down to the reality of the situation, let us deal with it.  In Dublin City we want to build corporation buildings.  It will cost some millions of pounds to build them.  I was appointed a member of a sub-committee that got down to deal with that problem.  Every time we suggested a site, our engineers said: &ldquo;No.  You cannot build there.&rdquo;  What did they want to do?  Instead of building these new corporation headquarters and buildings that are necessary in a place where we have the sites, they say: &ldquo;No.  You must knock down half the city, at a cost of about £20,000,000, and when you have that done you can start to build.&rdquo;  In other words, we have to go through all the processes of compulsory acquisition of that property, which will take at least 20 years; then we are to have a competition for designs and then, in another 20 years, somebody will start to build.  That is no good.  We have to do it at once.</P>
      <P>The Government also have a scheme in regard to their Government Buildings and a new Parliament House.  We want the castle.  A Cheann Comhairle, might I be protected from Deputy Dillon's observations which I can hear but which you cannot hear?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least Deputy Dillon might have the courtesy not to engage in a conversation.  His whole purpose is to interfere with the submissions which I am making to the House.  The Government have had <Col N="282" /> plans and ideas of building a new Parliament House and of reconstructing the castle.  That is work that is necessary to be done.  This generation, in the past 30 years, has done very little in the matter of public buildings. In fact, our record in regard to public buildings since we got our freedom in 1922 has been a pretty bad record: that is, for major public buildings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey will agree with me that, in this generation, we want to build works of national importance and works that will give employment. Recently I was looking at developments in other cities and I could see the plan which had been worked out over the past 50 years.  I could see that those cities were enlarged and beautified because there was imagination behind the work.  But what do we meet here?  When we want to build, as we wanted to build, a big road out to Bray&mdash;which would give a lot of employment &mdash;we had the <i>Irish Independent</i> and a lot of Fine Gael hangers-on condemning the scheme and eventually stopping it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next thing we must do is to get this plan of public works going right away.  The Government can do that either by a committee of Deputies, a committee of civil servants or even by the appointment of some special person charged with the responsibility of getting these works carried out.  If we can put men into employment immediately on that sort of work&mdash;in constructive work&mdash;there will be a fillip to employment over the city.  The man engaged on the constructive work and able to earn a decent wage will spend his money in the shops buying clothes, boots and other articles which he could not otherwise afford.  In that way he will indirectly <Col N="283" /> give employment to a number of other people.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Government had to take the steps they took, and have been taking for the past two years, to establish confidence in the State.  Now that that has been done, the Government must face this problem of the 50,000 or the 60,000 unemployed and they must deal with it in the way they dealt with an emergency situation during the last war.  The Taoiseach will give hope to the people and hope to the country if, when he is concluding this debate, he is able to say: &ldquo;Yes. We will deal, or attempt to deal, in so far as we can, with this unemployment crisis in an emergency manner for two or three years, until such time as we are able to get our plans for major industry going.&rdquo; I am putting it to the Taoiseach that what this country wants is a sincere effort to get work done. We could spend, not merely three days on this debate but three years.  Unfortunately, we have been spending a lot of time debating matters in this House while what we require is more confidence in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The plain people of this country will be confident and will give their support when they realise that necessary steps are being taken in the public interest.  Other matters have been mentioned, but I do not intend to go into them, because &mdash;taking my cue from Deputy Hickey &mdash;many things have been said in the course of the debate which might perhaps have better been left unsaid. I did propose to deal with certain people outside the House, people who availed of every opportunity to bring the House and Parliament into disrepute; but where we are debating a motion of confidence put down, as this has been put down, by the Taoiseach, in which he asks the House to re-affirm its confidence in the Government, we can deal with the practical problems of employment and unemployment. Deputy Dr. Browne gave the statistics with regard to agricultural employment <Col N="284" />&mdash;a reduction of about 145,000 in the period of a quarter of a century or so. That is serious, but there are more serious problems still in connection with agriculture.  I say that the development of machinery on the land&mdash;Deputy Dillon, I know, does not agree with this&mdash;has to a large extent been responsible for unemployment on the land.</P>

      <P>Here is our problem. We are either discussing this subject or we are not.  This House, perhaps, would much prefer if we abused one another rather than talked practical matters.  Looking at the fields of this country and at the waste land in the country, we can produce at least 100 per cent. more than we are producing from our land, and we want to do that. What I want to get is a practical policy that will be carried out by the Government to bring about the situation in which there will be a 100 per cent. increase in production on our farms.  We owe that, not only to ourselves, but to the human race, because, according to statistics, there will be a shortage of food in a very short time.</P>

      <P>Because the population is growing so big in relation to the amount of food available, there will be a shortage, and I think it is our duty in Ireland to do our best to help in the solution of the food problem of the world.  In that regard, I want to make only one statement.  I was discussing recently with some British M.P.s the matter of butter.  They told me&mdash;and I am glad to have the opportunity of mentioning it here although it is probably known to Deputies&mdash; that in a very short time they would not require in England to buy any butter at all.  The market will be supplied by a margarine which includes all the nutriments and all the value of the best butter.</P>

We could also <Col N="287" /> say at this stage, regrettably, that the person responsible for this whole debate, the person responsible for the play-acting of Deputy Cowan, who laughed his fill at Deputy Cowan and enjoyed so much the clowning of Deputy Cowan, the Taoiseach himself, has also gone.</P>

      <P>We have been here all the time, too.  To me, this motion is something of much greater importance than it is apparently to those members who laughed so heartily and enjoyed so much the attitude adopted by Deputy Cowan, a Deputy for the City of Dublin, where at present there are thousands of unemployed showing by their attitude openly in the city that they want work.  The Taoiseach is asking for a vote of confidence, and, in order to help him to get that vote of confidence apparently, Deputy Cowan has suggested what should be done. We have heard on frequent occasions about plans.  It is a very familiar word in this Chamber&mdash;the plans that are available and being made available; I say that the only hope apparently that the present Government has now is if they provide Deputy Cowan with a new set of plans, plans for which he asked here this evening.  Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne are Independent Deputies and entitled to act as they wish.  They have been members of this House for the past two years; did they ever inquire during those two years about the plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Labour Party take this vote in a very serious mood. It is certainly no help to us to listen to some of the speeches here, including the two and a half hour speech contributed by none other than a Minister of State, the Minister for External Affairs.  Instead of putting the case of the Government asking for a vote of confidence, he found this a suitable opportunity on which to lecture us on the past position and on the position that obtains at present through the medium of the Constitution of the United States of America <Col N="288" /> and of Great Britain.  He took the opportunity of telling us about the small majorities that Governments have in other countries.  Surely, as a Minister of State, he should have devoted that time towards putting the case for the Government's request for a vote of confidence at this juncture. Will anyone suggest that the Minister for External Affairs could by his contribution here to-day win over the support of any Independent Deputy, provided that Independent Deputy is sincerely looking for information and guidance on this important issue?</P>
    <P>I will not badger any member of this House as to the way in which he should vote.  It is immaterial to me. I know the way I will vote.  I know the way my Party will vote.  Others can answer for themselves.  We had Deputy Dr. Browne's inquisitive mind brought to bear on the issue this evening. We heard him, sincerely, I believe, plead for the people who find it so hard to exist at the present time. He asked for certain information from Deputy Norton, Leader of the Labour Party.  Apparently he was anxious to get that information.  Strange as it may seem, without waiting for that information to be given, he finished his speech by saying that he was voting for the Government.  What information does Deputy Dr. Browne want?  He has made up his mind.  He made his up long before this.  He made it up when he voted for the removal of the food subsidies, and when he voted for the present Health Bill, a Bill which is nothing in comparison with the measure&mdash;and I give him credit for it&mdash;that he envisaged when he was Minister for Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not get it. Now he is taking the advice of Fianna Fáil, and he will never get it.  Deputy Kyne made it clear to-day that he was speaking for the Labour Party. With the help of Providence, should a General Election come this Party will not be small in number, though that is the suggestion made by both Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne.  The Minister for Finance, too, is worrying about the size of the Labour Party. <Col N="289" /> The Labour Party will prove by its actions that it means what it says in contradistinction to the dual-sided statements made by responsible members of the present Government in by gone years.  The Labour Party knows where it stands.  The Government and Fianna Fáil know where Labour stands. They know where Labour stood in 1932 and, were it not for Labour then, they would not be there to-day on that side of the House.  Labour supported them in 1932.  We are not sorry we supported them then because we believed at the time that Fianna Fáil intended to fulfil all the promises they had made to the utmost of their ability.</P>
      <P>We hear a good deal about Communism, Nazism and Titoism.  We have an &ldquo;ism&rdquo; here.  The last ten or 12 years of Fianna Fáil Administration prior to 1948 showed a definite outlook and approach as far as the workers are concerned, namely, &ldquo;Devism.&rdquo; Do not forget that during the war period the Fianna Fáil Government brought in the Standstill Wages Order.  Do not forget that in yesterday evening's papers we saw further evidence of class distinction: a private in the Army will in future get an increase of 6d. per day while a major will get an increase of 2/3.  How could Labour in those circumstances be expected to support this vote of confidence?  Whether or not this vote of confidence will be secured, it will not remedy the situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated recently that it is not beneficial to the welfare of the community to have elections at short intervals. Normally, I would agree that that is true because it would be more beneficial for the country and the community if a Government is able to remain in office for the full term.  The situation to-day is that after two years in office&mdash;to say nothing of the 15 or 16 years from 1932 to 1948&mdash; the Government are still at the stage of preparing plans.  We know in our hearts that such a Government will never be in a position to implement even in five years the programme Labour hold the country demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned the desirability, as did a certain Minister of State, of going on with plans for public <Col N="290" /> buildings.  According to the Press report this morning the Taoiseach, speaking on housing, maintained it was essential there should be a true balance held between the provision of housing and the productive capacities of the State.  I say to Deputy Cowan and to all members of the Government Party that their obligation is, first and foremost, to see that the people in rural Ireland are decently housed before we start speaking of public buildings or any other such grandiose schemes.  That should be our approach if we believe in the Christian concept of life.  Deputy Cowan mentioned the problem of housing in Dublin.  We know what happened a few years ago when we had Deputy Tadhg Murphy, God be good to his soul, as Minister for Local Government.  At that time there was no question of an engineer or an architect offering objections to plans.  At that time the red tape was snipped and the Labour Party approach permeated the Department of Local Government.  At the present time, however, because of the support of Deputy Cowan and of others like him of a Government which has increased the rate of interest to be paid for money, the building of houses has been adversely affected.  At the present time there is undoubtedly a slowing-up in the building of houses in this country.</P>
    <P>Are we supposed to forget that?  Are we expected to agree with the Taoiseach when he asks for a vote of confidence?  Are we going to face our responsibilities to the people who placed us here?  In his speech Deputy Cowan appears to have made some reference to Cork.  He was worried apparently in regard to the future outlook of the Labour Party.  I would say to Deputy Cowan that I was lucky enough, thank God, to get sufficient votes to get in here without difficulty. We must be prepared to accept the outspoken opinion of the people in rural Ireland.  I am not speaking from any prepared notes nor am I dwelling upon any of the statements made here during the past three years or 30 years. What I am saying is only a reiteration of what the people in South Cork are saying.</P>
    <P>I know their attitude at the present <Col N="291" /> time.  They requested me to ask why was it that the Government&mdash;and it is a Government however it is made updeserted one of the most important points of its published programme, the removal of the food subsidies.  Will the Taoiseach, his Ministers and the members of his Party answer that question?  Have Deputies Cowan, Browne and others ever questioned the reason why these subsidies were removed?  The people in rural Ireland are always anxious to have attention drawn to this matter.  The Minister who occupies the Front Bench at the moment must be aware of the loss suffered by a widow enjoying a contributory widows' pension when she comes to the age of 70.  Are we to give a vote of confidence and by so doing show that we condone such acts? Are we prepared to say that we are going to give a vote of confidence in favour of the pie kings and others in this city?  We believe we are dealing with a much bigger problem.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no advantage in discussing whether a Government should go to the country following the winning or losing of a by-election but I naturally question the attitude of the Taoiseach at the present time in view of what history has shown us since 1932-33.  Members of the House stated that if one said &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to the Taoiseach at one time off he ran to the country.  I maintain that was wrong then and I believe that under normal circumstances such should not be the case.</P>
    <P>We know quite well that the Government are not anxious for this election. If they get their vote they can carry on.  As a result of the Government's inaction for the past two years, we are entitled to say that we cannot expect the results which Deputy Cowan put into the mouth of the Taoiseach this evening to say when he was winding up his speech.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach stands up he will probably assure Deputy Cowan that everything will be done according to him and he will probably agree with Deputy Browne, the Deputy who at one stage bemoaned what was happening <Col N="292" /> but did not wait for an answer. He, himself, decided what he was going to do.  We believe in the ideals of men like Connolly and Jim Larkin. We believe that by being on the Government Benches, even at financial loss to ourselves, the Labour Party could see to it by its activity in the councils of Government that the working people were treated justly.  That is our reason for asking for an election and wishing for a change.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be hard on anyone, even those in the present Government and not for one moment do I suggest that they are holding on for any set purpose.  I am not going to condemn anyone.  I am making our own position clear.  Let me now refer to another point.  The possibility of bringing some Deputies here who have been ill was mentioned in the House and in the newspapers.  I would be grieved to learn that any Deputy, irrespective of what Party to which he might belong, was unable to attend this House on account of ill-health. The very fact that a Deputy is not able to attend through ill-health is a very great handicap to that Deputy. My sympathy goes openly to the members, who because of ill-health, find it difficult to attend.  I say openly that I hope these members will be able to attend.  It does not matter to what Party they belong.  It will be some comfort to us to see returning to this House all those Deputies who through ill-health had to be absent.</P>
    <P>On one occasion&mdash;it was mentioned here during this debate&mdash;during the lifetime of the inter-Party Government there was an important vote on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In the newspapers, on the following morning, attention was focussed not on the Deputies who were present but on those who were missing.  Probably through error and I would certainly say not intentionally, it mentioned the name of one Deputy as being absent.  The truth is that the Deputy named was on the flat of his back, critically ill at home at the time.  I happen to have been that Deputy.  All of us from time to time go through those periods.  I want to say that, while our attitude to this <Col N="293" /> vote of confidence is one of complete opposition, I as one Deputy will be very pleased indeed to see the faces of those Deputies who, through misfortune, were not able to be with us here for some time past.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot said already on this motion.  May I say that, in my opinion, there is no need for the Minister for External Affairs, for Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne or other Deputies to worry about the Labour Party?  We are determined to continue on the line that we adopted even in the 1932 period.  Fianna Fáil did not object to our line at that time.  If there have been changes since the 1939-40 period, the changes were not on our side.  They were on the Government side.  I propose to give my view of what I believe is wrong and, to a certain degree, I will not blame the Taoiseach or any member of the Government Party.  What is wrong is this. Years ago we had a parliamentary Party in this country, and in their own day they did good work.  As time passed, you had a younger generation coming along.  The younger generation saw that the activities of the old Party were such that the desired results for the country could not be obtained.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should remember that. I am not one who would speak in a critical tone of any person because of his age.  I believe in the old saying that we should respect age, but, politically speaking, what is wrong with Fianna Fáil is that the only similarity between them now and 1932 is in the name.  They are the same Party in name but only in name because they are living in the past. They are still content to bring out the importance of some of the social measures they introduced in the Dáil in the 1930 period, solidly supported as they were at the time by Labour. They are satisfied to dwell on that record and on the past.  What they fail to understand is that the people of the country cannot afford to live in the past.  It is because we in the Labour Party realise the necessity of moving with the times, that we could not, in any circumstances, say that we are satisfied with the policy of either <Col N="294" /> the Taoiseach or the Government at the present time.  They will have to move on, too.  I consider that it will be impossible for them to move on now in spite of the generous encouragement given to them by Deputy Cowan and the pleading of Deputy Dr. Browne.  When a machine slows up and the members of it are content to live on old glories, then the future is bleak indeed.  We cannot say that we are going to accept a bleak future for the people in rural Ireland.  Of course, the Deputies representing the cities have their problems, too.</P>
    <P>It was little satisfaction for us to see the happy faces there were when Deputy Cogan handed down a Sunday newspaper to Deputy MacCarthy who, in turn, handed it on to Deputy Cowan. We had a certain amount of merriment in the House during the reading of the headlines from that newspaper.  Deputy Cowan, apparently, thought he had made a very good joke.  It is no joke for the people outside.  I imagine that the people in Dublin, faced with the problem of unemployment, an increase in the cost of living, in many cases of bad housing, and of emigration would derive very poor satisfaction from seeing the happy faces of some Deputies while these headlines were being read.  That is why we say this subject is of such seriousness not only for those living in rural Ireland but those living in the cities and towns as well.  The fatherly advice of Deputy Cowan in asking for plans will not bring into the homes of the people even the hope of getting employment within a short period.</P>
    <P>The numbers of the unemployed have been mentioned.  We have got the figures of 60,000 and 70,000.  The two words, &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; and &ldquo;emigration&rdquo;, are very often bandied about here.  Unfortunately, the history of this State over the last 30 years seems to have been linked up, to a certain degree, with unemployment and emigation. Thank God, neither was on the same desperate scale between 1948 and 1951 as in the last two years.  In our opinion, it will not suffice for any Party or Government or any number of Parties to say that they are prepared to move around in a circle and <Col N="295" /> then say, when they are in office as a Government, that they are satisfied. That is not going to satisfy the people. What saved the Government of this country over the last 30 years was the deadly factor of emigration, because if many of our young people did not have to emigrate the politicians during that period would certainly have had to produce the goods by way of providing employment or else face a revolution.  The sad part of it is&mdash; Deputy Cowan mentioned it&mdash;the danger of the scarcity of food in other countries.  How many hundreds of thousands of our own young people are in those countries at the present time faced, like others, with that danger?</P>
    <P>The fact is that our problem here has never been tackled as it should have been.  What certainly was never tackled by Fianna Fáil, as the Government of the country, was the question of providing an alternative to emigration. I listened to the Minister for Defence last night.  I would say for him that the approach he made to that question was, from his angle, an honest approach.  I do say, however, that he made one slip when he mentioned that the Parties on this side of the House &mdash;I am speaking now as a member of the Labour Party&mdash;did not favour the turf campaign while on the Government side.  As regards that question, everybody knows that the plain truth of it is that it was the action of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, in sending out a circular to the local authorities towards the end of 1947, which was the main cause of a slowing up in the turf campaign.</P>
    <P>We all know that at a later period when a Labour Party Minister was Minister for Local Government, he had every surveyor from every local authority in the Twenty-Six Counties up here at the Custom House and he told them to make sure they got going with the turf drive that would bring in three years' supply for local authorities.</P>
    <P>If we are going to discuss these problems can we not discuss them in an honourable, truthful manner?  It is by coming to the point and perhaps <Col N="296" /> listening to the views of others that we may see some way out but we will never see the way out of our present dilemma for the people of this country by being satisfied to continue the policy of the present Government.  I will go further to say this, that time will tell, not perhaps after the next election.  It may take a little while, but the time will come when even members of the present Fianna Fáil Party will be, because of their own honest and open convictions, members in this House of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We know and other members of this House know what I mean by that.  Let the time come for joining of forces. We do not mind whether we are accused inside or outside the House of place-hunting.  I stated my case openly a while ago in regard to the responsibility of office; we are prepared to accept that responsibility and we are prepared to get every ounce of strength that is in us to work for the people who are sending us here.  We owe them that obligation.  I do not mind what flat contradiction I would get now, but I know some of the Fianna Fáil members&mdash;as I know others&mdash;and I am glad to know them, as friends.</P>
    <P>But the time will come when in spite of the prophecy of the present Minister for Finance and in spite of the continuous worry of Deputy Cowan for the Labour Party, they will find that never will the Labour Party be swallowed up by any Party, even including Fianna Fáil, who certainly tried to get the upperhand and did their best to crush the Labour Party. It could not be done.  It was built on too solid a foundation for that.</P>
    <P>Our policy will one day be put into operation when the bemoaning of such Deputies as Deputy Cowan, Deputy Browne and others will be forgotten. They will then realise that ours is the only true policy for the people of this country and that it is not a policy such as that to which we are asked to give a vote of confidence this evening.  That is only a delaying action.  We do not mind whether it is a month, a year or two years, it will not remedy the situation.  The Taoiseach, the members of his Government and his back benchers realise that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Let it be that we must accept the decision of this House.  The Taoiseach can also accept it, but he must remember that in accepting that vote of confidence, if he gets such, while he is justly entitled to continue in this House&mdash;any Party might do it if they were in such a position&mdash;he is betraying the confidence of the Irish people. He is showing that the policy of the present Government, an old antiquated policy, is the policy of ruination in 1953 and the only alternative to that is the voice of the people and the sending back here of people who are prepared to work in the interests of the working people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some things said by the last Deputy with which I could agree and some things with which I could not agree.  However, there is one thing in particular I am glad he said, and that is, that there is no financial incentive to any Deputy to cross the floor from one side of the House to the other.  I will go so far as to say that there is no financial incentive to keep a Deputy in this House at all.</P>
      <P>My experience of the Deputies I have known here over the years was that they always left this place poorer men than when they came into it.  I suppose I could say the same with regard to Ministers.  None of them would suffer any financial loss by crossing over to the Opposition side of the House and none of the Opposition would gain financially by coming over here.  I think we all accept that position and if we are arguing whether one person or another wants to be in the Government, it is due entirely to the fact that we think we can run this country better than the Opposition. The Opposition think they can run it better than we can, and that is not an unworthy motive to stir any Deputy to take sides in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to speak at length.  I merely wish to deal with a few points, first of all, unemployment.  While I do not want anything I say to be taken as excusing the position of unemployment, I think it is only right that in dealing with unemployment we should <Col N="298" /> see the facts as they really are.  What I want to say in particular is that the comparisons between the numbers now and the numbers two or three years ago are not really reliable; in fact, they are not fair, if you like, to the present Government.  As a result of the Social Welfare Act which was passed and put into operation last January, there are many on the live register who would not be there if that Act had not been passed.  Deputies may ask how that occurs.  I could give several instances which would prove my point.</P>
    <P>First of all, as you are aware, agricultural workers were brought in to be eligible for unemployment insurance. Before the last Act came into operation, a man who was out of work was only entitled to receive a day's relief for every stamp he had on his card.  If for instance, he was working 26 weeks, he would have 26 stamps and he would receive only 26 days' relief.  As a result of the Social Welfare Act which was recently passed, a man who has 26 stamps on his card is entitled to 26 weeks' relief.  It is very hard to calculate what the difference is but certainly it has made a great difference and means that many people now are drawing unemployment insurance who would have been on unemployment assistance if the Act had not been passed.</P>
    <P>On the unemployment assistance side, the benefits, of course are higher and the means limit is higher.  Again, there are many eligible to draw unemployment assistance now who were not eligible before the Act was passed. In the cities, for instance, the means of a person were raised from £52 to £98 as the limit above which he could not draw unemployment assistance.  In the towns there was a bigger increase and at least as big an increase in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Under the reciprocal arrangements which were made with the British enabling an Irishman working in England&mdash;or an Englishman for that matter&mdash;who comes over here, having lost his job in England, to get relief, there are more people qualifying now than before and that again accounts for a certain number.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> If anybody reads the weekly returns, which indeed are not very nice reading &mdash;they do not give anybody any great pleasure&mdash;they will notice that under one particular heading there is a big increase, that is, &ldquo;Others.&rdquo;  The reason for that is that, under the Social Welfare Act, a person who is out of employment can have credited contributions as they are called.  He does not put on stamps but by calling to the exchange and proving he is unemployed, he can have credited contributions put on his card.  These credited contributions will count for such purposes as widows' and orphans' pensions and other benefits. There was no reason why such people, who are not entitled, to, say, unemployment assistance because their means were high, or for some other reason, would call to the exchange last year.  There is reason why they should call this year and I think that accounts for the number of others being higher than it was last year.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to give any estimate of that.  I asked my Department to give some estimate of the number on the live register as a result of the Social Welfare Act and a number was given to me of between 9,000 and 10,000 but the officers who gave it to me told me that it was not a reliable figure and was only an opinion as far as they were concerned.  I do not want, therefore, to make that point but I do say that the number is somewhat higher than it would have been if that Act had not been passed.</P>
    <P>There is another point, that gradually from year to year the volume of employment is going up, that there are more stamps being sold each year than in the previous year and, if we take the increase from 1950 to 1952, it would indicate additional employment of 25,000 people, which is a very substantial number.  So, even though the number on the live register may be increasing, there is an increase going on all the time in employment but it is not sufficient to catch up on the number on the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to agree with other speakers in this House that the unemployment problems is a grave problem and I am prepared to say, <Col N="300" /> also, that it is a problem that the Government should concern themselves with and have been concerning themselves with, as I hope to mention in a few minutes.  In that way, we are, I think, taking a somewhat different line from the Fine Gael Government when they were in office in 1922 to 1932. They took the line that it was a matter for the ordinary economic law and not a matter for a Government to deal with the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Some few months ago unemployment in the building trade made itself very much felt.  I do not know whether there are any official reasons or any better reasons given than the reason I have in mind.  I see, passing through the city and the outskirts of the city, that for the first time for many years there are many houses for sale.  That being so, there is an easing off in the building of private houses and a slackness in the building trade.</P>
    <P>Therefore, every Minister was asked some time ago to see if in his Department where building was being done something could be done to get works going with the greatest possible speed that would absorb some of those unemployed in the building trade in Dublin, for a start anyway.  In my Department, as I have responsibility for building hospitals and health centres, and so on, through the local authority, of course, I was able to report back to the Government that by hurrying things a bit we could employ 600 men immediately.  Most of these 600 have been employed as far as I know by now, and we could reach 1,600 men probably within nine or 12 months. That is not an awful lot, I admit, but it is done by one Department of State. Other Departments may be able to do more, for all I know.  I have not seen their returns.  At any rate, an effort is being made to deal first of all with that single problem of unemployment in the building trade in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of money being spent in my Department on building.  In fact the estimate for grants given by my Department for building of hospitals and health centres throughout the country is higher this year than it has ever been <Col N="301" /> before.  I do not mind admitting that I was anxious to push these building projects on as speedily as possible on account of the unemployment in the building industry generally.</P>
    <P>I mention these things, as some Deputies appear to think we have either been unaware of the unemployment problem or have ignored it or taken no action, to show that we have been taking action, and I hope, indeed, that more can be done than the few matters I mentioned just now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned in the course of his speech that there were two years of inaction.  I do not think that is very fair.  Deputy Desmond mentioned on more than one occasion during his speech that he wanted to be fair to both sides, and so on, but I do not think it is quite fair for a Labour Deputy to say that no action was taken in the last two years when we realise that a Labour Deputy was Minister for Social Welfare for three and a half years during which very little action was taken, and that Fianna Fáil is in office for only two years now and a Social Welfare Act has been passed during those two years.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy will look at the Book of Estimates he will see that the taxpayer is asked to contribute £20.5 million to social welfare during the present year.  It may be of interest to some of the Deputies who, evidently, have come to believe that nothing was done by this Government in social services or anything else to analyse the figures into the amounts contributed and to see how it is built up to £20.5 million.  When the British Government left here it was £4,000,000 and when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government left office after ten years it was still £4,000,000.  The Coalition Government, who were in office for three and a half years, added £1,500,000 that is £5,500,000 and Fianna Fáil added the rest, that is £15,000,000. I do not think that Deputy Desmond could pride himself on being fair to all sides when he talked of the Fianna Fáil Government not doing anything in the last two years to improve social conditions, or not doing anything in that line.  That is if you like a very short history of social welfare.  I do <Col N="302" /> not at this stage want to worry Deputies by repeating things said before and, in any event, I did not intend to make a very long speech or to go back over all the various schemes that were passed in the years.  I do want to say this, however, that the people who are unemployed now are getting better benefit than they were getting before this time last year.</P>

They did nothing and we added £15,000,000 to the sum being paid out each year for social services.</P>

      <P>Let us deal with this unemployment and social services question on its own and I will come to the cost of living if the Deputies will allow me.  I do not want to be too long just speaking on a few matters.  I am not blaming the Labour Party that this <Col N="304" /> Social Welfare Bill was not brought in between 1948 and 1951.  We know now the game, how Deputy McGilligan fought a war of attrition against Deputy Norton during that time to prevent Deputy Norton bringing it in, and it just shows what might happen again if there is a Coalition and what is certain to happen if Fine Gael comes back, as they hope to come back, with a clear majority and takes over the government of this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned one specific instance and said that he would vote against the Government because when a widow reaches 70 her benefit goes down.  That is true, because under the widows' contributory pension she gets 24/- and when she comes to 70 she becomes an old age pensioner and then gets only 21/6.  Now that is, if you like, an anomaly in the scheme, but I do not think that the Labour Party should be too hard on us.  I am not appealing to the Fine Gael Party on this.  I do not think the Labour Party should be too hard on us after all if we bring in a scheme that is going to put £7,000,000 on the taxpayer if there are a few anomalies like this.  They should have a little patience, I think, and give us a chance to let the country improve a bit and see whether these things could not be made right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were satisfied when we brought in our Social Welfare Bill in 1952 that we had covered nearly all the hazards, as they say, that the ordinary person is up against&mdash;sickness and unemployment and widowhood and old age and so on; but there was one thing also which I mentioned at the time and I said that it was impossible to put it into that Bill but I said that when a Health Bill came along that particular thing would be included. Now to the knowledge of all of us there is the incapacitated person who is not <Col N="305" /> a widow or an old age pensioner, who is not insured and therefore cannot get sickness benefit, who cannot get unemployment benefit because he was never employed at anything, but who is incapacitated and still without means to maintain himself.  We all know the type of person I mention, who is a permanent invalid and a burden to that extent on his family.  In the Health Bill we have provided for that particular type of case.  There is a clause in the Health Bill which enables local authorities to bring in the necessary schemes to deal with that, but I again say to the Labour Party that if they reject Fianna Fáil whenever they get a chance and accept Fine Gael, Fine Gael will throw out the Health Bill and that particular clause goes with it.  There is no doubt about that. So as far as the social schemes are concerned they are not complete in my opinion until that class of people is brought in, and that class of people can be brought in if the Health Bill is made law.</P>
      <P>Now coming to the Health Department, we all agree, I think, in this House, at least I have heard this principle enunciated from every Party, that no person should be deprived of the best medical care through lack of means.  While all the Parties say that, Fianna Fáil has made several attempts to bring in Health Bills that would cover that principle by providing medical treatment for those who cannot afford to pay for it, but for eight years now&mdash;I think since 1945&mdash;Fine Gael has been fighting it all the time.  Although they agree with the principle they fight anybody who tries to meet that principle by legislation.  Deputy Mulcahy in this House only last week, I think, boasted that the Health Bill of 1945 was for 15 days in Committee. Now evidently that was obstruction, and they are going to beat that record, I think, on the present Health Bill, which shows again that Fine Gael is never short of pious platitudes and fine principles but will always oppose anybody who tries to put them into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again we come back to 1922-32, when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was on its own.  Nothing was done for <Col N="306" /> health and no attempt was made to build hospitals, dispensaries or anything else, or to make any improvement in the health services.  As a matter of fact, in 1932, when we came into office we took over those buildings &mdash;they were described as hospitals&mdash; throughout the country in the primitive condition in which they were handed over in 1922 by the British. Nothing whatever had been done.  Still we have the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Costello, making speeches here on the Health Bill saying that his Party is prepared to spend £10,000,000 on that.  What is the scheme?  He did not tell us.  Although the members of Fine Gael are opposing this Health Bill all the time, saying that it is a bad Bill and contains a bad scheme, they have never given the slightest indication of what a better scheme would be.  We can come to the conclusion that they have not got a better scheme in mind and do not want to have one in mind.</P>
    <P>The policy of Fine Gael would appear to be delay in health matters. They practised that policy very successfully during the three and a half years of the Coalition Government. When the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, was pushing very hard to get a health scheme through, it was a case of delay all the time.  Now when the present Health Bill is before the Dáil it is again a case of delay, delay, delay.  I take it that that would be their policy if they were to get a chance to take over the government of the country again.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word or two about agriculture.  We all agree on a certain principle, that is, on the expansion of agriculture on a mixed farming basis.  Although any Fine Gael Deputy would say that that was his policy, expansion on a mixed farming basis, wherever an attempt was made by any other Government to encourage mixed farming it was always opposed by Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey may not like it, but it is no harm to talk a bit about the past and then come on to the future.  As a principle, Fine Gael lays down that you must have expansion of agriculture on a mixed farming basis, but just as in the case of health, it is a grand principle until you come to put it into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we advocated wheat growing in 1929 the Cumann na nGaedheal Government at the time&mdash;none of those gentlemen opposite were in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government at that time, so they cannot be held responsible &mdash;got out a pamphlet at Government <Col N="308" /> expense and proved that wheat could not be grown in this country. They distributed that pamphlet to all the papers and to prominent farmers and others.  I remember speaking at a debate in University College shortly afterwards and a very prominent economist&mdash;who, of course, was a member of Fine Gael&mdash;said, when someone mentioned wheat: &ldquo;That is over and done with; it has been proved to be impossible.&rdquo;  That is their attitude when something is put up that we should do in order to expand our agriculture on a mixed farming basis. Deputy Dillon, who served his time as Minister for Agriculture, said on one occasion that he would not be got dead in a field of wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave an increase of £1 a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the attitude of Fine Gael, who all the time talked about expanding on a mixed farming basis.  In order to promote this expansion, Fianna Fáil realised when the war was over that the fertility of the soil had to be improved and they had prepared a scheme for the distribution of lime.  When Deputy Dillon came in, I need not tell you that he told his officials he would not have the Fianna Fáil scheme.  He tried several others and after a couple of years came back to it, but we lost two years in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey asked me to talk about the future.  We have a lime scheme which I think is ready for publication and should be published certainly within a week or two.  I believe it will give farmers lime for the land without the unnecessary restrictions that were there under the old scheme.  What is more, it certainly will not induce a person to carry lime from one end of the country to the other&mdash;which appeared to be the most remunerative business under the lime scheme brought in by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the production side of agriculture we have milk, which is a very important commodity.  I think I can truthfully say that there is now an upward trend in milk production which has not been noticeable since the beginning <Col N="309" /> of the war.  We know, of course, that farmers were very disheartened and discouraged when asked to accept 1/- a gallon instead of the 1/2 they had been getting up to that and they were disillusioned, I should think, when they were told they could keep the 1/2 and get a penny as well, when the election was coming along. Naturally, you cannot get farmers to work on an insecure basis of that kind &mdash;a reduction at one time and an increase at another time.  The production of milk was not improving; it was only at a standstill, if it were not, indeed, going back.  Now that prices have been fixed on a firm basis, the production is going up.</P>
    <P>The same applies to pigs.  I suppose Deputies who were in this House at the time of the Coalition Government will remember the way the Minister for Agriculture at the time, Deputy Dillon, was changing from day to day in his policy on pigs and bacon.  He hardly knew himself, indeed, what was the policy at any particular time and certainly his officials did not know. The farmers gave up inquiring and carried on on their own.  Under that mismanagement and vacillation of the Minister for Agriculture at the time the industry declined and was almost ruined.  But it is now recovering and this year there would appear to be a very big increase in the production of bacon.  It has certainly reached the highest point since the war and it is getting back towards pre-war level. The policy pursued by the present Minister for Agriculture will, I am sure, restore milk production and bacon production back to pre-war levels.  In fact I should say they will exceed the production of that time.  I should also like to tell some of the Deputies who may not be aware of it that the home consumption of bacon and butter at the moment is higher than it was pre-war.</P>

      <P>There will, I am sure, be a big increase in production generally in agriculture during the present year.  If you take the figures of the seed distributors, the returns of the sugar company, the returns of milk to the creameries, and the returns of pigs to bacon factories, every one of them shows an increase over recent years.  I think there is not the slightest doubt that there will be a very big increase in agricultural production during the present year, which should improve as the years go on.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell on the question of industry because I presume the Minister for Industry and Commerce will deal with that matter more fully than I could attempt to do. Deputies, however, will realise that a very big and successful effort was made between 1932 and 1939 to build up industries in this country against the opposition of the Fine Gael Party.  But, in 1951, when we came back to office, we were faced with stockpiling of various goods which made it impossible for many of our factories to carry on for some time. We are now, I think, on the road again to higher industrial production, and the figure I mentioned already, which went to show there were 25,000 more people employed in 1952 than in 1950 would indicate that there was an increase in industrial production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not know whether the Deputy is serious, but the number of stamps sold for that year as compared with 1950 would show that on the average number of weeks that people are employed&mdash;I think 40 weeks are taken and that is how the average works out&mdash;there would be 25,000 more employed.  That average may not be correct, however.  I have an idea myself that people may be working more constantly and, therefore, may be employed more than 40 weeks at the moment, and in that way there may not have been 25,000 more employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That factor was taken into consideration.  I should like to make it plain that the number of stamps sold showed that for the same number of weeks worked there were 25,000 more employed in 1952 than in 1950.  Personally, I am inclined to think that there are a greater number of weeks worked and, therefore, that there were not 25,000 more people employed. Whichever way you take it, however, it was a good thing.  I think Deputies will agree, however, that both agriculture and industry benefited by many advantages.  Deputy Desmond mentioned the point I want to make.  He said that more output means more employment because more people will be needed.  That will mean, I hope, less unemployment and, if there is more employment, there will be more money spent which will again lead to subsidiary employments.  That would again give us a position, I hope, in which we could get a better yield from taxation.  We will have an opportunity then of either having better services or of reducing taxation, whichever might appear to be the more preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite have condemned the removal of the food subsidies very vigorously.  I do not know whether they were perfectly fair or honest in that or whether it was done because it is good politics.  There is another point of view, however.  Personally, I think, and the Government had the same idea, that it is better that everything should be open and above board as to what food is costing.  Everybody knows that we have to see that the farmer gets a certain return for his milk, for his pigs, for his wheat, for his sugar beet and so on.  That means that as far as consumers are concerned they have to pay a certain amount for bread, sugar, butter and bacon, at least somebody has to pay.  The question is whether it is better that the consumer should pay and let everybody see how the economics of this country are working or whether the Government should intervene and subsidise to a certain extent and then get the <Col N="312" /> cost of that subsidy in taxation.  I think it is better to have it open and above board, that people should know that if they are paying 4/2 a lb. for butter it is because the farmer must get a return for his milk.  He has to pay his men and he has to keep himself and his family and he needs this return for his milk and the price of butter must be 4/2 a lb.</P>

      <P>Do not be dragging in red herrings.  Let me develop my argument. I am putting it in a reasonable way.  Deputies may disagree with me if they like, but I think it is better policy that we should let everybody see what the price of butter is.  That means, of course, that wages must be adjusted to meet the cost of living as it results from that policy.  As far as the Government are concerned, they have never opposed that.  In fact, I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time these food subsidies were being abolished saying that there would be an increase of wages to meet this.  I think it is a better system that wages should be adjusted to the level commensurate with the new cost of living as a result of the removal of the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>At the same time we did increase the unemployment benefit, the sickness benefit, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions, the whole lot of them.  We did increase the social benefits to an extent, in our opinion that would meet the increase in the cost of living at the time.  Deputies might argue we did not give enough and perhaps to some extent that may <Col N="313" /> be so, but I want to say we followed certain principles.  We followed that principle to the logical conclusion by admitting the fact that we knocked up the cost of living and by increasing wherever we were responsible, the social benefits to meet the increased cost of foods as a result of the removal of the food subsidies.  In any way in which we were responsible, we tried to compensate the people for it.</P>

      <P>Anybody looking at the figures will agree that we have reduced <Col N="314" /> imports by supplying our needs from home production and I think we have succeeded in going a bit further than that because we have also increased exports.  Not only are we supplying what was cut off in the way of imports, but we added to exports, a proof that production is increasing in this country and that, of course, can be responsible &mdash;it takes time&mdash;but it can be responsible for permanent employment.</P>
      <P>Deputies also talk about this capital business, but I do not think a Government at any time provided so much for capital expenditure as we have provided in this Budget.  It is about £40,000,000.  As far as my Department is concerned, it was never so much before for capital expenditure as it is this year.  I think that also applies to other Departments fairly generally, and, at any rate, the figure generally is very high.</P>
      <P>We had, of course, a great deal of talk from Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Labour and others, about capital expansion for the three and a half years they were in power.  It was just talk.  There was not any great capital expansion at that time.  They were all talking but they did not do very much.  I have been looking back to see what did they do.  They did nothing very much in the way of expansion of electricity, nor in the way of expansion of turf production.  In fact, they allowed turf production to lapse practically for the first couple of years they were in office, and only when they were threatened with a shortage of coal did they come back in panic and start turf production again. I do not think there was an awful lot spent, certainly not as much as at the present time.  It was again a case of Fine Gael doing the talking and Fianna Fáil doing the work.</P>

I looked around to see what capital expansion was done by the Coalition Government.

We want to know in what form they will be brought back and I hold we are taking the proper course in spending money on capital development, which will, we hope, give permanent and good employment.</P>

      <P>In all these things, whether health, social welfare or capital development, Fine Gael has always a grand principle which everybody can agree with, but they never do anything. Or if anybody else tries to do anything, they try delaying action, or stop them as best they can.  That is their policy all along.  There are no good works to their credit, and I suppose they cannot have faith, if so.  We certainly have the good works.</P>
      <P>We are talking here, trying to convert certain people on one side of the House, and the Opposition are trying to convert the other side of the House. I think we can say about Fine Gael truthfully&mdash;I do not think anybody can contradict it&mdash;that as far as political advancement is concerned, or as far as economic development is concerned or social improvement, they have a shameful record, one they should be ashamed of, because they did nothing in all these things in all their time.

I heard Deputy Cowan, significantly speaking from the same seat from which he spoke three years ago.  Every Deputy in this House has changed his place but Deputy Cowan. He was singing my praises from that seat three years ago.  Now he is singing Fianna Fáil's praises from that seat.  Doubtless, if any future Government in this country permits him to sing their praises, he will sing them as sweetly as he sings Fianna Fáil's praises now.  I heard him rebuking Deputy Hickey because all minds are not bent upon what rends his heart, the plight of the unemployed.  It makes me physically sick to hear Deputy Cowan letting his heart bleed in the market place about the unemployed, calling on all honest men to rally round and put dissension from amongst them, so that they can join with this angel of peace in the resolution of the problems of the unemployed. Who made them unemployed? What made them unemployed?</P>

      <P>We told the Deputy when the Budget of 1952 was before this House: &ldquo;If this Finance Bill is enacted into law, its purpose and its aim is to create unemployment&rdquo;.  I say now that the increase in the bank rate, the raising of the Government rate of borrowing, and every section of the Finance Bill of 1952 were designed to create unemployment.  That was its purpose as Deputy Cowan cannot deny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that measure was under discussion in this House, every Deputy speaking from these benches and from the Labour Benches warned him that inevitably the economic policy enshrined in that Budget would create unemployment.  We said deliberately &mdash;and I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce agreed with us&mdash;that its purpose was to create unemployment, that the policy of the Minister for Finance in the present Government was to create in this country a pool of unemployment, which he deemed it economically expedient to do.  I believe that Deputy Cowan knows that as well as I do but he voted for it.

    <P>I do not believe in unduly castigating any Deputy in this House but there are limits to human patience.  Deputy Cowan in the course of his speech took exception to a remark which I made to Deputy Corish when I said: &ldquo;I am not fooled by this hypocritical blatherskite.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Wait a moment.  When we were in office any man who wanted to build a house in this country could afford to build it.  These are facts. I always believed that the best arguments are facts.  The best test of policy is results.  (<i>Interruptions.</i>) Deputy Cowan was smiling with an angelic blush when I began but the smile has been knocked off his face now.</P>

      <P>You do not knock a smile off Deputy Cowan's face unless he is hurt.  I do not want to hurt him. All I need do is to turn on Deputy Cowan, not the blackmailer's searchlight, but the searchlight of fact and he squeals both loud and long.  If I were in his dilemma I would squeal too, under the impact of light, but have I said one word about him that does not relate to recorded facts?  I do not think so.  Let him challenge any fact I have now alleged to defend <Col N="320" /> himself.  He cannot.  When he sees facts arrayed against him, he is ashamed and he is rightly ashamed. I would remind Deputies that Deputy Peader Cowan is no fool.  He is the cutest political manæuvrer in this municipality.</P>

      <P>There is not a trick that the Deputy does not know.  He has played pretty nearly every card he has got and he will shortly be given the opportunity of playing the rest of them.  I do not think they are going to win the trick and I do not think Deputy Peadar Cowan has much hope that they will, either.  Now listen, it is to him, in his impregnable electoral position, it is to Deputy Cogan who, in the course of the last by-election loyally exhorted Miss Bobbett's voters to cast their preferences for Fianna Fáil and was able to transfer 600 votes for the whole of Wicklow&mdash;it is to these two and to Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll that the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, appeals from North-West Dublin, Wicklow and East Cork.</P>
      <P>I will not use the word that so much distressed Deputy Cowan.  Was there ever a more disreputable court of appeal?  Is there a safe constituency amongst the whole four of them&mdash;and cross your heart and hope to die, if Deputy Jack Flynn had not taken refuge in the Fianna Fáil Party, would there have been a safe constituency in the whole &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo;?  It is to them that Fianna Fáil is appealing from the verdict of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who started this debate?  Whose motion are we discussing?  Is it not the Taoiseach's motion?  He put down the motion.  What made him put it down?  Presumably, in the first week of July, with the Estimates and the financial business still to be disposed of, and much legislation, he did not put it down for fun.  Let us get back to facts.  We are discussing a motion put down by the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera.  Is it not fair to ask why he put down that motion?  He spoke <Col N="321" /> for an hour when he was introducing this motion and, in the whole of that hour's address, he never once referred to North-West Dublin, Wicklow or East Cork.  But was not the development in those three constituencies the occasion of this motion?</P>
    <P>I think I can prove, not from his speech in introducing this motion&mdash;in which he never told us at all why he put it down&mdash;but from his past pronouncements that the Taoiseach was induced to put down this motion of confidence in the Government by the three by-elections.  Speaking in Waterford on the 12th October, 1947, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you want something different; if you want a change of Government, then of course, there will be sense in voting against the Government candidate, because then you will indicate quite clearly that you want a change of Government. . . .</P>
    <P>I assure you that if the people in these by-elections give such an indication we shall understand it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda</i> of October 13th, 1947. From the same source of the 20th October, 1947, the Taoiseach, speaking at Tipperary on the 19th October, 1947, is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . if a Government were weakened, it was not able to do its work properly, and if the Government were weakened by the result of the by-elections, there would be nothing for it but to settle the question by a general election.  Mr. de Valera said that he thought that the people would agree with him that that was right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking in Tuam on the 27th January, 1948&mdash;and, this time, it is to another patron, particularly of the Tánaiste, from whom I quote, the <i>Irish Times,</i> who, I understand, would be glad to see a commonsensical kind of Government under the leadership of the Tánaiste to replace the present chaos&mdash;the Taoiseach is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . recent by-elections seemed to indicate that people might not support them as they had done <Col N="322" /> before.  If that were so, he said, they would be a weak Government, and it would be better that they should get out.  If they wanted to have progress, they must have a Government that was strong, supported by the people, and thus assured of its position. . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking at Dingle on the 20th January, 1948, the Taoiseach is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the following day as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . instead of remaining in office for another year and a half, as they could have done, they had decided to hold a general election, because they believed that a weak Government could not properly serve this country, and the by-elections had weakened them as a Government.</P>
    <P>It would be pointed out to them during the next year and a half that while they had a majority they had not a majority of the people supporting them . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking at Cahirciveen on the 19th January, 1948,&mdash;and here I return to the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda</i> as my authority the Taoiseach is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Government is strong only if it has a majority in Parliament, because with our system, the Government depends on the majority it has in Parliament.  It is a weak Government if it has not a strong majority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is balm to Deputy Peadar Cowan's soul.  Unlike Deputy Peadar Cowan, I am going to read the next paragraph intentionally, whereas he had the misfortune to read his paragraph unintentionally:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not strong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the Taoiseach said</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;merely because it has a parliamentary majority.  If it can be suggested that a Government is not supported by the people, then a Government by that very fact is a weak Government&mdash;if, after these elections, a finger can be pointed at us, and it is said in the Dáil: &lsquo;You have a majority of 12 or 14 over the other <Col N="323" /> Parties, but the people are not behind you&mdash;you have not the majority of the people.&rsquo;  You know that the Opposition would talk in that way, and would be encouraged in their efforts by the fact that that charge could be made.</P>
    <P>We are determined that that charge cannot be made, and if we are to continue as a Government we would have to have a majority in Parliament; be able to show that that majority was reasonably given to us, and that the people were behind us as well as the majority in Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember what the Taoiseach said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . if, after these elections, a finger can be pointed at us, and it is said in the Dáil: &lsquo;You have a majority of 12 or 14 over the other Parties, but the people are not behind you . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I point the finger now and say: &ldquo;Look at your majority&mdash;four Deputies of this House, of which it is virtually certain not a single one would secure reelection in a general election to-morrow.&rdquo; I say to you: &ldquo;You have not got the people behind you&rdquo;&mdash;and I call, in evidence, North-West Dublin, where you went to the contest with a popular and well-known candidate, no less a person than the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and he was beaten two to one. Does anyone challenge that?  You went, then, from a city constituency pleading the alibi that here the impact of the Budget was heavy.  Deputy Cowan forgot, when he was speaking of Waterford and North Mayo and Limerick, that those three by-elections were held before the Budget's impact had struck the people at all.  We told them what is was going to be like. We told them the economic sequela of the Government's economic policy.  A great many of them did not at first believe us&mdash;just like Deputy Peadar Cowan&mdash;but when they saw the result, North-West Dublin defeated the Government two to one.</P>
    <P>We went then to the country, to Wicklow, a constituency which has in it Bray, a large town, and a rural <Col N="324" /> area, and we beat the Government in Wicklow.  We went then to East Cork, a wholly rural constituency, and joined issue with them there and they were beaten there again.</P>

      <P>They never lost a vote. Labour never lost a vote in Wicklow, and this is certain, that the fortunes of the poll put Deputy Deering 37 votes in front of Senator McCrea.  If those 37 votes had gone the other way, Senator McCrea would have won by exactly the same majority as Deputy Deering. That is what makes Deputy Cowan as mad as a gnat.  He knows it and, what is worse for him, he knows we know it and that Labour know it, too.  Am I then extravagant, in the light of these facts, in doing what the Taoiseach said might legitimately be done when he had a majority of 12 or 14 in Dáil Éireann?  Am I presumptuous, unfair or in any degree indulging in political chicanery, if I point a finger at the Tánaiste and say: &ldquo;You have a majority, a rag-bag majority in this House?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All Deputies, however, are entitled to vote with just as good a right and title as the Tánaiste or I, to record their votes so long as they are Deputies, but can they be described as bringing to the present Government the support of the people?  Only one of them has been exposed to that test and his best endeavour could mobilise no more than 600 votes in the whole of County Wicklow&mdash;and, when he speaks, he is bringing to the support of the Government the support of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>If we are to test this situation by the rules laid down by the Leader of the present Government after he had 30 years' experience in public life in Ireland, does not he himself proclaim that, in the circumstances here obtaining, the Government has a clear duty to go to the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and the Minister for Social Welfare fell into a strange error in the course of our discussions here to-day.  All that the Opposition have <Col N="325" /> asked for is to bring this issue to the people and we will abide their verdict, but Deputy Cowan said: &ldquo;Would you ask me, by my vote, to put out Fianna Fáil and put in the inter-Party Government?&rdquo; He knows what would happen if he went to the country.  The Minister for Social Welfare said: &ldquo;Here is our record; read it well.  Why should you expose us to the danger of extinction in the country?  We have done very well from 1932 onwards and look at what the wicked men opposite did&mdash;nothing?&rdquo;  I agree that stravaiging back to 1922 is waste of parliamentary time, but one Deputy must not do it on the assumption that no one else will follow.  The Minister for Social Welfare must not say that Deputies on this side from 1922 to 1932 did nothing for the people of this country, if he is not prepared to hear that they built this State with their right hand while they prevented the Minister from tearing it down with their left.  Let that be brought into account.  I want no more than that.  I want no more inquisition into this dim and distant past.</P>

      <P>I am talking of what I know.  I am talking of men who <Col N="326" /> reared their families in modest comfort and were not beholden to anyone for their ability to do so and the same tale could be told of their fathers, their grandfathers and their ancestors back for generations; but I have seen these men brought low to poverty in such degree that they never raised their heads again.  I have known such men to take their children from the schools where they were under education and send them out, without their learning, to seek their living by manual labour.  I have heard the head of the present Government say across the floor of this House that he could not have omelettes without breaking eggs.  Let not the Minister for Social Welfare talk of his victory in the economic war, without thinking sometimes of the eggs that were broken, of the homes that were broken, of the families that were broken, and let him count the cost of these when he is casting up the measure of his victory.</P>
      <P>I do not want to travel this ground, but it makes me sick to hear the Minister for Social Welfare, who has lived all his life from his profession, talk as though scatheless Fianna Fáil triumphed in a conflict which they boasted they precipitated.  The Tánaiste nods.  I heard the Taoiseach boast that he started the economic war.  I gave them the charity of believing that perhaps they did not understand the measure of the disaster they brought upon our people.  I do not give them that charity now, because they must know what they did to our people in those years and the havoc they wrought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak of facts and I do not think that many words need be wasted in ventilating the issues joined between us.  The fundamental facts are that three by-elections took place and three results were recorded.  The Taoiseach put down a vote of confidence and stands on record in public statement after public statement in relation to what he conceives his true duty to be. All I ask the House, and, looking beyond this House, the country, to do is to judge them on their own words, to judge them on their own acts and then to determine whether they are honest in the public life of Ireland if, with these statements of the Taoiseach <Col N="327" /> on record, they claim successfully to have appealed from three by-elections to Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan, Deputy Browne and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll.</P>
    <P>I want to follow the Minister for Social Welfare in his reference to agriculture. We lately discovered in this country that we all in the last analysis depend upon the land.  That was not always so in Ireland.  I will ask this House to judge the record by the results.  Seventeen years of Fianna Fáil administration in this country, and in June, 1948, there were less cattle on the land of Ireland than at any other time in the previous half century; there were less sheep on the land of Ireland than at any time in the previous century; there were less pigs in Ireland than at any time so far in the present century.  The tillage land of Ireland was so impoverished that the yield of wheat from an acre of Irish land judged by the deliveries to the mill, not by the statistical estimates that optimists make as they look over the fences, had sunk to 6.3 cwt. per statute acre in 1947-48.  Allow for the bad weather and look back a further year: it was 9.8 cwt. per statute acre. I ask any Deputy in this House what is the yield to-day?  Grass in this country manifested the phenomenon hitherto unknown outside the poorest areas in the country that cattle grazing on four inches of grass were dying of starvation where they stood; 80,000 calves perished annually in this country through slaughter or disease.</P>
    <P>All that was the fruit of 17 years of Fianna Fáil administration.  The things I have mentioned so far pale to insignificance beside the most dramatic consequence of all.  The farmers of this country by 17 years of Fianna Fáil administration had been brought so low, so prostrate, that it was possible for a Minister for Agriculture in a Fianna Fáil Government to address them in these terms at Navan on 19th February, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would have had inspectors tucked after them, and I would have tucked them out into fresh land, and I would compel them to break fresh <Col N="328" /> land, and if they did not do it I would tuck in the tractors through the ditches and through the gates and tuck out the land for them. . . .  If the Lord Almighty provides us with good weather that will enable us to make a start, and if there should be a necessity next season to be as rigid as heretofore&mdash;and there may be&mdash;I am going to tell them here and now that I will recruit the full of ten fields of inspectors, and I will spend plenty of money in paying them travelling expenses and everything else, and I will hire all the tractors and machinery I can get and I will go down and pick every one of the &lsquo;cods&rsquo; out and I will say: Take down that piece of wire and put it around the other corner. . . .  When I do that, you can call me a thug or a clod or a driver, whatever you like, I do not care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now these are the sons and the grandsons of the men who won the land war. These are the sons and the grandsons of the men who kept the spirit alive in their country in the darkest hours of our history.  There is the most dramatic sequence of 17 years of Fianna Fáil administration.  It was possible for Deputy Patrick Smith when Minister for Agriculture to say all that and to remain Minister for Agriculture and there was a Party in Dáil Éireann that humbly bowed their heads and accepted that as the proper address of an Irish Minister for Agriculture to the farmers of this country.</P>

      <P>Let us put this to the record of the inter-Party Government: after three short years there is not now a man in Ireland who would dare say that to the farmers now.  If there was nothing else behind it but that record, I would be proud of it.  In addition to that, however, there are facts.  I will state them briefly, more briefly I hope than did the Minister for Social Welfare.  I ask this House and the country to judge a policy and a Party by results and not by promises, not by protestations but by what they achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exports of this country between <Col N="329" /> 1947 and 1952&mdash;remember, price played some part in this&mdash;increased from £39,000,000 to £101,000,000, the highest figure ever recorded in the history of this State.  Agricultural exports over that period increased from £30,000,000 to £75,000,000.  Cattle exports&mdash;reckoning cattle, beef and canned beef in terms of live cattle&mdash;increased from 405,000 in 1947 to 739,000 in 1952.  Listen to these figures.  They speak of the export of cattle in the context I have just employed.  In 1948, 405,000; in 1949, 523,000; in 1950, 591,000; in 1951, 642,000; in 1952, 739,000 and over the same period the cattle stock upon the land of Ireland rose from somewhere like 3,900,000 to 4,376,000, the highest figure ever recorded in the history of this country with the solitary exception of 1921.  Sheep stand to-day at 2,856,000 compared with 2,000,000 in 1947.  Our pigs stand to-day at 750,000, and that figure is rising, compared to about 420,000 in 1947.  I heard the Minister for Social Welfare suggest that it was through some miracle performed by the present Minister for Agriculture that the pig population was increased.  I challenge any honest Deputy to deny that the reason the pig population is increased is because of the security and of the permanent remunerative market secured by the inter-Party Government under the Pigs and Bacon Agreement of 1951 with the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The exports of pigs and bacon in 1947 were nil.  In 1948 they were nil and last year they were valued for £3,317,000.  Exports of sheep, lamb and mutton in 1947 were nil and for years before that.  In 1952 they were over £2,000,000.  Exports of chocolate crumb in 1947 were nil or merely nominal and in 1952-53 they were £5,308,000.  As of the Minister for Agriculture's statement this year introducing his Estimate, 386,000 acres of land were rehabilitated or were in the process of rehabilitation under sections (a) and (b) of the land rehabilitation project on 74,500 farms. Seventy-two thousand soil samples were tested at Johnstown Castle last <Col N="330" /> year.  In 1947 less than 100 samples were tested by one man and a boy in a back room whose entire equipment consisted of one used medicine bottle tied to a discarded bicycle wheel which spun on a sixpenny nail.</P>
      <P>Does anyone challenge that?  I will show them the room, the man and the boy.  I asked them to preserve, as a relic of ould dacency, the medicine bottle, the bicycle wheel and the sixpenny nail.  When I speak of 386,000 acres of land rehabilitated, let me tell the House what that means.  I met a man in Cappoquin who stopped me in the street and said he wanted to see me some time to tell me what the land rehabilitation project meant to him. &ldquo;They did my land,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and where my father and my grandfather kept ten cows we are keeping 30 cows and we could make silage.&rdquo;  I suggest that if Deputies were honest with themselves they could reproduce that picture in almost every parish in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Three-quarters of a million tons of limestone were put out on the land of Ireland last year and in 1947 there was not as much ground limestone in Ireland as would fill an eggcup.  Let us not attribute its production to me or any one individual in this House. It happened when the inter-Party Government was in office.  I would ask the House and the country to judge that Government by results.  We were told to-day by the Minister for Social Welfare that one of our great crimes was that when the inter-Party Government was in office they spent nothing on nobody.  He said that the only thing they did was to collect a huge stockpile that bewildered and perplexed their successors.  Deputy Cowan protests to himself that he is an honest and disinterested man. Does he remember the Tánaiste interrupting me to say, when I criticised the White Paper issued by the Minister for Finance in this House, that there was no stockpile?  &ldquo;None of your increased imports can be explained by the alibi of stockpiling,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;You were on a spending spree.  There is not any stockpiling.&rdquo;</P>

Now that story is abandoned and the stockpile they said did not exist two years ago is their alibi for the unemployment that they themselves created two years later.</P>

      <P>But that is not all.  Now their cry is, according to the Minister for Social Welfare, that we spent nothing on nobody.  How often have I heard at crossroads, in this House and all over Ireland the statement made that so fantastic was our expenditure that the present Government came into office and found waiting for them nothing but mountains of debt to relieve which immense additional taxation had to be put on?  Was not that the case?  Was not that the alibi for the Budget?  That is now to be abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, it is only a month ago since the Taoiseach was forced at a public meeting during the by-election campaign to confess that when he came into office he found on the desk of the Minister for Finance not £22,000,000 but £28,500,000 sterling of the Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart Fund and the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund of which he retained and still to-day retains £6,250,000 unspent.  And then he said: &ldquo;Ah, perhaps there were not debts waiting for us but there were commitments.&rdquo;  No Government in a democratic State can commit its successor. When we came into office we found commitments.  There were Constellations to shuttle to and fro across the Atlantic.  We cancelled that commitment. There were commitments to tear down Merrion Square and build vast new Government buildings in the Phoenix Park and we cancelled that commitment.  We would not be bound by them.  If there was a single commitment of ours that appears to be improvident or wrong how were our successors <Col N="332" /> bound?  Had they not a perfect right to come before Dáil Éireann and say: &ldquo;Our predecessors entered into a commitment to do so and so.  We think they were wrong.  We reject that commitment and cancel it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Distinguish carefully between a contract made by an Irish Government and a commitment.  I can see at once that if any member of the present Government signs a contract with the authority of the Government whoever their successors may be are bound by its provisions but not by its commitments. Now that alibi is being turned round.  Now it is admitted that there were no debts.  On the contrary, there were £28,500,000 sterling waiting to be used as the incoming Government thought fit and the Minister for Social Welfare confirms that by saying that the crime we committed while in office was that we spent nothing on nobody. Unlike us, he proposes to spend more on everybody than was ever spent before, but there is this remarkable distinction. I heard Deputy Davin, who has forty years' experience in the public life of Ireland and who has never been silenced by any interests however powerful, say that in his considered judgment the day we left office there was virtually full employment in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy in Dáil Éireann to-day who would have the hardihood to say so much now?  Was it not a proud achievement to be able to boast of, that such a very old and respected figure in the Labour movement as Deputy Davin would stake his reputation on the proposition in public that, in his memory, there was never a better condition of employment obtaining in rural Ireland than there was at the end of the three years of our Administration?</P>
    <P>Something has happened since then that has changed that picture.  I ask Deputies to cast their minds back.  How stood the shopkeepers three years ago? How stood everyone in business three years ago and how stand they to-day? I ask anyone who knows anything about business, is it or is it not true that if you put an advertisement in a newspaper for a shop assistant three years ago you were lucky to get any reply at all?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> Is it, or is it not true, that if you put the same advertisement in to-day you will get 20 or 30 boys or girls replying.  What made the change I say I know.  I say that what made that change was the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil Government designed deliberately to effect that change, by the raising of the cost of money, the creation of credit stringency at a time of rising prices, the deliberate creation of internal price inflation which drove thousands into unemployment and more thousands into emigration and which as surely as we are standing in this House, is now advancing to the point where it will put in jeopardy the entire agricultural industry by destroying the margin of profit available to it by raising its costs of production higher than its markets will permit it to bear.</P>
    <P>I warn Dáil Éireann now, and let not Deputy Cowan say hereafter that he never heard the warning, that if that comes there will be precipitated in this country an economic disaster beside which the economic war will fade into insignificance.  Let us remember this &mdash;and again I do not want to go over ancient history&mdash;is it not approaching the point where there is too much being asked of Deputies outside the Fianna Fáil Party to build up the country after their civil war and then to build up the country again after their economic war and then, when they start again with a third assault on the people, to hand back direct to us a third time and say &ldquo;build it up again&rdquo;?  I warn this House and this country that, no matter how willing a horse may be, there are some burdens it cannot bear, and you cannot destroy a country three times in one generation and build it up again.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is travelling on the road of undermining the industry in this country on which every single creature in Ireland depends for existence&mdash;the agricultural industry.  I know that, with political cunning, they can create a situation which it will be virtually impossible for any popularly elected Government succeeding them to correct. I cannot bring myself to believe that any political Party in Ireland could conceivably be actuated by such criminal malice as to foresee their own <Col N="334" /> disintegration, and, foreseeing it, seek to create a situation that no successor could remedy.  When I ask myself this question, and when I look back on the Budget of 1952 and the debates on it, when I read anew the White Paper which was issued by the Minister for Finance in 1951 and when I see the course of conduct that developed from the publication of that accursed document, I ask myself the question: &ldquo;Why did he do it?&rdquo;  Why did he tear down the whole economic structure that we had erected whereunder wages had got abreast of the cost of living and were even rising a little above it, where there was stability of costs throughout the whole economy, where we had mobilised the Exchequer behind the cost of living so as to ensure its stability and where we had in reserve an ample fund to fall back on at any time if the credit authorities of the country proved unequal to their responsibility?</P>
    <P>Why, overnight, did he come in and sweep away that reserve and then find himself, six months later at his wit's end, rushing into the market to borrow in the name of Ireland and on the credit of an Irish Government at 5 per cent., while proclaiming, again and again before the world: &ldquo;We could not have raised one penny if we did not pay more than Southern Rhodesia: the Irish Republic could not have raised one penny if we did not pay more than the island of Jamaica?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why did he tear down the whole system of subsidies and the stabilisation of the cost of living, and throw the whole economic life of the country into the melting pot and precipitate rising costs and the hateful, dangerous price inflation that is strangling our economy now?</P>
    <P>The more I ask myself that question Why?  Why?  Why?,  the more impossible I find it to get an answer.  I wonder does he know himself?  I wonder if Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party have any idea in their minds, why did he do it.  I have tried to formulate a reason as to why he did.  When he began that course I said: &ldquo;He must be foreseeing the disappearance of Taoiseach de Valera and wants to see Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach with a surplus at his disposal at the beginning <Col N="335" /> of his period of office so that they can get off to a good start.&rdquo;  That was an explanation, but we arrived at the end of the year and actually realised a deficit.  Why did he do it? Does anybody say that the economic state of this country is sounder and better to-day than it was when we stood with £28,500,000 of money in reserve, and with no financial authority in this country ever daring to question our right to claim credit for the communty at rates of interest which the community could afford to pay.  I ask that question again: Why?  Why?  Why?</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer.  Think back then on the principles laid down by the present Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera when he thought the going was good.  Think how he scorned a majority of 14 or more in Dáil Éireann if a doubt could be raised about people being behind him.  Look at his majority now.  Think of the by-elections. Think of what Deputy Cowan said.  Think of what the Minister for Health and Social Welfare said.  They did not say: &ldquo;Deliver us from the ordeal of a general election.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;Deliver us from the ordeal of defeat in a general election.&rdquo;  Ask yourselves: can he claim that he has behind him the support of the people? Let Deputy Cowan's honest soul writhe in agony lest truth be violated or honour tarnished and then let him return nobly, courageously, fearlessly to do his duty and cut his throat by precipitating a general election.  Can you imagine his doing it, and if you cannot, I hope you are proud of the sheet anchor to which you so zealously cling.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's speech, stripped of its rhetoric, verbosity and ballyhoo was perhaps the most useful contribution made to this debate.  It is a good thing that those who are now allied to Fine Gael or may in future become allied to them should understand that the alliance carries with it not merely an obligation to work with Fine Gael for some limited programme but retrospective absolution for Fine Gael's past sins and acceptance of Fine Gael's justification for having sinned. They must do more than that.  When we were engaged in tearing down the country, according to Deputy Dillon, we had the active support and cooperation of many Deputies who are now sitting behind Deputy Dillon. They not merely must give Fine Gael retrospective absolution but they must themselves do penance for their own sin, their sin of association with us in doing the things that Deputy Dillon condemns; and perhaps if they are <Col N="338" /> humble and contrite enough Deputy Dillon will give them absolution also.</P>
      <P>They must go further even than that. If ever again in an emergency we are short of bread and need every possible grain of wheat to feed our people and some little group of ranchers in the Midlands refuse to break up their pastures to carry out a national obligation to grow wheat, they must agree that they are to be left alone, that it is a crime for the Government to put a tractor into the gateway and plough up the field to sow wheat to feed our people, if the ranchers can make more money in some other way.</P>
      <P>It was a great achievement for Fine Gael to have improved conditions during the three years in which they were in office as compared with those which they found in 1947 just at the end of the war.  We knew the fertility of our land had been exhausted during the war.  Twice during that period I had the responsibility of ordering Irish ships to sail across the Atlantic to Florida to procure cargoes of phosphate rock when we could not get them anywhere else, in the hope of being able to do something to maintain the fertility of the Irish land.  The <i>Irish Plane</i> sailed west and never was heard of again.  The <i>Irish Oak</i> sailed east with a cargo of phosphate rock and it was blown to the sky by a German submarine.</P>
      <P>It is true there was a loss of fertility in the land and if the war had gone on much longer the yield per acre would have fallen lower still.  It was a great achievement of the Coalition Government at a time when supplies were again freely available, when none of those war-time problems were lying on their desks, to get an increased yield per acre, to get restored other activities which had stopped during the war.  It would have happened if they went to sleep at their desks, which some of them probably did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked one question, to which he is entitled to an answer.  He asked why this motion was put down. When this Government was formed the Taoiseach gave an undertaking, because of certain statements which were made at that time by members of the Fine Gael Party and newspapers supporting the Fine Gael Party, that <Col N="339" /> there would not be a dissolution of the Dáil unless the Government was defeated on an issue of confidence.  By-elections have been recently held in which the Fianna Fáil candidates were not successful and we have been urged by the Fine Gael Party to dissolve the Dáil in contravention of that undertaking which we gave when the Government was formed.  We are adhering to our pledge.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why we do not propose to take that course and it is this: We think that the public are entitled to an opportunity of judging our policy when they can see its full results, that it will take more time than has been available to us so far to demonstrate that our policy is capable of paying off in substantial benefits to the community.  We think it is fair to them, if they are to judge upon that policy, that they should know exactly the extent of the benefits which it can confer, in our opinion, on the country. These benefits are only now coming to hand.</P>
    <P>Behind a lot of the ballyhoo in this debate, there is keen appreciation of political interests.  Not merely do we think it is fair to the community that they should have an opportunity of estimating the extent of these benefits before judging on our policy, we think it is only fair to ourselves also.  The Opposition Party are just as alive to that situation as we are.  They know that we had to follow a course of action which was liable to be misunderstood, capable of being misrepresented, certainly unpopular in some of its aspects and which could not produce substantial benefits to the country until this year.  They are naturally anxious to get an election, if they can, while the memory of the hardships is fresh in the people's mind and the benefits are not yet sufficiently obvious.</P>
    <P>That is natural enough.  I do not blame the Party opposite for seeking to take any advantage they can in that way.  It is natural for any political Party to seek to obtain power.  If it has any purpose for its existence at all, it must aim to get into a position <Col N="340" /> where it can put into effect the ideas which are common to its members and to implement which the Party was organised.</P>
    <P>What are the ideas of the Fine Gael Party?  Is the Fine Gael Party seeking to obtain power to put into effect some ideas and plans and principles of its own and, if so, what are they, or are all the things that they may do after an election to be determined then in discussion with the members of other Parties associated with them?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said on a public occasion last week that Fine Gael will get back at another election into the old Cumann na nGaedheal position, as the predominant political Party in the country.  Many of those who took the action which made these hopes now possible for Fine Gael must be as concerned as I am to know what they will do in that position if they get there. Fine Gael was a dying Party in 1947. The responsibility of those who then went into alliance with them in 1948 was that they revied Fine Gael, brought it into a position in which it can hope now to get again into the old Cumann na nGaedheal position, as the predominant political Party of the country.</P>
    <P>I think those who took the responsibility of reviving Fine Gael and who are still helping them forward into that predominant position are entitled to get from them some indication of what they intend to do if they get there. Was Deputy Dillon's speech an indication? I assume that the Leaders of Fine Gael will be asked that by some of their present allies and I do not think the answer can be kept a secret. The people will ask it.  Certainly, so long as I have any voice left, I will keep on asking.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the by-elections.  It is quite true that the result of the by-elections weakened the Government.  Apart from any other effect, we lost a seat. A seat which was held by the Fianna Fáil Party at the general election is now held by a Fine Gael Deputy.  That is two votes less available to the Government on a division in the House.</P>
      <P>There is this to be said also about the by-elections, that they did not indicate any alteration in the representation of these constituencies at a future general election.  If there was a general election to-morrow, East Cork and Wicklow would return the same representation as in 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, if you go over the whole six by-elections that took place during the lifetime of this Dáil, the only one that suggested there might be a different position in a general election was North Mayo and that suggested that we might gain a seat but I am not putting that forward in order to minimise the effect of the by-elections upon the Government. The Government, quite obviously, has not succeeded in convincing a majority of the people in these constituencies that we are working on the right lines. We may convince them yet.  We have not done it up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not expect that we would have been able to bring about such a swing of opinion in these constituencies that we could have won the seats there. When we embarked upon the programme that we are now following we fully appreciated the fact that we were incurring grave political risks, that for a period of a year or two the changes which we thought it necessary to bring about to improve the economic and social conditions of the country might mean a temporary loss of support amongst the public.  It would have been too much, we realised, to hope that the mass of the people would understand fully the need for these measures or foresee clearly the benefits <Col N="342" /> they would ultimately confer upon them.  We knew, as I said on another occasion, that at any time during those two years, the incidence of mortality or sickness amongst Deputies supporting the Government could have deprived us of office and, consequently, of the opportunity of demonstrating that we were working on the right lines.  We would have dodged the risk if we could.  We could not see any method of doing so.  We realised that if we were to work conscientiously and effectively we had to proceed on the basis of a long-term plan.  That long-term plan is now, I think, beginning to pay off in substantial benefits to the community, in increased production and the prospect of increased employment. We have a long way to go yet before conditions will be such as we would like to see them, conditions such as we expect to have them, but the movement is in the right direction. It is still too slow, still too hesitant, but the direction is right.</P>
    <P>One other comment on the by-elections should be made.  It is, of course, completely nonsensical to argue that the Government should not hold office unless it has the support of a majority of the electorate in every constituency. No Government in the world could accept that situation.  When a general election is held, a Party may do well in some constituencies and not so well in others.  The net result of the election means that a Government is formed with the support of a majority of the Deputies elected, a Government which might not have a Deputy supporting it from some constituency but which nevertheless would be constitutionally entitled to act as the Government of the State so long as it was supported by a majority of the Dáil. We did not get a majority of the Deputies elected in East Cork in the last election to support us and the same was true of some other constituencies where there have been by-elections. The swing of opinion such as it is against the Government consequent on the measures which the Government had to take will, I am certain, be reversed, and perhaps when the swing in the other direction comes it will be greater in its effect.</P>
    <P>We have been told here that the <Col N="343" /> policy of the Government has produced misery and hardship amongst the people and that that misery and hardship follows on the level of taxation, the level of prices and unemployment. That is something that is very easy to say, but it is almost meaningless unless it is supported by some attempt at proof.  When one talks about the level of taxes being too high or the level of prices being too high one must be thinking of some basis of comparison, either a comparision with conditions in other countries or a comparison with conditions such as might conceivably exist here.</P>
    <P>So far as a comparison with conditions in other countries is concerned there is no basis for the contention.  Taking our nearest neighbour, Britain, the country in Europe where social conditions are more or less akin to our own, the percentage of the national income taken for public administration is 40 as compared with 27 here.  We take less of the national income for public purposes than the British do.</P>
    <P>That is not the whole answer, I admit, if any Deputy argues that the level of taxation is still too high because the national income is not large enough to permit of the balance left for public spending to sustain a reasonable standard of life.  So far as the level of prices is concerned, largely speaking, our prices are lower than in Britain and I think lower than in most European coutries.  That may not be true of all commodities, but taking the general level of prices it is true.  When, however, Deputies say that the level of taxation is too high, that prices are too high, do they not accept the obligation to say what can be done about it? In the course of this debate there did not come from one responsible leader of the other Parties opposite a positive suggestion as to what action should be taken to bring down taxation or to bring down prices.  You cannot bring down taxation except you bring down expenditure.  What expenditure will the Deputies opposite urge should be curtailed?  What services now provided by the Government should in their view be abandoned?  In what way do they think it is possible for the <Col N="344" /> Government to reduce expenditure and thereby permit of a reduction of taxation?  If they have any ideas on that subject why keep them to themselves? The public will expect them to give that indication as evidence of their good faith, and if the Fianna Fáil Party should continue in the Government any good ideas which the Opposition may put forward will be considered.  What purpose have they in keeping secret any ideas of that kind that they have in their minds? What do they think can be done to bring down prices?  In what particular way do they think it is possible to bring down the price of any commodity that enters into the calculation of the cost-of-living index figure?</P>
    <P>The price of butter has been frequently mentioned here.  The price of butter is bound up with the price of milk.  Butter sells in the shops at 4/2 per lb. retail.  The farmer who supplies the milk to make that butter gets 1/6 a gallon.  It takes 2½ gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  That is to say that of that 4/2, 3/9 represents the price paid to the farmer for his milk. The balance of 5d. covers the cost of manufacture of milk into butter, packing and distributing it to the retail shops and selling it retail to the consumer. There can be no reduction in the price of butter except by the application of a subsidy or by a reduction in the price of milk.  Do Deputies opposite think that the price of milk should be reduced?  I know that Deputy Dillon at one time urged that it was in the interest of the creamery farmers to commit themselves for five years to accept 1/- per gallon for their milk.</P>

      <P>That proposal was turned down by the creamery suppliers and he did not go on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My question is a simple one.  Do the Deputies opposite think that the price paid for creamery milk should be reduced? Do they, on the other hand, contemplate any reduction in the price of butter by the application of a subsidy? To bring down the price by one penny would involve a subsidy of £1,000,000 per year.  To make any significant reduction in the price of <Col N="345" /> butter would, therefore, involve a subsidy of several million pounds&mdash;from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 according to the reduction sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A penny in the gallon on milk means £1,000,000 of taxation which is a different problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot reduce the price of butter to any great extent except by a subsidy which is going to run into a very large sum.  I do not want to argue on figures at all.  I want to argue on principles.  If the sum is a large one it must be provided either by increasing some taxes or by cutting some present expenditure.  Details are required if that is what is contemplated. Any significant reduction in the cost-of-living index number by way of subsidies would involve a very large sum of money indeed which would have to be paid year after year, a permanent burden upon the Exchequer of the State, depriving it of revenue which could conceivably be used for other purposes.  I argued this question of subsidies in the knowledge that I did not always hold that view.  I was, perhaps, more responsible than any other individual for the introduction of these subsidies in 1947, and might I remind Deputy Dillon that when they were introduced in 1947, he voted against them and the whole Fine Gael Party voted against them.  This Party which is criticising the Government for abandoning subsidies did their best in 1947 to prevent them ever being introduced.  I argued with my colleagues then in favour of a policy of food subsidies in the belief that we were facing in that year a temporary rise in prices, in the belief that prices were going to move up to a peak because of the abnormal conditions prevailing in that year, conditions due mainly to the weather which operated in that year, and that in the following year the prices would fall again and that the only thing we had to do was to carry prices over that peak and that <Col N="346" /> prices would come down to the previous level in the following year and the subsidies would disappear and no continuing problem would result.</P>
      <P>It did not work out that way.  Prices went up and stayed up, and when they did show a tendency to come down in 1949 the Korean war situation came along and boosted them up further. We recognise in this situation that we have to regard the present price level as more or less permanent.  In the course of the recent by-elections I did not attempt to promise in any of my addresses that the prices of commodities coming into the cost of living calculation would come down.  I pointed out that the prices of these commodities are in the main based on the prices paid to Irish farmers, and that while those prices were relatively good they operated to redress a situation in the economy of this country, a situation which prevailed before the war that we regarded as undesirable, in which the return received from investment or work in agriculture was considerably lower than that obtainable from any other occupation.  That was a bad condition for a country predominantly agricultural.  We tried then to redress the balance in favour of agriculture and it has been redressed now, and we think it would be a thoroughly retrograde step to bring down agricultural prices to reduce food prices in the towns.  It is far better to seek to amend the rates of remuneration and the other circumstances prevailing in the towns so that they are related to the level of agricultural prices, than that the relative position of agriculture should be worsened. That is my view.  For that reason my aim has been, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, supervising the price controlling machinery, to get to the position in which I think we are now, the position in which one could hold out the prospect of price stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see, and I do not like to prophesy in a matter of this kind, no further general price increase in the commodities which affect the cost-of-living index number is likely to take place in the foreseeable future.  If there is a qualification which must be put to that, it relates to the one commodity <Col N="347" /> which is still subsidised, wheat. We have signed a new wheat agreement, under which the maximum price which we may have to pay for imported wheat is higher than the old one.</P>
    <P>Whether that maximum price will be effective during the life of the agreement I do not know.  We decided that it was in our interest to sign that agreement, having regard to our relatively weak position as an international wheat buyer.  The British decided to take an alternative course and did not sign the agreement.  I do not think the net result will be that we will do worse than they, in the price we have to pay for imported wheat.  If I can offer an opinion regarding the future level of prices, knowing that wheat situation, it is because so long as there is a subsidy provided from the Exchequer to wheat prices, the price to be charged to the consumer for flour and bread is a matter of Government decision primarily.</P>
    <P>So far as industrial commodities are concerned, there has been a definite movement downwards.  Whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of opinion.  We have seen during recent weeks a reduction in the price of timber, cement, petrol, fertilisers, binder twine and a number of industrial commodities.  I have already expressed to the Dáil my fear that anticipation among the business community of a fall in prices would slow down trade and that it would be better if the price position were clearly recognised to be stabilised.  I think this recent fall in prices was merely an adjustment from an abnormal situation, that the commodities to which I referred were unduly inflated in price by exceptional demands during the Korean war period and that they are not likely to fall much further.  In fact, the most significant thing in recent weeks is that certain commodities, like steel, have begun to move up again. In any event, I will make no further prognostication, except that we are in a general position of stable prices and that unless there is a further international upheaval, that is likely to persist. That is the ideal situation for progress.  It means that anyone starting <Col N="348" /> a new business, an industrial or a commercial enterprise, which will not get into production for 12 months or two years ahead, can be reasonably certain that his present estimate of costs will prove accurate, that rising prices in the interval will not upset the estimate.  He can also be reasonably certain that someone coming into the business later will not have a competitive advantage over him by reason of lower costs.  It is because we have suceeded in getting into a situation in which it is possible to forecast with some accuracy that there will be no further general increase in prices and no further general increase in taxes that the hope of accelerating economic expansion can be held out.  That is taking place.</P>
    <P>So far as manufacturing industry is concerned, the type of economic activity for which I as Minister for Industry and Commerce am responsible, that is going ahead apace.  Expansion is occurring in quite a number of directions.  Almost every second week now, some new factory opens somewhere, or there is published in the newspapers a prospectus from some company raising capital to finance some new enterprise.  My concern in that regard is not whether progress will continue but whether we can direct that progress in the way in which we would wish.  We introduced last year the Undeveloped Areas Act, which gave us power to hold out inducements to new industrialists to go to counties west of the Shannon.  The report of the board that administers that Act for 1952 is about to be published. They will report that they have approved of 15 projects and that there are about 12 others in a position in which approval is likely to be forthcoming.  Of the 15 projects, about 12 will go ahead.  It is, I think, a not unsatisfactory result for the first year during which the Act was in operation, 12 new industrial concerns in those counties which were industrially undeveloped previously.  The intimidating thing is that there are at present some 35 new industrial concerns about to start in Dublin, concerns which we in some cases endeavoured to induce west of the Shannon and the promoters of which considered that the <Col N="349" /> economic advantage of starting here in Dublin outweighed any help we could give in a western location.  No doubt, the development of industry west of the Shannon will itself promote further development there and the activities which the Government is undertaking in that area, in the bog development in North Mayo, in the production of electricity from peat, the new power stations planned in Donegal and Galway and Clare and Kerry, will all help to accelerate the movement of industry to the West in the course of time.</P>
    <P>The development of industry is going on, but we are still getting this situation in which the growth of the eastern cities and towns is proceeding more rapidly than we would wish. That is having the continual effect of attracting into them workers from rural areas and sometimes from rural employment, although there is an unemployment problem still there.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the possibility that every measure we take to increase employment in Dublin will have the effect of bringing more workers into Dublin instead of reducing the number of unemployed here.  At one time we had a rule that employment upon certain State-financed schemes was confined to people who had been normally resident in Dublin for a year or two years or more.  It is not the type of rule that a Government likes to make, but it is a rule which I think might be revived in connection with any public works schemes undertaken for the purpose of reducing the employment problem which is here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have said that in relation to taxes the position of stability that has been reached gives us the prospect of planning ahead with greater confidence; that in respect of prices the position of stability that has been reached is not likely to change one way or another for some time.  The outstanding problem still is unemployment.  I am not going to argue about unemployment upon the basis of what one Government did or another Government did. It is quite obvious to me that the conditions which continue to produce unemployment in Ireland are fundamental and that we have to get down to them <Col N="350" /> in a fundamental way if the position is to be created in which we can guarantee reasonably constant employment to all our available workers.  There is certainly no foundation for the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that we have any idea that it is a good thing for the country to have a pool of unemployed labour.  Any such idea would be contrary to the outlook we have held all our lives, to every plan and every project that the Fianna Fáil Government during the whole of its existence produced to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We accept as evidence that the work we have done has not been wide enough in its scope or pushed ahead as vigorously as it should have been, the fact that there is still a number of unemployed workers who cannot be absorbed into production or useful occupations at the present state of the country's economic development.  So long as that evidence is there, evidence that our activities are not vigorous enough or moving fast enough, then we will endeavour to widen their scope and speed them up.  That is the spur we are prepared to apply to ourselves in carrying out our ideas and plans in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have naturally considered the situation resulting from the recent by-elections. We realise that even if we get this vote of confidence carried by the Dáil the majority normally available to support the Government's programme during the next two years will be narrow and that at any time during that period the mere accidental absence of some Deputies or the incidence of illness might make it impossible for us to go on.  Nevertheless, we decided to try to go on. We think that it is not merely in our political interests to let the country see the benefits of the work we have done in concrete form but it is in the country's interests that the plans and projects we have prepared for the past two years for development in various directions should be brought into operation.  We hope to get, frankly, for most of these plans and projects in so far as they require approval here, the support of many more Deputies than will vote for us on this vote of confidence.  We are certain when these matters come before the Dáil as individual <Col N="351" /> measures that they will command the support of Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The political problem of the Government is very largely confined to the votes that occur periodically on motions of a general kind or Estimates where no particular projects are under debate but the general policy of the Government.  While there will always be risks associated with these votes, nevertheless we are confident that we can get a useful programme of work completed before anything will arise to upset it.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why there has been a change of attitude on our part as compared with that of 1947, the attitude which Deputy Dillon illustrated by those quotations of his from speeches made by the Taoiseach then.  On various occasions in the past, when by-elections indicated some reason for it, the Dáil has been dissolved and a general election held. In fact the first general election I fought as a member of the Dáil was in 1927 when the Fine Gael Party dissolved the Dáil after winning two by-elections. They subsequently lost several, but they did not dissolve the Dáil then.</P>
    <P>I am coming to the point of view that, under normal circumstances and under P.R., there is a law which operates to keep the number of supporters of a Government and the number of opponents of a Government more or less in balance.  I have been watching the course of events in other European countries and everywhere P.R. is in operation there is always a very close margin between the Government in office and the Opposition, and I do not think that is just a coincidence or an accidental outcome of unusual circumstances in these countries.  I think there is a law that operates to produce that result, that there is a tendency to weaken the strong Party and to build up the weak one, and that we are facing a situation for a long time ahead when every Government in office here will hold office on a narrow margin of votes.  Consequently, anything we do now may constitute a precedent.  We <Col N="352" /> consider that the precedent should be that a Government elected after a general election by the votes of a majority of Deputies should continue in office and endeavour to carry through the programme to which it is committed until some of those whose votes gave it authority to hold office withdraw that support permanently and vote with the Opposition, thus creating a situation in which the Government can no longer claim to have the support of a majority of Deputies.</P>
    <P>If we have a situation in which every time a Government loses a by-election there has to be a general election, there will be no progress at all.  It would be an impossible situation in any State and a ridiculous one in ours because, apart from any situation which might develop in the Dáil, it has been obvious for a number of years past that political opinion amongst the people of this country is more or less evenly divided on the merits and demerits of the Fianna Fáil Party.  So that, even though temporary or local circumstances may occasion a small swing of votes in some constituencies, there is not likely to be a fundamental change, nor will there be until some new fundamental issue arises which may occasion a new alignment of the individuals now engaged in politics.  For that reason I think we have to establish this precedent, that a Government when elected with a programme to fulfil should not cease to work to carry through that programme so long as it has a majority, however narrow, in the Legislature, to support it.</P>
    <P>If we thought things were going wrong, if we thought that there might be difficulties in the future which would be beyond our capacity to cope, if we thought that economic conditions were going to get worse, we might be tempted to listen to the urgings of Deputies opposite to quit office so as to avoid the responsibility for the bad things we saw ahead.  It is because we do not see bad things ahead, because we see improvements, a reduction of unemployment, an expansion of industry and an increase of the resources available to the community to tackle social problems that <Col N="353" /> we are anxious to work in that situation, believing that we have the ideas and the plans and the capacity to do good work in it.</P>
    <P>If there is a majority of the Dáil prepared to back our faith to that extent&mdash;we do not ask them to do more than that; we do not ask them to surrender any right to criticise any particular project or plan that we may propose&mdash;then we will go on.  If there is not such a majority, that is a situation which we must accept.  But we felt it was our duty as a Government to bring this issue to the Dáil, to declare to the Dáil our willingness to carry on in this situation and to produce here in time the proposals we are preparing if the Dáil wants to see them.  We accept the sovereignty of the Dáil and we will abide by its decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It might possibly have saved a great deal of wasted effort if, instead of the motion being moved by the Taoiseach, it had been moved by the Tánaiste.  Whatever difference of opinion we have with the Tánaiste, at least he has one very good ability and that is to speak about real politics and real issues.  The motion before the House is not only a simple one but it is one that, frankly, I can see no objection to the Government putting down.  I do not intend going into the question of the significance of the by-election figures.  In every game there are rules and one is entitled to take full advantage of the rules.  Perhaps after utilising the rules and failing, you may have to pay the penalty, but you are still entitled to play the game according to the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules at the moment are that the Government are in office on the basis of certain support given to them in this House and they are entitled to remain in office so long as they can secure that support.  Whether, as Deputy Dillon suggests, the people are no longer giving the same volume of support to the Government as they did in the 1951 General Election is another matter which possibly will be decided on some occasion.  But in a debate of this character it is just as well we should all be frank.  I <Col N="354" /> have no doubt that if Fine Gael were the Government to-day, or the Labour Party, and were in the same position, we would probably hold out as long as we could.  I am not objecting to that, but what I am concerned with is not why the Government put down the vote of confidence but rather whose confidence they are looking for.  In this House we have two main political Parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We have the Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and Independents, and one by one, any member of the House can go through that assembly, can set down in advance what are likely to be the votes on this motion of confidence. There is no use in me arguing to convince members of Fianna Fáil they should vote against their own Government; very little use in the Tánaiste trying to convince members of the Fine Gael Party to vote for the motion. He probably would expect a good deal of difficulty in convincing the Labour Party at the moment that we should vote for him, although I do not think that it is beyond his powers to try to do it.  He came very near that this evening.  The same position applies in regard to the farmers' Party and Clann na Poblachta.</P>
    <P>We are left with a number of Independents, and we can break them down until we are left with the residue, and it is this residue whose position is under discussion to-night, not the position of the Government or Fine Gael or the Labour Party&mdash;it is the position of a number of Independent Deputies.  Again, among the Independent Deputies, the position is fairly clear, in so far as a Deputy like Deputy Sheldon is concerned.  His position is quite clear.  I can understand it.  To me, he is a person in politics who has a conservative outlook, and I do not see very much common ground between us or think that my arguments would carry very much weight with him.</P>
    <P>The same applies to Deputy Cogan. I doubt if on any question Deputy Cogan and myself will find much to agree on, although for a short period of three years we did find peace, and it was not our side that changed its views, but Deputy Cogan did.  Deputy McQuillan is a member of this House <Col N="355" /> with sufficient independence to make up his own mind and I do not know what way he is going to do it, although I might have a fairly good idea.  Finally, we are left with the three most interesting figures in the House at the moment.  I am sure Deputy Cowan will take a pride in that position&mdash; Deputy Captain Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll. As far as Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll is concerned, he is a very nice, gentlemanly man, but I do not think he is going to take a decision of himself.  He will largely decide with Deputy Dr. Browne.  So that, after all our discussions to-night so far as the vote of confidence is concerned, the future existence of the Government depends on Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest again for a moment that they are not entitled to their viewpoints and to cast their votes in any way they will.  They have as much right as I have, or any other member of the House, to do so, but they have also the same responsibility of accounting for their votes.  That is where frankly I am meeting with a certain amount of difficulty.  I appreciate the solicitude expressed by Deputies Dr. Browne and Cowan for the Labour Party.  Perhaps, when we go a little further and examine the record we can check that solicitude.  But in so far as their position as Independent Deputies is concerned we are entitled to try and find on what basis they are going to give this confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, in the course of his speech, addressed a number of very pointed questions to the Taoiseach asking for certain assurances or rather seemed to convey he had given these assurances but before that he had already committed himself to vote.  That may have been the way his speech was formulated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan followed the same example when he asked the Taoiseach to regard the present position regarding unemployment as of an emergency character and then proceeded to say that he would vote for the motion.  I do not think anything <Col N="356" /> I would say would have the slightest influence in changing their minds and I do not want to say they are not free to change their minds, but I do think we are entitled to check those statements they have made in the House against what they have committed themselves to.  Both of these Deputies, like others of us here, were supporters of the inter-Party Government, and I would suggest that they might not merely give advice to the Labour Party but ponder the course followed by the Labour Party over a number of years.</P>
    <P>In passing, I want to make this comment.  Deputy Dr. Browne was not merely a supporter of the inter-Party Government like myself and other back benchers.  He was a Minister. He claimed that his main concern and chief solicitude was for health.  For that we give him credit, but whether he likes it or not&mdash;and one of the first to impose that requirement on him was Fianna Fáil&mdash;as a member of the inter-Party Cabinet he did not merely carry responsibility for health, but he carried the same weight of responsibility as any other member of that Cabinet whether Fine Gael or Labour or Independent. I have never criticised Deputy Dr. Browne for the difficulties he got into at that time.  I have a good deal of understanding of them and I admit more knowledge of them than probably most members of this House but I do submit to Deputy Dr. Browne that he cannot on the one hand claim all the credit as Minister for Health and at the same time as a member of the inter-Party Government Cabinet, repudiate responsibility for whatever else went wrong.  That is what he is trying to do.  His criticism of the inter-Party Cabinet was that as Minister for Health he did not receive the support he was entitled to.  Presumably one of his colleagues was Deputy Norton, then Minister for Social Welfare.  In the course of his speech, Deputy Dr. Browne commented on the delay during the inter-Party Government's time in introducing social welfare.  If Deputy Norton carried responsibility for giving support or not to Deputy Dr. Browne, does not Deputy Dr. Browne carry responsibility for failing <Col N="357" /> to support Deputy Norton on social welfare?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supported the inter-Party Government.  We knew what we were doing.  We are not making any excuses and we are taking the good with the bad; but Deputy Dr. Browne wants to take only the good and throw the bad back.  That is only a passing comment because it arises rather later in regard to his attitude towards Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>What is more interesting is that in this House we have, as I say, two main political Parties.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, made a very interesting comment in the course of his speech when he indicated his views as to the possible future facing the Government of this country for some years when he said he expected they would hold office by very narrow majorities.  We are in a period of political flux in this country.  Most of the Parties in the Dáil do not want to be members of an inter-Party Government.  Fianna Fáil want to hold office as a single Party.  Fine Gael want the same and so do Labour and Clann na Talmhan, and so on.  That is a normal fact of political life but we have a situation now, where, in my opinion, none of us is going to be gratified by that very happy result.  And in the vote on this motion, it is not merely a question so far as these two Parties are concerned &mdash;and they have made it quite clear&mdash; of making their decision as to whether or not they will keep Fianna Fáil in the Government.  They are all very much concerned as to what will replace Fianna Fáil when Fianna Fáil goes out.</P>
    <P>That is a very fair question: the Labour Party has had the same problem in the past.  Speakers from this Party in the course of the present debate stated, what has been stated on many occasions before, that there were periods when there were much closer contacts and closer relations between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil.  It is good to know that during those periods the great programme to which the Minister for Health referred to-night was accomplished.  I do not want to pursue that point now beyond saying that there was that close relationship but at one period it broke.  It broke for the simple reason that while <Col N="358" /> it may seem to be very simple to say that you will vote in support of a certain Party when they are becoming the Government, once you do that, whether you like it or not, you are a prisoner and it is not easy to break loose, particularly if you have to sit in the Chamber and hear for the first time what they propose to do in regard to any particular problem.  Then you have to decide in the House, practically without any consultation, what you are going to do about it.  I think the same problem faces Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne at the present moment.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the Labour Party made a certain decision.  That decision was not expected by Fianna Fáil.  Possibly they thought that after such a long period of the Labour Party's trying to exercise, if you like, an influence on the Fianna Fáil Government in the direction of Labour Party policy, that a good part of that policy ran on parallel lines to the Fianna Fáil policy. They thought after that long period that if the whip was cracked we came to heel or else we went into the wilderness. If they thought that we might decide to change in our approach to these matters there might be a different attitude on the part of Fianna Fáil. They evidently thought that the gap between Fine Gael and the Labour Party was so wide that it was not possible to bridge it, on the basis of sentiments which seem to indicate that under no circumstances would we have an association with Fine Gael.  The people however who closed that gap were the Fianna Fáil Party themselves and nobody else, because you can put so much pressure and no more, on the working classes, particularly on the organised sections of the working classes.  In 1947, whether Fianna Fáil appreciated it or not, they put too much pressure on us and they forced us to follow a path that, possibly, normally we would not have contemplated. That resulted in the formation of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat amused when I listen to Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan now castigating us for what they call our excessive loyalty to the inter-Party Government.  Was there anyone more loyal or more abject <Col N="359" /> in his adulation of one of the members of the inter-Party Government with whom we probably had the greatest difficulty, than Deputy Cowan?  I refer to Deputy Cowan's attitude to Deputy Dillon.  Even when I was sitting on the same benches as Deputy Cowan, as a supporter of the inter-Party Government, I had sometimes frankly an uneasy feeling when I listened to him speaking in the way he did of Deputy Dillon.  I have no objection to Deputy Cowan paying tribute to Deputy Dillon; he was quite entitled to do it but it was the form and the measure of that tribute that sometimes astonished me.</P>
    <P>During that period Deputy Cowan once gave expression to the opinion&mdash; no doubt he thought it an honest opinion&mdash;that Deputy Dillon was the greatest Minister for Agriculture we had in this country so far.  Possibly that is right; I do not know.  I have never professed to be an expert on agriculture but then when you have Deputy Cowan coming along later and giving us this gratuitous advice as to what we should do to save the Labour Party, it is getting a little heavy. Whether or not Deputy Cowan wishes it, the Labour Party will be always there because there is in the social and economic framework of the country a basis for a Labour Party.  Perhaps some of us may make mistakes from time to time; we are merely human in that respect but we shall pass on and others will take our place.  It might be no harm to point out that the Labour Party is the oldest Party in this country, with the longest continous record in the public life of this country.  The Labour Party, as I say, will always be there and the mistakes we make to-day will be corrected by those who come after us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan was a member of the Labour Party and he left the Labour Party because it was not sufficiently militant for him.  He went out of it with the object of organising a propagandist body which would be a channel through which people would be led into the Labour Party.  It was a very good idea; I did not see much wrong with it.  I think that all of us in political life at times feel that we are being restricted <Col N="360" /> by the ordinary ties of Party membership and that outside a Party we could get more scope for our activities than would normally be possible inside the Party owing to the necessity of getting a common consensus of opinion within that political group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan helped to build the Labour Party and to make it stronger. He organised a certain movement.  I am not mentioning it in any critical fashion but the organisation was not a success although it was very much to the left of the Labour Party.  Having failed there, for reasons which are not important at the moment, he did not come back to the Labour Party; instead he moved into Clann na Poblachta.</P>
    <P>It is as well that we should say these things in public because this is an important debate.  Clann na Poblachta came into public life in this country, not with any very original programme of its own.  Most of it, I think, would be found in the old programme of the Labour Party.  The trouble with some people is that the name of the Labour Party creates certain difficulties for them.  A lot of people do not like to be known as members of the Labour Party.  It is not quite respectable enough for them if they have got to hob-nob with people who wear &ldquo;sugáns&rdquo; around their knees.  Deputy Cowan went into Clann na Poblachta and went out of it after a time.  He is entitled to do what he likes but he has gone the full circle&mdash;from Labour to the Vanguard, from the Vanguard to Clann na Poblachta and from Clann na Poblachta to the Independents.  Now he and his colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne, are the people to whom we are addressing this debate to-night.</P>

      <P>I could understand that if Deputy Cowan was not a person who claimed to have a certain fairly definite economic and social outlook.  I would be interested to know where is the common ground between Deputy Cowan and the Fianna Fáil Party. Fianna Fáil has repeatedly in recent years emphasised particularly its acceptance of private enterprise as the basis of its economic and industrial policy <Col N="361" /> in this country.  I doubt very much if Deputy Cowan and myself accept that but Deputy Cowan finds it possible to support Fianna Fáil.  I do not.  Deputy Cowan will agree with me that one of the basic problems we have at the moment, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party that holds office, is by what means we are going to obtain the necessary financial resources to carry through any policy of development in this country.  Both he and I will agree that the private interests who, at the moment, appear to be able to control and direct these financial resources in their own interest, should not be allowed to put their private interests before the public welfare.  Fianna Fáil does not agree with that.</P>

      <P>We shall come to Fine Gael in a moment.  After all, you were with them just as well as I was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall explain that in a moment.  Deputy Cowan, like myself, was one of those who during the period of the inter-Party Government exerted very great pressure to use to the utmost the power of the State in respect to price control, spanceling prices, establishing the Prices Advisory Body and adopting all possible measures which we thought at that time were needed.  Fianna Fáil have scrapped 160 price control Orders, emasculated the prices tribunal and, so far as prices are concerned, they are not going to get any more attention from the Government.  That was accepted by Deputy Cowan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like myself, Deputy Cowan is concerned with regard to prices.  I may be wrong but I think he accepts, as I do, that in the present circumstances, and particularly in the circumstances of 1951 and preceding years, whether the subsidy was a good principle or not, because of the possible effects of removing subsidies, they had to be maintained in the interests of the <Col N="362" /> ordinary people.  I think that is not an unfair statement to make so far as Deputy Cowan is concerned.  Certainly, that is my view.  But Fianna Fáil have removed the subsidies.  The arguments that Fianna Fáil made in support of removing those subsidies had been made many times in this House before the inter-Party went out of office but Deputy Cowan and myself and the Labour Party did not accept them.  We still persisted in requiring that the subsidies would be maintained.  Even up to the present moment, the Labour Party has committed itself so far as possible to restore them.  Deputy Cowan is now supporting the Party that removed them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and myself are concerned with unemployment.  When I raise these points I want it to be clear that I am not raising them in order to suggest that Deputy Cowan is not sincere in his beliefs.  I am accepting it that he is.  What is puzzling me is how he has arrived where he is to-day. The whole purpose of this debate is not for the benefit of the electors outside the House, neither is it for the benefit of the membership of the House generally: it is solely being directed to these few Independent members and they are carrying the responsibility of the decision.  That is why it is that, whether or not we believe in their sincerity when they make their statements, in order to examine them we have to accept them.  In many ways, I accept the statements of Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne as being quite sincere but I am at a loss to follow them along the particular path they are pursuing at the moment. We have the same common concern on unemployment.  That, in effect, means that they believe in full employment. I wonder whether they accept the full implications of that.  However, it still does not alter the fact that the policy they have pursued since 1951 has created unemployment and, in my opinion, it was avoidable and unnecessary unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have very strong doubts&mdash;which, along with other members, I stated in this House before&mdash;as to whether the policy adopted in 1951 in respect of the Budget, and repeated again in 1952, <Col N="363" /> had not merely the whole-hearted support of the Tánaiste but of many members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  But it has got the whole-hearted support of Deputy Cowan.  At least, it appears so to-night.  That was the policy which was laid down for the edification of the Fianna Fáil Government in the report of the Central Bank.  Even though that report was publicly repudiated by the Tánaiste, in particular, and other members of the Government, the notable fact is that what that report asked for has been given. That is important.  The policy in that report is exactly the same economic policy as was put forward and accepted by the Conservative Government in Britain.  I am not suggesting that our Government have followed the Conservative Government in Britain but if you start out with certain common views on economics you generally arrive at the same end.</P>
    <P>The misfortune I see in regard to Fianna Fáil is this.  In 1927 and in 1931 the Tánaiste was speaking of nationalising industry and speaking in terms that were, at that time, even too advanced for the Labour Party.  So far as policy is concerned, Fianna Fáil have now reached the position in which they have displaced Fine Gael so far as their economic outlook is concerned. No more clear indication of that can be found than in the fact that, whether or not they agreed or accepted the report of the Central Bank, after two years of office, we are in the position which the Central Bank said was very desirable for this country&mdash;subsidies gone, a gap between wages and the cost of living, strict balancing of Budgets (the Minister for Finance has still to find £3,500,000), the pool of unemployed and a much more critical attitude towards such questions as local government works, housing, and so forth.  It may be accidental.  It may be, as the Tánaiste said it was, a policy that was necessary and desirable. It still does not alter the coincident, as they say in American films, that, starting from two different points, the Central Bank, the Fianna Fáil Government, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne all arrived at the <Col N="364" /> same point.  These are the decision that I am interested in.  The reason why I mention them is because there is the very practical difficulty that, when a smaller political Party or group in this House is trying to put forward its own point of view, to pursue its own independent way, it can very easily find itself holding on to the tail of the cat and not being able to let go.</P>
    <P>There was a leader in the <i>Irish Press</i> last week in which they discussed the future of the Labour Party.  It was a very interesting article.  It spoke of the two-Party system in this country and, if one read between the lines, it was not unreasonable to draw the conclusion that so far as the writer of that article was concerned his view was that if there could not be a single Party Government made up of Fianna Fáil then the next best thing would be a single Party Government made up of Fine Gael.  I wonder if that is the view of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It is a very pertinent question.  On one occasion, I think in 1947, the position of the Labour Party was being discussed.  Some of the leaders of Fianna Fáil were kind enough to say that they believed that the Labour Party should have representation in the Dáil but purely as a convenient section which, when Fianna Fáil required votes, would be able to furnish them but that they should not get ambitious to expand beyond a very limited section with a very limited appeal.  I have no doubt that Fine Gael have the same view.  We all believe that our own Party would be better able to run the Government than any other Party.  I have no doubt that, while Fine Gael are not unfriendly to us at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy Mulcahy has, on occasion, expressed his preference for what he regarded as an inter-Party Government.  I think that that was due possibly to the passing <Col N="365" /> circumstances of the present time with its political uncertainty.  Quite frankly, I think that, from the point of view of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, it would be unwise for them to desire anything else except sole responsibility. If the Labour Party were in a position to form a Government on its own, I do not see any reason why we should associate with any other Party.  Having accepted the responsibility, we should shoulder it.  Possibly, in the future, that may come about. Meantime, we have a situation in which we have two major political Parties, neither of which is able to get a clear majority on its own.  Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne, as well as the Labour Party, have to face that problem.  Both Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne as well as the Labour Party, have had the experience of being associated with inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I do not see as much wrong with it as Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne do.  If the Labour Party did not get all we required in the course of those three years, we did not expect to get it.  We knew we were making an experiment and would have to feel our way.  We were putting members of the Labour Party into ministerial office for the first time in this country and they had to learn their way about, both in regard to their responsibilities and their powers.  On the whole, they did not do too badly. There is one notable feature, that Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne have supported Fianna Fáil for two years, but no member of Fianna Fáil has resigned because Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne got too much of their own way.  A very leading member of Fine Gael resigned because he objected to what the Labour Party were getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party suffered under a disadvantage.  One of the big disadvantages in this country for any political Party, a disadvantage which Fianna Fáil very early recognised and remedied, is that in this country public opinion, as in other countries, is formed not merely by what goes on in this House or at political meetings but to a very great extent by the daily press, and Fianna Fáil have the advantage <Col N="366" /> of their own daily paper.  While Fine Gael has not got a Party organ, it has been consistently supported by the <i>Irish Independent</i> and up to recently by the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Now the <i>Irish Times</i> has swung over&mdash;a very peculiar phenomenon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if we do not get too close.  One of the most important factors in the political life of the country is the possession of a daily paper and from that point of view&mdash; all sensible men in the House and outside it recognise it&mdash;the Labour Party, in association with any other political Party, while that other Party has that big advantage, is going to carry on its work under tremendous difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the <i>Irish Press</i> is concerned, at the very commencement of the inter-Party Government, a campaign was started to try to bring pressure, as they thought, on the Labour Party and day after day the Party propaganda was churned out.  All of us to some extent, I suppose, are influenced by what we read in the papers and that campaign by Fianna Fáil&mdash; very wisely from their point of view because it was directed, I think, by the Tánaiste who is a very real politician&mdash; was concentrated on what they thought was the weak link in the chain of armour, the Labour Party.  They were fairly successful.  On the other hand, Fine Gael had papers sympathetic to them, and when anything was ever achieved in the inter-Party Government, these papers quite naturally gave a great deal of credit to Fine Gael.  I am not objecting in the slightest.  We went into it with our <Col N="367" /> eyes open and we knew what the risks were.  In the course of those three years, however, certain things were achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked us to-night what were the points which the Labour Party proposed to put forward as the basis of its associations with any other Party in Government.  He might not recall that the ten-point programme of the inter-Party Government had very close association with the Labour Party programme. In fact, it was almost completely taken out of the Labour Party election programme.  That was a fairly big achievement, that most of these points to some extent or other were carried.  I am not burking the question of the Social Welfare Act&mdash;granted that we did not get it through.  It would have been very nice, if we could have got it through, but like many other occasions, we created in this country an atmosphere which made that piece of legislation necessary not merely for the Labour Party but for other Parties.</P>
    <P>In 1947, there was some talk about social security and the Minister for Health had some kind of plan drawn up on a few pieces of paper, but there was not much beyond that.  By 1951, when Fianna Fáil went back into office, one of the main planks in their programme was that Social Security Act which went into law.  Again, there is no use trying to sidestep any awkward questions.  It is on the Statute Book and we are glad it is there.  We think it might have been better, in view of the fact that in 1947 the Minister proposed to give 24/- a week to an unemployed man and, in 1952, after Fianna Fáil had worked fairly strenuously to shove up prices, it was still 24/-.  However, it is there, with the additional benefits and the increase in social welfare payments.  But I wonder if the Social Welfare Act would be on the Statute Book to-day if, in 1948, the Labour Party had pursued the same course as they pursued in 1943 and had allowed Fianna Fáil to carry on as a single Party Government.  I do not know, but I have certain doubts about it, because, whatever else the inter-Party Government did or did not do, <Col N="368" /> it threw a very good scare into Fianna Fáil, a scare which was needed.  I think they need another one.</P>
    <P>Criticism is directed against the inter-Party Government and against any future inter-Party Government as being a collection of groups of divergent viewpoints, and the Taoiseach tells us that he would not propose to associate in a Government with any other Party because Fianna Fáil are a homogeneous Party but everybody knows that it is not homogeneous, that there are as many divergent opinions inside Fianna Fáil as there are in this House.  Does anybody for a moment suggest that, in so far as basic economic and social matters are concerned, the Tánaiste has the same outlook as the Minister for External Affairs or the Minister for Finance?  Does anybody suggest that a Deputy like Deputy McCann from the City of Dublin, with a long trade union background, has the same outlook as Deputy Corry?</P>
    <P>We know these differences are there, as they are in every Party.  The only difference is that Fianna Fáil have the advantage of having one of the leading personalities in Irish political life to lead them and lend the strength of his personality in holding the Party together.  I have great admiration, as I think all of us in the House have, for the Taoiseach.  Whatever he does or does not do from this on, he has his particular corner in Irish history and none of us can take it from him, but frankly, from the point of view of his own Party and the country, I think it would be better if he did not look for this vote of confidence, if he realised that in many ways he has got somewhat out of touch with conditions in the country.  You can strain the loyalty of a Party too much and put too much of a burden on it, and then you may break not only its spirit but the esteem in which it has been held by different sections of the people.  I have for a long time felt that the Taoiseach, because of his particular outlook on many economic and social problems, is out of touch not only with the needs of the moment in this country, but with many elements in his own Party.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting for those of us who are going to vote against this <Col N="369" /> motion that Deputy Cowan says we may be forced into an election.</P>
    <P>The trouble with Fianna Fáil is that the back benchers, even if they go into the Division Lobby and vote, will still not know whether or not they will have an election because one man, and one man only, will decide that.  Deputy Cowan says the Labour Party does not want a general election.  I think he said that because he thought we were worried about the results.  He switched over then to talk about unemployment. We are not worried about the results. The important thing is that we have a very serious situation so far as this country is concerned and those of us in the Labour Party&mdash;with all the hard things we have said about Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll&mdash;who have got a certain outlook more progressive, if you like, or to the left, than that of the two big Parties have a very important and particular duty to perform; that is, to see, as far as we can utilise whatever little political strength we have, that development is pushed in the proper direction.</P>
    <P>Now, on one occasion the Taoiseach paid tribute here to the Labour Party for their having brought Fine Gael, as he believed, on to a more progressive basis.  I suggest Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan have got the same responsibility to perform in regard to Fianna Fáil and they have got about 12 hours in which to make up their minds to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I do not expect there will be any change because it is not very easy when one has committed oneself to a particular line of political conduct to suddenly change overnight; and in the case of these Deputies not merely has there been a question of giving support in so far as the election of the Taoiseach was concerned but they seem now to have lost all sense of independence.  I do not know of any occasion, even on very trivial matters, on which they have voted against the Government.  Last week we were discussing the Health Bill and I thought Deputy Dr. Browne <Col N="370" /> should be somewhat concerned at the type of Health Bill that has now been produced as the result of his support of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I do not think it is the kind of Health Bill that either he or the Labour Party desire.  However, that is not the point at the moment, but in the course of the debate last week there a very minor amendment, which everybody knew the Government would win anyway if it came to a division, but in relation to which a very important principle was involved so far as Deputies like Labour Deputies and Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne were concerned; that was the issue as between the strict managerial system of local government and what many of us regard as a more democratic system. It came into debate in an involved manner in the course of the discussion on the amendment in question and it was quite clear what we were discussing. Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll spoke in favour of the amendment, spoke very effectively and appealingly to the Minister and asked him to accept it.  They knew what the principle involved was. We had a long discussion on the question of the rôle of the city and county manager and the rôle of his officials and the rôle of the elected democratic representatives and so on.  Yet, in the subsequent division even on that small item there was no show of independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not vote and everyone knew they were not going to vote and for that very reason Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll could have voted against the Government, knowing the Government would not be defeated.  In the course of his speech Deputy Dr. Browne covered a much wider field than Deputy Cowan and related his remarks not merely to the question of the effect of this particular motion but also to certain alternatives; he regarded his vote as being not merely a vote for <Col N="371" /> Fianna Fáil but possibly an amendment to some other form of government.  He went on to speak of what he called multi-Party government and he addressed certain questions to the Labour Party.  I do not think anybody has been under any misunderstanding in regard to the attitude of the Labour Party.  Neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil could misunderstand the attitude of that Party and I do not think there is any misunderstanding at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has its own special and independent and separate programme. It may be a good one or it may be a bad one but it happens to be our programme at the moment and we have publicly stated that we propose going into the next general election, as and when it may come, all depending on Deputies Browne and Cowan, on the basis of that programme.</P>

      <P>Let us hope the joke will not be on Deputy Cowan.  Even if the Government wins this division all of us are still in the position that we do not know whether or not there will be a general election within a matter of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the question that Deputy Dr. Browne posed.  It is an important question because it has an effect apparently on Deputy Dr. Browne, and possibly some influence on Deputy Cowan and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll. Deputy Dr. Browne asks what is the alternative?  He puts the question: Has the Labour Party yet drawn up its number of points, points <Col N="372" /> which it would regard as being essential and basic points in any agreement with another Party or in association with a Government?  He asked had they presented those points to Fine Gael and got Fine Gael's agreement? No, we have not.  We do not propose to do that.  We do not propose to go around hawking nine or ten points of a Labour Party programme to see who will say: &ldquo;Right, we will buy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is quite a straighforward one.  We have our programme.  On the basis of that programme we may get ten, 15 or 20 seats.  Whatever number we get will be the measure of support for that programme and if we find that in the Dáil after an election, should an election come, we are in a position to influence the character of the Government and that no Party is so fortunate as to be able to form a Government on its own, then the support given by the Labour Party on the basis of that Party's programme will be used to get as much of that programme implemented as we can.  That is a fair and open proposition.</P>
    <P>The points we propose to put forward are points out of the Labour Party programme upon which we will seek support in the general election, should a general election come.  It may be that we will not get agreement. It may be no one will accept any of the points we put forward.  Should that be the position we will have to be satisfied with it and remain a complete Opposition, unassociated with any Government. These points will be put forward publicly and they can be scrutinised, examined and studied not merely by Fine Gael but by any other Party. People can decide for themselves as to whether or not they are essential Labour Party points or just a collection of claptrap.  There is nothing secretive in that.  Everything will be open and above board.</P>
    <P>That is the position in which any small Party will find itself in this country until such time as that Party can convince the majority they should be given complete support.  The advantage is that over the years, either through the medium of utilising the support given by the Labour Party or through some other form, big changes <Col N="373" /> have taken place in this country.  We have now got many Acts on our Statute Book that would not be there to-day had there been no Labour Party.</P>
