    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that large numbers of boys and girls are continually leaving the Achill area, North Mayo, due to unemployment; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to remedy this state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that large numbers are obliged to emigrate from Ballycroy, North Mayo, due to the fact that no regular employment has been provided there; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to remedy this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the two districts to which he refers&mdash; which may be treated as one area for the purpose of his questions&mdash;are districts in which the economy of the population has, traditionally, over many decades been based to an appreciable extent on seasonal migration to employment elsewhere&mdash;mainly to agricultural employment in Scotland and England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy's questions are intended to suggest that there has, of late, been any deterioration in the economic condition of the area, the available information indicates that his questions have no foundation in fact. Inquiries which I have had made locally reveal that there is no evidence <Col N="2224" /> of any increase in migration from the area over any previous year, that the total number of persons registered at the local employment exchange at Achill at present is little higher than it was on the nearest corresponding date last year and that the number of men employed on the various State and local authority schemes in the area is now approximately 300 as compared with approximately 260 on the nearest corresponding date last year.  The latest available figures for the population of the area&mdash;those taken at the Census of 1951&mdash;show that, during the inter-censal period of five years from 1946 to 1951, the population of the area increased by 1.48 per cent., as compared with an increase of only 0.19 per cent. for the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, add that the development of the Ballycroy section of the scheme for the production of machine turf to supply the turf-burning electricity-generating station that will be erected at Bangor Erris will commence this summer and will provide employment for about 30 or 40 men in the Ballycroy district and that it is estimated that, when full production is reached in 1958, employment will be provided for an average of 180 men in the winter and an average of 270 in the summer.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, improvement grants out of the Road Fund for County Mayo as a whole for the financial year 1953-54 have been increased from £147,500 this year to £182,400 and, in addition, a sum of £50,000 has been allocated to the county out of voted moneys for the improvement of tourist roads in Gaeltacht and congested districts; there will, therefore, be available from these sources for County Mayo a sum of £84,900 more next year than there was available in the current financial year, and, while the location of the roadwork involved will be a matter for the county council, it is understood that a scheme costing from £6,500 to £7,000 is proposed for the improvement of a tourist road between Achill and Ballycroy and that another scheme costing approximately the same amount is proposed for the improvement of a tourist road between Mallaranny and Ballycroy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (i) the personnel and their emoluments <Col N="2226" /> of (a) An Bord Fáilte; (b) Fógra Fáilte; (ii) the expenditure and commitments to date of both bodies under the following heads (a) An Tóstal; (b) general; and (c) office premises, and (iii) whether there are premises held by these bodies in Cork City; and, if so, at what rent, and if the agreement is available for inspection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman of An Bord Fáilte is Mr. J.A. Nugent and the other members are Messrs. R. Beamish, A.P. McClafferty, S.J. Muldowney and J.P. O'Brien.  The remuneration of the chairman is at the rate of £500 a year and the remuneration of each of the other members is at the rate of £200 a year.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Fógra Fáilte is Mr. J.P. O'Brien and the other members are Messrs. R. Beamish, T. Condon, J.M. Glynn, A.P. McClafferty and F.A. Moran.  The remuneration of the chairman is at the rate of £1,000 a year and the remuneration of each of the other members is at the rate of £200 a year.</P>
      <P>As regards the expenditure and commitments for An Tóstal, 1953, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a question on this subject in Dáil Éireann on the 5th of last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general expenses of both boards, including expenditure on office accommodation, are met from moneys provided to them by way of Grants-in-Aid in accordance with the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  The expenditure of moneys issued by way of Grants-in-Aid is within the discretion of each of the boards.  The Act of 1952 requires that the accounts of both boards should be audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and that a copy of every annual balance sheet and income and expenditure account of each board, as passed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, together with his report thereon, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Having regard to these provisions I do not consider that An Bord Fáilte or Fógra Fáilte should be required to furnish specially the information which would be necessary to <Col N="2227" /> enable a reply to be given to the other parts of the question.</P>
    <P>An Bord Fáilte have no premises in Cork City.  Fógra Fáilte maintain a tourist information bureau in Cork City which is operated by the Irish Tourist Association as agents on their behalf. I understand from the board that the present premises are considered to be unsatisfactory and the bureau will be transferred in the near future to more suitable premises which Fógra Fáilte have leased for the purpose.  The operation of tourist bureaux is a matter within the discretion of Fógra Fáilte and I am not prepared to furnish information as to the rent, if any, payable for such premises or to suggest to Fógra Fáilte that any agreements that may be in existence should be made available for inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that sand is being imported for the manufacture of glass.  The possibility of using Muckish sand has been under examination for some time but no final conclusion has been reached.  The problem, I am informed, is mainly a technical one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that with the collapse of the U.S.A. market for prime carcase beef, several carcase meat plants in Ireland are in danger of collapse; and whether, in view of this, he will secure forthwith the release of cattle and sheep skins from control so as to ensure an economic return to the dead meat industry for these offals, instead of the present uneconomic price after £3 per hide levy has been imposed for the benefit of the leather, boot and shoe manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware there is no foundation for the statement in the first part of the question that several carcase meat plants in Ireland are in danger of collapse. Neither is there any justification for the statement that a levy of £3 per <Col N="2229" /> hide has been imposed for the benefit of the leather, boot and shoe manufacturers.</P>
      <P>So far as hides arising from current carcase beef exports are concerned the export of such hides is permitted and world prices are obtainable.</P>
      <P>Applications by carcase mutton exporters for permission to export sheep pelts are dealt with on their merits and in the light of the overall supply position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the market for prime carcase beef in the United States of America has collapsed and is no longer economic, and that the plants established now depend as to 95 per cent. on the market available on marketing the beef in Great Britain?  Is the Minister further aware that the price differential between carcase beef and beef on the hoof is founded on the assumption that the carcase meat men here can get the world price for hides, while, in fact, the carcase meat men here are getting about 1/- per lb., whereas the world price is 1/6 to 1/8 per lb. owing to the restriction on the type of person who is licensed to deal in hides?  Will the Minister say what reason he has for retaining control of the hide market, seeing that we have now a large surplus of hides over and above the total requirement of the tanning, boot and shoe industry?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The carcase meat exporters are allowed to export hides without restriction.  The levy imposed on the tanners is for the purpose of making payments to the carcase meat exporters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you instituted the arrangement and left me with a debt of £500,000 due to the carcase meat exporters.  That £500,000 has to be paid, and there is no other means of paying that debt except by a levy on the hides used by Irish tanners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned on this Estimate last night, I was pointing out to the Minister that a serious misjudgment in policy has taken place, in my opinion, particularly in relation to the reduction in the quantity of seed sown in the nurseries last year and the quantity proposed to be sown this year. During the spring of 1949, 1950 and 1951 approximately 14,000 lb. of seed were sown in the nurseries with a view to producing between 45,000,000 and 50,000,000 healthy transplants for the purpose of planting a fairly sizable forestry programme.  According to the information given at Question Time yesterday, that has been cut down to less than one-fourth.  I think that is a grave mistake, particularly when we know that land acquisition, and that was the really big trouble in afforestation up to this, is easing up somewhat and the figures for land acquisition are a little bit more hopeful than they were three, four, five or six years ago.  If the present policy continues, the <Col N="2249" /> Department will find itself in three or four years' time with sufficient plantable land to carry out the programme laid down by the inter-Party Government but with insufficient transplants to fill the programme.</P>
      <P>There may be some argument against planting 12,000 lb., or 13,000 lb., or 14,000 lb. of seed.  If the seed is planted and it is subsequently found that there is a shortage of land, labour or anything else and the transplants cannot be utilised by the Forestry Department, they will not go to loss.  Room will be found for them somewhere in the country, and good use can be made of them.  There was a reduction last year. I appeal to the Minister this year to reconsider the matter before the seeds are sown and put down a larger quantity of seed.</P>
      <P>There has been a very noticeable cutting down on the programme handed over to the Minister by the previous Government.  That is a mistake.  Last year we paid over £8,250,000 for foreign timber of all kinds.  I think I am right in saying that the country from which we imported the largest quantity of timber does not buy in return as much as £100 worth of produce.  Cutting down the programme now will put off the day still further that this country will be self-sufficient in its timber requirements.  We cannot say that we have not plenty of unemployed at the moment and, therefore plenty of labour available for turning over to this very useful development work.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to have cast a very jaundiced eye on the forestry programme merely because the Minister's predecessor was keen on expanding that programme.  In the light of the Cameron Report, and the advice tendered there, the Minister should review Government policy now in relation to forestry.  He should certainly not cut down on it.  He took over a Forestry Division in full working order. The staff had been considerably augmented.  In reality, of course, forestry should be a separate State Department and not a mere section of another Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cutting down on the programme for the sake of the few pounds that will <Col N="2250" /> be saved is one of the worst steps the Government can take.  I do not say that for the sake of scoring political points.  This is a section of our national activity that I would like to keep completely free from politics. Every year we hear protestations from everybody in relation to forestry.  It is not much good calling for afforestation if the Minister allows himself to be overruled by the Minister for Finance by cutting down this useful branch of public activity.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have the figures the Minister gave us yesterday in relation to the acquisition of land.  That was the big problem where forestry is concerned. If the land does not come in in a steady stream each year the Forestry Division cannot plant.  While I did expect a better return I was pleased with the figures the Minister gave particularly in regard to the acreage for which offers have been made.  I did not ask him for the figures for which offers had been accepted but I presume the story there would be equally encouraging.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to expedite the work of the Forestry Division to the utmost because it is there that the foundation of the scheme lies.  Once again, I appeal to him to consider planting more seeds in the nurseries this year so that he, or his successor, will not find himself in the unhappy position, two, three or four years hence with plenty of land, labour and fencing material but not enough transplants to carry out a programme.  Transplants are not available from outside sources.  Apart from that, I doubt if transplants from foreign sources would be a success.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us, when he is replying, has Shelton Abbey been given over as a training school and has the change-over from Avondale to Shelton Abbey that was envisaged prior to the taking over of that estate taken place?  If it has not, what is the cause of the delay?  One of the things that was particularly annoying to me during my term of office as Minister for Lands was the overcrowding which has grown up in Avondale due to the large numbers engaged in <Col N="2251" /> forestry training there and whatever necessary staffs were there.  I took a keen interest, for that reason, in the purchase of that estate which obviated the necessity of the Minister for Finance providing money to build a suitably sized college in Avondale or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that, apart altogether from the valuable crop of standing timber which was on the Shelton Abbey lands, the house or castle itself, whatever you like to call it, was a very valuable acquisition from the point of view of saving the State the necessity for building a new training college to replace Avondale.</P>
    <P>Avondale has filled a very useful place in the history of forestry in this country.  Apart from the fact that it has such an historical association with Parnell, it has performed a very useful function.  I am glad to say that forestry there has grown out of its clothes and great progress has been made.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us, if he has the information, what number of trainees are under the Department at the present time and what number it is hoped to take in the coming year?</P>
    <P>If my memory is correct, there were between 600 and 700 acres of mature standing timber of first-class commercial quality on the Shelton Abbey lands at the time of taking over.  I do not know what has taken place there since but in view of the success from the financial point of view of the saw mill in Dundrum, with its drying kilns and very modern equipment, might I impress on the Minister the great necessity of establishing a saw mill there to make use of the growing timber which in a few years' time&mdash;and a few years will not be long elapsing&mdash;will be passing maturity and will perhaps go into the firewood stage?  One of the greatest handicaps forestry has suffered from is that home-grown timber has never been marketed or presented to the purchaser in the same condition as foreign timber of inferior quality has been presented to the purchaser. I said this before as Minister for Lands and I repeat it now that Irish home-grown timber is second to none in the <Col N="2252" /> world provided we grow it, dry it, saw it and market it with the same care and the same attention as that which is sold to us from British Columbia, Finland, Sweden and the other sources from which foreign timber comes.  Our timber is equal to the best and there is only one way to make progress and the Minister for Lands should take the lead in that regard.</P>
    <P>A start has been made in Dundrum and it has been extended in Cong. Further progress could be made in Portumna, Shelton Abbey and other places where there are considerable quantities of mature timber.  The Minister should take the bit in his teeth, disregard the counsel of the Minister for Finance in this connection and establish a sawmill with the most modern equipment he can get&mdash;drying kilns, and so on.  The Minister will agree with me that they are not costly. They will not scare any Minister for Finance, no matter how slowly revenue is coming in.  The Minister should give a lead in this regard and endeavour to put Irish home-grown timber on the market in as good a condition as foreign timber is marketed to show and convince the pessimists in this country that forestry can be a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to a feature of the Minister's opening speech last night. He paid great attention to the way the Department was using up a lot of its energy in attending to thinnings, care of plantations, and so on.  I will not be led off the path by that.  However, I want to say that I wish the Minister the best of luck in connection with thinning operations and in keeping the existing plantations in first-class order. Let me congratulate him on putting down his foot firmly and insisting that that work be done.  As I said last night, it is only waste of the taxpayers' money if we sow a crop of timber and let it grow into a lot of spikes for want of the necessary care. Timber is a crop and it requires periodic attention just the same as any other crop on the land.  It must be looked after right up to the time it is fit for felling.  I am proud to hear that the Minister has taken such a firm stand in relation to existing plantations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2253" /> Let me say this also, that the sale of thinnings, if it is carried out on a big scale, will be a very valuable source of profit, and that he may convince some of the diehards in the Department of Finance that forestry is not all spending and nothing coming in.  The sale of thinnings was, and is at the present time, a very valuable source of profit. It must be remembered that if there was never sale for thinnings&mdash;even if we are forced to let them rot in the ground&mdash;there is a basic necessity for the operation if we are going to produce proper timber.</P>
    <P>However, I do not agree with the Minister when he tries to put across the floor of the House that the care of the existing plantations is a good, sound and sufficient argument for dropping down the programme.  I am not at all convinced that the Minister was wise in dropping off on the programme I laid down.  Preparations were made for the planting of 19,500 acres, and he comes and tells us there is no use in using up all the plantable area in one year or two.  I quite agree; but does the Minister deny that the supply of plantable land is going to be increased?  What was the cause for increasing the staff to the extent of 15 officials, if we include the three Land Commission men seconded? Land will be coming in.  All the figures he has given us have given the lie to that suggestion that land will not be available in increasing acreages.  With sufficient acquisition staff, the land will come in, and I think the Minister has made a ghastly mistake that will only begin to pinch hard in three or four years' time, by cutting down the weight of the seeds planted last year.  However, the seeds are not sown this year and will not be for the next couple of weeks, and I think it is not too late yet to repair the damage.  Unless he takes action now we will find ourselves in a position in three or four years' time that we will have ample equipment and ample young men to work, but we will not have the transplants to plant out.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish the Minister every success and good luck in this particular branch of his Department. It is one in which I took a very keen interest and will continue to take a <Col N="2254" /> very keen interest.  Apart from the fact that we should have our own supplies of timber we should at least lay the foundation now for earning that £8,000,000 which we are paying out at the present time so that, by the time the timber reaches maturity, it will be worth between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000.</P>
    <P>Now that it is readily acknowledged by all that the Undeveloped Areas Bill is more or less a flop, let me point out once again to the Minister that the onus of providing employment in the undeveloped areas rests largely on the Forestry Department.  Nobody can dare raise objection to the Minister for Lands creating plantations in what have come to be known as the undeveloped areas and giving employment to our young men to encourage them to stay at home.  It is a very healthy kind of employment and enables us to develop our own country. It is not like making a road, making a drain or a fence in which there is little or no source of profit.  From the day trees are put down nature is doubling and trebling the value of that plantation year by year until it comes to final maturity.</P>
    <P>I say that in the hands of the Minister for Lands lies the solution for saving what is left of the Irish-speaking population of the Gaeltacht.  Secondly, in his hands lies the opportunity to develop our undeveloped areas.  The factories, if any, that will be established under the Undeveloped Areas Act will be confined to the towns.  In the hands of the Forestry Department therefore lies the solution for maintaining employment in the rural areas and at the same time of assuring this country of decent supplies of native timber.  I urge on the Minister the necessity of going about the country and taking even a greater interest than he has been taking in forestry.  That is not accusing him of lagging on the job up to the present but I want him to take even a greater interest in this work.  I was very proud to hear him say last night that he has visited plantations which are far removed from the capital and I urge on him to do more of that kind of work.  The staff of the Forestry Department has not, <Col N="2255" /> I am sure, changed since my time and he will find them willing and ready to co-operate with him in every way.  He will find that they are as competent at their job as any staff in the Civil Service and that is saying a good deal. I am sure the enthusiasm that I observed when I was in the Department has not waned since.  The Minister has it in his power to save what is left of the Irish speaking population. Apart from that, if he carries out this programme energetically he will leave behind him a crop of growing timber that will be of considerable value to coming generations who in their turn will thank him for what he has done for them in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reserve my remarks on the Forestry Vote for the general Estimate which will come before the House in the near future. Arising out of the Supplementary Estimate, however, I should like to emphasise the importance of one or two points made by Deputy Blowick, especially in connection with the Gaeltacht areas and congested areas generally in the West.  I have got figures in the course of the last few months from the Minister in regard to the plantations in each of the counties that are known as congested counties and I am afraid, although a great deal of lip service is now being paid by both sides of the House to the necessity for afforestation in western areas, that very little practical work is being done.  In the year 1950-51, of the total afforestation programme in the <Col N="2256" /> country only 2,319 acres were planted in the eight counties of Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.  If anybody suggests to me that that is a worthwhile contribution towards the solution of the problem of afforestation in the West, my answer would be that it is completely insufficient.  Apart altogether from the small amount of plantation work that has taken place, let us have a look at the figures with regard to the amount of land acquired for afforestation in the period 1950-51. In that year 3,800 acres were acquired for afforestation purposes.  To my mind that is only nibbling at the problem in the West of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Blowick that the Undeveloped Areas Act has been a failure.  It is too soon yet to know whether real benefit will accrue to the West of Ireland from that Act and I think we should give it a little more time but nobody can hope that the Undeveloped Areas Act by itself will provide the solution for the problems that face the West of Ireland. Undoubtedly if afforestation is carried out on a major scale, it should be possible to relieve a great deal of the unemployment in the West and to stem emigration.  The extraordinary position in which we find ourselves in this House, however, is that while little afforestation work is being done in western areas&mdash;the figures given by the Minister prove that&mdash;when we come to examine the valuation of holdings in Ireland, we find that in those congested counties in Connaught there are 55,000 holdings with valuations under £4 and we have 51,000 holdings with valuations over £4 but under £10.  There is no hope that these people will become owners of economic holdings in the near future.  The Land Commission has said time and again that there is not sufficient land in the country to give economic holdings to those who are living in the congested districts.  Consequently alternative steps have to be taken to provide employment and what more useful employment could be provided on those holdings than that derived from afforestation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question <Col N="2257" /> yesterday about the possibility of embarking on an afforestation programme in one area in my own constituency, and he told me that they had no office in that locality.  I believe that if the officials of the Forestry Department are serious about their job, it is their duty to go down to these areas and inquire from the people whether they are willing to give up land, at the same time pointing out to them the benefits that will accrue if an afforestation programme is embarked upon in these areas.  We have the extraordinary suggestion from both sides of the House that if we do not get land for afforestation then we cannot carry out afforestation.  That is the sum total of the remarks of the Minister and of the ex-Minister.  I wonder are we serious about this matter?  I make no bones at all about it; I am expressing not alone my own view but likewise that of a very considerable volume of opinion outside this House in regard to afforestation.  If it is found impossible to get land for afforestation under the present system, then power must be given to the Department of Forestry to acquire that land if necessary by compulsion.</P>

      <P>I want to find out from Deputy Blowick and Deputy Derrig, the Minister for Lands, whether they are satisfied to make afforestation the plaything of politics as it has been for the last four or five years.  Deputy <Col N="2258" /> Blowick comes into this House and attacks the Minister for not embarking on an increased programme of afforestation for the West but the figures during his own régime proved he had little or no interest in afforestation except, perhaps, in regard to his own constituency.  Deputy Blowick should keep quiet on the question of what he did for the West.  I suggest to the Minister that the people need education on this question of afforestation.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident that in rural areas many people do not realise the immense benefit that would be conferred not only on the country but on themselves in the various areas if afforestation programmes were carried out in the congested areas in the West.  I think the Minister should send his inspectors to local halls, get the co-operation of the local clergymen and give lectures in these halls on the advantages of afforestation.  If you get the local spirit of the people behind you they will pour in offers of land to the Department of Forestry at a reasonable price once they realise the benefits that will accrue if afforestation is carried out.  It is very foolish to expect the first step to be taken by the local people when they have little knowledge about the method of going about it.  I have no doubt that the amount of land that could be made available for afforestation in the West could be trebled at least if the steps I suggest were taken by the Minister.</P>
      <P>If it was decided, through the co-operation of the local people, to embark upon an afforestation programme in a certain congested area it would follow that there would be employment for at least six months of the year in that locality.  Up to the present the only employment available to these men is that which is provided by the Special Employment Schemes Office which generally amounts to the repair of a road and the cleaning of a drain.  The total sum involved might be in the region of £200 to £300.  That work might last for three weeks or five weeks at the most, but for the rest of the time the men in that locality either twiddle their tumbs or go across to England to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> Now and again the county councils might have a roads improvement scheme in the locality.  That is also helpful in a congested area but in that connection there is no such thing as security.  In those areas a man could not say this year: &ldquo;I will have work next year, the year after and the year after that again on afforestation in my locality.&rdquo; If the matter is put to him in that light, I am certain that he will be willing to give up out of his small valuation a portion of his land to the Forestry Department so that this afforestation programme could be gone ahead with.  If you got in any of these areas 300 to 400 people willing to give portion of their land&mdash;all these holdings adjoin each other&mdash;look at the employment that could be given.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should pick a pilot area in the West of Ireland.  There is one place at the moment crying out for that type of experiment.  It is the Kiltullagh area which I mentioned recently.  In a half parish alone you have 428 holdings, 348 of which are under £5 valuation.  In that area alone, there is land ideal for afforestation.  Surrounding that congested area there are thousands of acres of bog and mountainy land.  If my suggestion were adopted, Land Commission problems in that area would be solved for all time.  It would solve the problem of the labour exchanges in that area as a whole because employment would be given and the returns would be there in the form of fine, standing timber, 20 or 30 years hence.</P>
    <P>In addition, in that area&mdash;I am only mentioning this area but the same could be done in many other areas if the Minister so desires&mdash;it would mean that many of the houses in which the people live at present could be demolished and a village or small town could be erected by degrees in the heart of that forestry area.  The fuel and power to supply and keep that community going could be provided by the afforestation itself.  It would be a self-contained unit where there would be good employment, good housing conditions and all the necessary services for the people of that locality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2260" /> If the Minister wants information on how these things are done he need only look at some of the films which show the degree of development work of that nature which is carried out in Canada.  If they can do that in Canada I cannot see why we should not be able to follow that example in Ireland.  For the past 30 years we have too much dead wood at the head of the Department of Forestry.  There is plenty of timber and we have got quite a considerable amount in the Forestry Department.  I do not want to be taken as criticising individual civil servants but I am afraid that the proper Government directive has not been given to the Department.  To my mind if any Government Department is given a line of policy and the money then it will carry out whatever directive is given it.  I do not want to be taken as blaming members of the forestry section.  I prefer to cast the blame for the neglect that has taken place on the Governments that have been in power and in particular on the Ministers who have had control of the Forestry Department in the years past.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that, even on a debate on forestry, Deputy McQuillan can always hold himself forth consistently as the only Simon Pure in this House, the only man in this House who is not a politician and who is not in politics.  On every subject that is debated in the House Deputy McQuillan impartially belabours a particular Minister and a particular Deputy and in case anybody might question his independence he seeks immediately to transfer his criticism to the other side of the House and he belabours the other side of the House with equal vehemence.

      <P>The Deputy is spread between the two.  He has a leg on each of them.  Might I suggest to the Deputy that there are people on all sides of this House who have just as much interest in forestry as the Deputy has?  There are people in this House whose approach to the solution of various problems, including forestry. is made with as much sincerity and honesty as his is.  The Deputy has no right&mdash;and certainly he has no right to be allowed to get away with it&mdash;to suggest that everyone here but himself is a dishonest politician or an inefficient one.</P>
      <P>I find myself on this Estimate to a very large extent in agreement with the criticisms of the progress that have been made, but unfortunately I have been criticising this Department for about 30 years without a break.  The Department had a view for years&mdash;I did not agree with it and I hope it has changed&mdash;that you could not grow timber on the western seaboard, notwithstanding the evidence there to show that where the money and the labour were available timber could be grown successfully.  That evidence exists in Connemara and along the western seaboard and there is in Connemara to-day&mdash;though, unfortunately, very little of it, apart from what has been cut down&mdash;very valuable mature timber, commercial timber.  It can be grown there if the right methods, the right varieties and the right approach are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is no use in Deputy McQuillan trying to make out that it is easy to do it.  He said he was not going to accept from the present Minister or his predecessor the plea that it was difficult to get land. According to him there is no trouble in getting land&mdash;even where it is more scarce than in any other part of the country.  He told us there are tens of thousands of uneconomic holdings in the congested areas where the valuation <Col N="2262" /> was less than £4.  Does not that in itself answer his sweeping assertion that it is easy to get land?  Where can we get it?</P>

We know that these people hang on to their little homes and holdings as tenaciously as any man in County Meath, County Tipperary or County Limerick.</P>

      <P>Fight it out between yourselves.  If the Deputy would only listen to me he would find I am going further along the road with his line of thought than probably the Minister or the ex-Minister would go.  In the West and North-West, even in Donegal, more has been done in forestry in the last five or six years than was done in the previous 15.  That is not admitting for a moment that it is anything like what should be done, but at least it was a start.</P>
      <P>I would like to see more money made available and a fresh effort to get more land and suitable land.  This year, we are making directly available for tourism in the neighbourhood of £500,000&mdash;£250,000 to the Tourist Board and £250,000 to the other board we set up.  Ireland is talked about as being a beautiful country.  It is, in spots.  The beauty spots are fewer to-day than 50 years ago, as a lot of the spots made beautiful by rich mature timber have been despoiled by the timber being cut down and no replanting.  I venture to say that notwithstanding 30 years of State work there are fewer trees in this country to-day than there were 30 years ago.  I think there is very little doubt about that.</P>
      <P>I know there will have to be a very definite tightening up on the felling of timber, even in the immediate vicinity of the towns and cities.  People acquire land for development purposes and they are allowed, apparently without question, to fell trees, some of them really beautiful trees that add considerably to the amenities of the district and to the approaches to our various towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are so fond of attacking the particular Minister who happens to be in office at the moment, and so fond of attacking the Department, that I think we ought to face the fact that those of our people who have land and who live in the rural areas are not themselves doing their part.  I suggest that, without any great cost to the State and at very little cost to the individual farmer, <Col N="2264" /> this country could be made infinitely more beautiful than it is to-day and we could add enormously to the number of trees in the country while, incidentally, we could take that cheerless appearance off the majority of houses in rural Ireland to-day.  I can see no reason whatever why, when the plants are made available free of charge&mdash;and if they are not I believe they should be &mdash;any man who has a holding could not plant from 25 to 500 trees around his own home without seriously affecting his farm, but, indeed, adding considerably to its value.  If we had trees planted around houses in rural Ireland &mdash;and particularly some evergreens&mdash; the whole of the country would look better and so would the houses themselves. They would certainly not look as cheerless as many of them do now on a winter's day.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Deputies who are members of local committees could themselves do a considerable amount, and I would be prepared to advocate that, if it is necessary&mdash;although it should not be necessary&mdash;not merely should the plants be made available free of charge but even a small subsidy should be given, provided the farmers would undertake to see that those trees were properly planted and properly protected and that the maintenance would be the responsibility of the farmer and his family.  It seems to me to be an easy way, a simple way, and it is, in my opinion, for what it is worth, the least costly way of getting results and getting them fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that if there is one matter more than another which should not be made the plaything of Party politics it is forestry.  I have belaboured, not both sides of the House at the same time, but whatever side happened to be in power at the time and have told them quite plainly and bluntly that they were not making the efforts they should make and, as I thought, could make.  We talk a good deal about attracting tourists.  I think we are forgetting the essentials and forestry is one of them.  Anybody who has ever been, even for a very short time, in Switzerland or in parts of France will appreciate that the <Col N="2265" /> beauty of these countries or parts of these countries is almost entirely due to the fact that they are planted, and I have seen trees growing in places the climatic conditions of which differ very little from our climatic conditions here.  I can see no reason why they could not be grown here.</P>
    <P>I know that it is said that along the western counties, owing to the prevailing winds, you cannot get timber to grow, that it is stunted and warped and blown to one side by the prevailing strong west winds.  The winds blow in countries other than this country and in some they blow much more strongly than they do here, and still with very little, if any, difference in climatic conditions as compared with this country they are able to grow timber successfully.  I know there was a theory&mdash;I hope I am correct in using the past tense&mdash;in the Department that you had to have the minimum of 200 acres to make it economic to plant timber.</P>

      <P>It is worse they are getting, instead of better.  I do not accept that argument for one moment, unless you are going to take it purely on an £s. d. basis and there are returns to this State other than purely £s.d. returns.  I am not admitting that, even on an £s.d. basis, it would not pay.  We are paying through the nose for timber year after year&mdash; importing it from the ends of the earth. There are many subsidiary industries which could be working effectively, usefully and profitably here, if we had our own native timber.  In Switzerland, every three miles of road at least that one that travels one sees a sawmill working on their own native timber, but there is more than that, because, in practically every house in rural Switzerland, wood carving is carried on and they are producing souvenirs for the tourists attracted by the beauty of the country, a beauty which is largely made up of green trees, and selling these souvenirs in the best market in the world and at the highest prices at home to tourists.  Their own homes are largely built of timber and <Col N="2266" /> there is much more timber used in the building of their homes than is used in the building of our homes.  It is to an extent used as a substitute for other building materials which, if they had not their own native timber, they would have to import.</P>
      <P>While I am not at all satisfied that we are progressing as rapidly as one would like, it is only fair to say that there has been an improvement and I am quite satisfied that the present Minister is keen, like his predecessor, on progressing as rapidly as he possibly can; but Deputies ought to remember also that the Minister can spend only the amount of money that is made available to him, and that depends very largely on the Minister for Finance.  That ought to be kept in mind.  When Deputies talk about the importance of forestry or re-afforestation&mdash;and it cannot be over-emphasised&mdash;they ought to think of that when we make available and spend money on matters which are of very little importance and which will not give us anything like the same return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House, as well as to the Minister, that we might see if effect could not be given to the suggestion I make with regard to inducing people living in rural Ireland to do their part in the immediate vicinity of their homes by carrying out planting, even if it were 25, 200, 300 or 500 trees.  When you have regard to the number of holdings in the country, that in itself would be a very big contribution to the problem.  I sincerely hope the Minister will continue his efforts and will try to get more and more land.  I know that it is not easy to get it, and I know that there is a local outcry if you take land upon which even a sheep can nibble an existence, for forestry.  The unfortunate part of it is that, down in the West of Ireland, you can see mountainsides where there is nothing but bare rock, because whatever soil was there has been washed and blown away, due to the fact that there is nothing there to hold it.  Unless there is some planting done even in the foothills, so to speak, still more rock will be exposed and more soil washed away.  I know one or two areas where a very genuine <Col N="2267" /> attempt was made by the Forestry Department to acquire land on the sides of hills&mdash;land which was commonage or held in common as sheep runs. They met with as ferocious an opposition as they would meet with in the heart of County Meath if they went in there to acquire land for the purpose of planting.  While one must express the view that we are not entirely satisfied with the progress made, at the same time, we ought to give some recognition to the difficulties the Department has to meet and try to overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey might be pleased to know that it is not my intention to attack either the Minister or his predecessor.  I am satisfied that both have been making some attempt to deal with this problem, but I think that both the present Minister and his predecessor will admit that the progress has been very slow.  Living as I do in a county which is extensively under afforestation, I know some of the difficulties that have to be encountered. You may think that a hillside or mountain is freely available for afforestation, but, when you come to acquire it, you may find that it is owned jointly by a number of comparatively small holders who depend to a great extent for their economic existence upon the grazing rights they enjoy there.  While one or two might be willing and even very anxious to sell to the Forestry Department, others might not.  They might, perhaps justifiably, be anxious to hold on to the grazing rights which they have held over a number of years. These are not large landowners and not people of the landlord class.  They are ordinary working farmers and when you come up against that problem, you realise that you have to step carefully. You cannot trample under foot the rights of owners of hill land or bog land.  If you do, you will create dangers and difficulties which will impede rather than speed up afforestation. Nevertheless, it is essential that the work be advanced.  It is gratifying to note in this Supplementary Estimate that over the past year there has been a considerable expansion in the work of afforestation.  It is gratifying to see the Forestry Department <Col N="2268" /> come to this House before the end of the year to seek £70,000 more than they estimated at the beginning of the year for their requirements I think it is much better for a Minister to do that than to estimate for a large sum and to fail to expend it in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have acquired more land in the past year for afforestation, that we have planted more land during the past year than in the previous year, that we have employed more workers during the past year than in the previous year and that we have paid them higher wages in the past year than in the previous year, is a matter for satisfaction.</P>
      <P>All we can do in connection with this Supplementary Estimate is to encourage the Minister to go forward as rapidly as possible with the work of acquiring and planting land and to seek ways and means of overcoming the fundamental difficulties that beset his path.  It is very easy to say to the Minister to go out and acquire holdings upon which there is a considerable amount of hill land suitable for planting.  On every holding that you acquire there will be a certain amount of land which may possibly be suitable for planting but which is even more suitable for agricultural purposes.  In our anxiety to press forward the work of afforestation we must not allow ourselves to fall into the error of planting with timber arable land which can be and which has been cultivated.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever but that when the Forestry Department acquire a substantial holding of land after considerable difficulty and expense there is a great temptation to put that entire holding under timber.  I think that that is something which ought not to be done.  If one or two fields upon a holding which has been acquired for afforestation can be used for agricultural purposes I say that those fields should be separated from the rest and utilised for agricultural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not allow ourselves to be blinded by our enthusiasm for increased plantation to the essential needs of the community in the matter of the production of food.  The conflict between <Col N="2269" /> the production of food and the production of timber will always exist.  Only those who live in a county where there is considerable afforestation can realise this very fully.  I know the difficulty in regard to this matter.  If you want to separate the agricultural portions of land that adjoin or perhaps become surrounded by a timber plantation you must incur expenditure in the matter of fencing.  That is the difficulty that the Forestry Department are always up against but it is a difficulty which they must face.  You cannot put considerable areas of good agricultural land under timber merely in order to save a certain amount of expenditure on fencing.  I think the Minister should stress that to his Department.  Every Deputy who knows anything about this problem knows that there are considerable areas of good agricultural land which, until recently, yielded excellent crops of potatoes, oats and other agricultural produce and which are now under timber.  I do not think that even those who are most enthusiastic about the planting of waste land would advocate such a step but it is one of the difficulties that must be faced and overcome.</P>
    <P>If we are to extend the area under afforestation, we must be prepared to deal with smaller areas than we have dealt with heretofore.  We must be prepared to put areas much smaller than 300 or 200 acres under plantation. That creates administrative and fencing difficulties but we have got to face the situation as it exists in this State. There are not so many very large areas in the country that can be acquired and planted.  You must deal with smaller parcels of land suitable for the growing of timber.  In that way you can add very much to the area under plantation.</P>
    <P>I have been informed of a grievance of men in my constituency who are employed by the Forestry Department and that is that in adjoining areas different wage rates prevail.  I suggest that, wherever that occurs, the higher rate should be paid.  Where you have a number of men employed together as in North Wicklow and on the borders of County Dublin, I think it is essential for contentment and satisfaction <Col N="2270" /> among the men that the higher rate of wages should be paid to all the men employed together.</P>
    <P>This is a very comprehensive Supplementary Estimate covering most of the activities of the Minister's Department. As it has been mentioned already, I should like to ask what progress has been made with the development of Shelton Abbey as a forestry school.  I should also like to know what it is intended to do with the Avondale afforestation school.  Is it to be continued or, if not, for what purpose will it be used?</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the considerable expansion that has occurred in his Department during the past year.  If that expansion is to continue, it is most essential that the utmost use be made of all timber that comes to maturity, in the first place, and of all thinnings which are being eliminated in the course of the maintenance of plantations.</P>
    <P>I think that nothing would be more conducive to an expansion of our forestry operations than the fact that there was an income to the State from the sale of the products of the areas we had under plantations.  I think that the development of an industry for the manufacture of wallboard and other products of that kind, which are produced from timber pulp, should open up a very substantial market for the thinnings of our plantations and so ensure a certain income to meet the expenditure which the Department incurs.</P>
    <P>I think that the whole question should be examined with a view to seeing what other industries, based on timber, can be established.  I think it is essential, wherever you have substantial areas of land under State forests and where timber is coming to maturity, that industries should be established for its utilisation to the best possible advantage.  I suggest that not only do you require sawmills but you require the necessary plant for the drying of the timber so as to make it available in the best possible condition. You require, in addition, such industries as will convert that timber into finished products, whether they be <Col N="2271" /> furniture or woodwork for building and other operations.</P>
    <P>I think it is by showing the community at large that there is a potential and growing income to be derived from our State forests that we can get its goodwill for the increased expenditure that may be required to expand the area under those forests.  I think, further, that the whole question of giving an incentive to farmers to put a certain area of their land under timber should be examined.  The existing incentive is not, I think, sufficient.  It is true that there is a plantation grant which probably covers the cost of the plants, but the greater expenditure in regard to small-scale planting of timber is in the matter of drainage and fencing. I think it is in that respect that something further should be done to ensure that on every agricultural holding a certain area is put under timber. I know there is a great deal of good work being done by the local committees of agriculture in the production of shelter belts in Wicklow particularly and, I think, in Carlow.  I think that scheme has been very widely availed of and that it could be extended.  Anyone travelling through County Wicklow will notice how many shelter belts are to be seen on farmers' holdings.</P>
    <P>I still think that there is a great deal to be done in the production of timber. On a great many farms there is a patch of one acre, or even less, of waste land that could be planted if some additional help were given to cover the cost of its fencing.  It must be remembered, of course, that every farmer who puts an acre or two of land under timber is depriving himself of the chance of deriving any income from that piece of land for a considerable number of years.  That fact has to be understood. For the community at large, as well as for farmers themselves as a body who, of course, have to look forward and consider the interests of their successors, there is a great advantage to be derived from the planting of small patches of waste land on every farm where such waste land is available.  For that reason, I think the whole community&mdash;the State in the first place, the <Col N="2272" /> county councils, the local committees of agriculture, and the local parish committees&mdash;should pull together to ensure that this work is undertaken: to see that every available inch of waste land which cannot be used for agricultural purposes is put under timber and which will produce not an immediate income but an income which will become available in the course of a period of years to the farmer himself in the first place, and to the whole nation.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but I want to say this that while I am a member of this House I will not stand for that class of thing.  After all, the farmers in the West of Ireland are the people who were driven into the poorer lands in the years gone by, and if Deputy McQuillan or anybody else is descended from a class that believes in that class of thing, I want to assure him that I do not believe in that class of thing, and that I am not descended from such a class.  I agree thoroughly with the different points that were made in their speeches by Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Blowick.  They have spoken at considerable length and have mentioned many of the matters that I had intended to refer to.</P>
      <P>The main suggestion that I would make to the Minister is that he should encourage small farmers, landowners and others, to make use of the grants available under the afforestation scheme for the planting of trees on their own lands.  I believe that the amount of the grant payable to a farmer for planting his own land is entirely inadequate.  Ten pounds per acre is not sufficient.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the advisability of doubling the amount of the grant.  My information is that the sum voted annually by the House for that particular section of the forestry branch is not availed of to the extent that we would like, the reason being that the farmers consider the grant inadequate.</P>
      <P>In recent times in this House there was an announcement made by the Minister for Agriculture that he would increase the amount of grant payable for projects under Section A of the land reclamation scheme.  If the Minister for Agriculture can persuade the Minister for Finance to give substantial increases to farmers for land reclamation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I consider that the previous Minister and the present Minister did their best in furthering this particular branch of the Department of Lands.  In my view the task of a Minister for Lands is an onerous one.  He must accept a lot of responsibility. He must deal with Land Commission work, and many other things, apart from this particular matter of forestry.  I submit that it would be advisable to have a separate Department <Col N="2275" /> of Forestry or, alternatively, that the Minister should have a Parliamentary Secretary.  Other Ministers have Parliamentary Secretaries.  Having regard to the volume of work undertaken over a number of years by the Land Commission, difficult work that occupies a great deal of the time of the Minister for Lands, the Minister could not devote the time to this particular aspect of his Department that I would like to see him devoting to it.</P>

      <P>Tourism has been referred to by Deputy Morrissey.  At the present time colossal sums of public moneys are being devoted to schemes, perhaps some of them good schemes, to encourage tourists to come to this country.  If we want to encourage tourists, one of the first things we should set about doing is to build up forestry blocs, particularly in the West of Ireland.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in many parts of Mayo, particularly North Mayo, there are tracts of land that could be acquired, not by compulsion but by agreement, at full market value.  Quite a reasonable approach can be adopted.  There is no need to resort to black-and-tan methods in a matter of this kind.  If the Minister sets about this task of acquiring large tracts of land in North Mayo by agreement, paying full market value, that in itself will tend to attract tourists into areas where the ordinary people find it very hard to attract them.  The tendency is for tourists to go to the larger cities, to built-up areas.  By speeding up acquisition of land and the planting of what is at present waste land in the West of Ireland the Minister would be doing a very good day's work which would be in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technical advice with regard to afforestation is rather difficult to get. The average countryman knows very little about planting trees.  There may be a certain amount of care taken in planting the trees and in looking after <Col N="2276" /> the trees for a short time but after a while there is very considerable neglect and the trees start to grow wild for lack of attention and for lack of technical knowledge with regard to these matters.  If the Minister has any scheme in mind to increase the acreage under forests, particularly with regard to planting by private individuals, one of the first matters for consideration would be the provision of technical advice as to the best and most suitable lands, drainage, fencing and other relevant matters.  It would be futile to spend public money on work of this kind if the money is wasted in the long run.  I would strongly urge the Minister to make more technical advice available to the people concerned.  As other Deputies have suggested, the help of local committees, Macra na Feirme, Young Farmers' Clubs, committees of agriculture and other such organisations should be solicited for the promotion of this work.  These people, who have co-operated in everything that was good for the country, would be only too glad to co-operate in any way they can in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a big tract of land in the vicinity of Foxford.  I would mention particularly the Craggagh area in the vicinity of Craggagh cemetery. I was told by a forestry expert that there is a good lot of land there which is practically useless for any other purpose and that the soil in that area is ideal for forestry operations.  If the owners of that land were approached and if you could satisfy them with regard to price&mdash;knowing the people as I do I think they are reasonable people&mdash;I consider it would be of great advantage to that rugged mountainous area.  It is quite a nice tourist district, but definitely there is not enough of timber in the area.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  I should like to refer to and that is the question of State forests.  Certain development work was undertaken at Cong, County Mayo, some time ago and I was of the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that when that forest would be opened timber would be made available to the people of County Mayo at what I would regard as an economic price.  I have <Col N="2277" /> not heard that any timber from Cong has reached any private individual in Mayo.  As a matter of fact, my information is that merchants in other parts of the country are benefiting from this Cong forest.</P>

I do not intend to pursue a discussion that might traverse the whole field of forestry, but I do submit to the House that, without prejudice to the particular limitations I am putting on myself, the extent of the activities of the Department covered by this Supplementary Estimate does make it possible for Deputies to raise the whole subject.</P>
      <P>There are, however, specific sections of this Estimate which are giving me considerable trouble.  I do not mean that in the sense of any objection to the Minister getting the unanimous support of the Dáil for further moneys for forestry.  My feeling on the issue of forestry is that we should support in every way possible a Minister seeking money for expansion in that direction. But I was rather amazed in regard to one specific sub-head.  The Minister may not have adverted to it.  I refer to sub-head C 2 (2)&mdash;Capital Expenditure (initial preparation and drainage of ground, road construction, and buildings): materials, £1,000; cartage and freight, £2,500.  There seems to be some lack of co-ordination in regard to that particular item&mdash;£1,000 for materials and £2,500 for cartage and freight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not told us.  How can we recognise anything when the Minister has not told us?  I am putting the question for the purpose of eliciting from the Minister if some peculiar circumstances arose by which at the end of the year the charge by way of freight and cartage will be in the ratio of 2.5 to 1 for materials. It may be that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for that, but we as Deputies, not having got that information and trying to discharge our duties in this House, are perfectly entitled to seek an explanation when we see a blunt analysis on the back of an Estimate without any explanation.</P>
      <P>As far as the Fine Gael Party is concerned, we welcome any impetus to the development of forestry.  Unlike either Deputy Blowick or Deputy Morrissey, however, I have a feeling that the time has come for us to have a slightly different outlook on forestry generally.  I can appreciate very readily the difficulties that may arise in connection with the acquisition of land.  I can appreciate the difficulties that have arisen in connection with the acquisition of land, particularly commonage, much of which in the main is not used at all.  The Minister has a duty to discharge.  I feel it is time that the farmers, and particularly the farmers in areas where there is land more suitable for timber growing than anything else, were made fully aware of the fact that an investment of their money in growing timber will in the last analysis reap for them a richer harvest than will the placing of that money on deposit receipt in a bank.</P>
      <P>I am not in accord with certain types of appeals made here about increased grants.  The type of increased grant that the Minister will give to encourage afforestation by the farmers themselves is that commensurate with what is necessary provided the Minister and his Department can properly impress upon the minds of the farmers the value to them of growing timber.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating an increase in grants at all.  That would have been shown had I been allowed to develop my argument.  I was directing the Minister's attention to the fact that, as far as grants are concerned, I believe that it is not the grant that is important but the conviction of and appreciation by those who may avail of such grants of the value of growing timber on their holdings.  Had we been less precipitate in our conception of the rules of order it would have been found that I was not going to discuss the question of grants except <i>en passant.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much play has been made here about the value of timber.  The Minister is an experienced member of this House. He is experienced in analysing Estimates and Supplementary Estimates because he acted for a time as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. <Col N="2282" /> With regard to conversion, there is no suggested saving, no suggested Appropriations-in-Aid and no reduction.  I thought the Minister would have indicated what exactly was being done.  I thought he would have told us whether large quantities of timber were being cut for storage purposes, whether they were being put into some type of reserve or going through some process of development which would require a certain period of time and because of which no return could be shown to the Exchequer by way of moneys earned through the sale of timber.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey on the question of the development of State forests and particularly in regard to the utilisation of thinnings.  We import immense quantities of raw wood material.  Much of the publicity that so many of us seek appears ultimately in print on a wood basis.  Wood pulp is very important in the production of newsprint.  There must be an avenue for exploration in technical development in relation to the use that can be made of all types of waste from State forests.  I feel these are the industries that the State should really get to grips with because they will be germane to the economy of the country as a whole.  Possibly the Minister will deal with the matter when the main Estimate for his Department comes before the House and I throw out the suggestions now in the hope that he will give us that information in due course.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has successfully co-ordinated a plan to bring about a more useful type of supervision and greater expedition in the thinning of our young forests. Apparently, a good deal still remains to be done.  Possibly there are technical difficulties to be faced.  If there are not technical difficulties and if it is possible to do the work of thinning with not too skilled labour working under proper supervision the Minister need have no hesitation in coming to the House to ask for whatever money he requires to give an impetus to thinning.  We would welcome such a proposal because it would mean more employment apart from eliminating the <Col N="2283" /> danger that our forests might become clogged because of delay in carrying out thinning operations.</P>
    <P>We must be more realistic in our approach to reafforestation.  Some people look upon forests as a wonderful world of green trees while others regard them merely as something from which they can reap tremendous profits. What is the general position now governing the availability of the young trees that the Minister found difficulty in procuring in previous years?  Has the situation generally eased and what is the situation from the point of view of the Department in relation to likely supplies equating against land available for planting?</P>
    <P>I am interested in the question of the acquisition of land and possibly might be more verbose on the main Estimate than on this.  As this Estimate provides specifically for certain moneys in addition to the acquisition of land, I would press the Minister to come to the House as early as possible with suggestions to obviate some of the difficulties he has in regard to acquisition, particularly on the title side.</P>
    <P>I do not know what one might say with regard to acquisition of commonage. As we know, a good deal of the land available in the heart of Ireland that would normally be suitable for planting, comes under the category of either mountain common or marsh common.  I do not know if the Minister has any specific plan that might make such acquisition easier.  Unfortunately, you will find, as has been adverted to already, that one or two people may dig their heels in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick made an attempt, in the Land Bill he brought in in 1949 or 1950, to deal with the question of an apportionment of commonage in order to make certain parts of it available. The difficulty in regard to the acquisition of land which has arisen in the Minister's Department is twofold.  I do not say this in a spirit of criticism but the Department is archaic in its concept of a 300 acre minimum for operations.  I would say that the Minister and his very expert advisers could <Col N="2284" /> reorientate themselves to the situation without any great effort in order to appreciate that the development of forestry and of agriculture go hand in hand in this country.</P>
    <P>The days of being able to get these nice composite units that would give you the theorist's solution are gone and the Minister will have to approach the problem of getting as near as he can to an economic unit in areas, as distinct from laying down a specific unit.  When I say that, I say it in the special sense in which it applies to people living along the western seaboard and in my own constituency running from Inchigeela, Ballinageary, Ballyvourney, right through the backbone of the county into the Bere Peninsula itself.  What I am anxious about in that area is not so much that the Forestry Department should do the work as to have there a composite nursery unit at least from which all the people of that area would be able to draw such plants as they want for the purposes of their own forestry development.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the Minister in his Estimate at this stage.  I asked the Minister questions about the particular delineations and explanations of his Estimate not in a spirit of criticism or in any anxiety to embarrass him or, indeed, to question the Estimate.  I think the Minister will appreciate himself that, not in bad faith&mdash;I certainly would not like to imply bad faith&mdash;in the general statements, specific explanations which the House might reasonably expect were lost sight of. I would like him to give them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, though it might be more appropriate to leave the type of speech made by Deputy Blowick and Deputy Morrissey to the main Estimate, it might be well for the Minister to realise that in dealing with the Department of Forestry he is dealing with a Department for which the House in general has amazing goodwill. It is a Department on which there is general agreement for capital expenditure and I would suggest to the Minister seriously that he should contemplate forestry on the basis of doing the maximum that is within the capacity <Col N="2285" /> of himself and his Department and ever trying to increase that maximum outside of any financial considerations.  My real belief is&mdash;and I am sure it is the belief of anyone who is interested in the development of State forestry and in the planting of trees in this country&mdash; that in the ultimate analysis the trees will not only serve a useful purpose by way of ornamentation in the country, by way of wind barrier and wind breaking to protect and improve lower grazing patches or to maintain and preserve better quality and heart in the land, but that as each year progresses the value of that timber to the nation as a whole will appreciate and that at least when posterity comes to look upon the activities of those of our day who had advocated growing timber, they will have a practical realisation in the conversion of that timber into an asset in their day.</P>
    <P>I believe we should approach forestry on one basis only.  It is a really sensible bank in which to sink some of the Irish money and I would far sooner, as a counter to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs' army of occupation of pound notes in England, have a large and ever growing occupational force of growing young trees in Ireland ultimately to enhance the value of our homeland and not of anybody else's.</P>

      <P>The regrettable part about this Supplementary Estimate is that it comes so close to the annual Estimate which will be discussed here in the matter of a few weeks.  It is quite natural that Deputies will be anxious to speak in general about the policy of afforestation and most Deputies are inclined to be long-winded on a subject of this kind.  I do not propose to deal with this matter in detail as you have made a ruling, Sir, which curtails the discussion on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact and it is a healthy sign that the Minister is coming into the House even late in the day seeking a Supplementary Estimate of £70,000 over the regular Estimate last year.  I recognise, as I have always done over a period of years, the necessity for increasing afforestation.  Most Deputies <Col N="2286" /> who have contributed to this debate have referred to the Department of Forestry.  That is an oversight on their part, perhaps.  There is no Department of Forestry.  It is because there is no Department of Forestry that forestry has become the cinderella of the Land Commission.  We find ourselves criticising and asking the Minister to be more considerate in acquiring land and in increasing the amount required with a view to the expansion of afforestation.  I have on more than one occasion suggested the setting up of an independent department.  Deputy O'Hara, who spoke a few minutes ago, suggested a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Chair advised him that that would be a matter for the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, as I said, we shall leave that over to the annual Estimate.  The bone of contention in this Estimate, and I take it in the annual Estimate, will be the method of approach to the acquisition of land.  I agree to a certain extent with Deputy McQuillan that there is quite a lot in the method of approach and that apart from holdings of individual tenants, there are big areas of commonage running into hundreds of acres held by many tenants.  It is to the method of approach in endeavouring to acquire such commonage with a view to having it planted, after allowing reasonable compensation to those holding commonage rights, that the forestry section should direct attention.  I am sure that is what Deputy McQuillan had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any Deputy would be so insane as to suggest the acquisition of any tenant's holding by compulsion but as I say there are vast areas of commonage the acquisition of which might be considered for this purpose.  For instance, adjacent to the road from Ballaghaderreen to Charlestown, there are 300 acres of land on a hillside known as Mullaghanoe and the tenants there have offered that land over a period of years to the Land Commission.  I wonder what approach the Land Commission made in that direction.  Again, in part of Kilmovee parish, there is a considerable area <Col N="2287" /> which was formerly occupied by a wood that was cut down when I was about 14 or 15 years of age.  That area would now be available for replanting.  You have also Sneehall in which there is not a tree growing.  Again between Kilkelly and Swinford, there is a considerable area in which there is scarcely a bush in existence.  An area of from 400 to 500 acres is available for reafforestation in the townlands of Barnacoogue, Shammer and Curryane.</P>
    <P>These townlands which are adjacent would provide a very considerable area in which a forest could be developed. Apart from the value of the timber itself the maintenance of these forests would provide employment for children yet unborn.  Permanent employment could be provided year in, year out for the present generation in the planting of these areas while, as I say, the maintenance of these plantations would provide employment for future generations.  The Land Commission is at present spending considerable sums in the reallocation of land held on the rundale system, in these areas, land which is fit for nothing else but afforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite frank, I am.  I consider it a waste of money. It would be much better to acquire that land for afforestation and to transfer the tenants to areas in which there is plenty of good arable land available for them.  Such land is available to-day in Meath and other counties.  I pass it twice a week and it is growing only furze.  Land Commission houses are actually being built on some of this land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making a passing reference to that fact in order to substantiate the point I made.  I think that instead of spending money on houses of that kind it would be much better to develop forestry villages for the development of forestry. Last year the Minister, in presenting <Col N="2288" /> his annual Estimate, left us in grave doubt because of the fact that he did not furnish us with a more detailed explanation of the plans of his Department. I hope that this year he will give that detailed explanation.</P>
      <P>The time has come, I think, when every Deputy and Senator should be presented with a booklet giving a detailed account of the operations of the forestry section of the Department and giving an outline of the manner in which the large sums of money paid out for the development of forestry each year are expended so that we might be able to speak with more authority on these Estimates.  Nobody wishes to be parochial in a matter of this kind.  It is a national problem and we wish to approach it from a national standpoint.  The time has therefore come when the forestry section of the Department should present Deputies and Senators with a book giving a full detailed account of the operations of the Department.</P>

      <P>I suggest that there is a sum of money provided in this Estimate for the acquisition of land. There is a sum of £7,000 provided in the Estimate for the acquisition of land in addition to the amount provided in the main Estimate at the beginning of the year.  I should like to know the purpose for which the Minister requires his £7,000.  I do not know where he is going to acquire the land. I take it that it is somewhere in the Twenty-Six Counties but we do not know whether it is arable land, grazing land or rugged mountain.  We are left in the rather peculiar position that we cannot offer any criticism or any assistance in a matter of this kind. The Minister simply walks into the House with a vague suggestion.  I should like to know what would happen if I walked into a bank and asked the manager for a loan of £7,000 without specifying what I intended to do <Col N="2289" /> with it or how I proposed to repay it. I do not think the manager would give me the loan unless I explained specifically the purpose for which I required it or what the results of the investment were likely to be.  The Minister walks in here and give us no explanation.</P>

I shall conclude by saying that I am prepared to associate myself with the remarks of those who have welcomed the Minister's Supplementary Estimate, but I hope that when he comes before us in a few weeks' time, he will be in a position to give a more detailed account of the whole working of his Department for the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming this Estimate because I think we are all agreed that afforestation is one of the main things upon which we have to fall back in this country.  It means profit for the future, it means wealth for the country, it means employment and it means that any debts we may incur will be refunded, both capitally and otherwise, in the years to come.  I am afraid I am not in full agreement with some of the methods adopted by the Department for the last few years.  It seems to me that it is a very short-sighted policy in the acquisition of land not to take any land that is offered which is suitable for afforestation.  I gathered from the discussions which I heard to-day that it seems to be accepted now in the Forestry Department that it is not economic to take over any area of less than 300 acres or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will try the Minister's patience a little further by asking him what he means by adjacent? Would the Minister clarify what he means by an area being adjacent to a forestry centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Within three miles.  If they get, say, 30 or 40 acres or even less I would say three miles roughly speaking.  They would be glad to get it at such a distance that the forester would be able to manage it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it to be a little more economic to go a bit further than three miles?  Modern means of transport are very facile nowadays as compared with what they were.  We have had several instances in my own constituency where the Forestry Department were offered land that is of no value for anything else whatsoever for the purpose of planting.  I am sure the Minister will accept the fact that it is extremely difficult for the ordinary private individual to plant an area of, perhaps, some 50 or 60 acres.  I can give the Minister instances in County Wexford where land was actually offered to the Forestry Department and where there was a forest centre within five miles or so.  The particular farmer concerned indicated that he was not in a position, as he owned a tillage farm which he had to work in order to increase production, to replant this land.  It was not that he was not in a position to do so from the financial point of view.  He simply had not the time available to do the work.  It seems to me that it is short-sighted policy, when it is so difficult for the Department of Forestry to obtain land, if the Department does not readily jump to take land offered to them which is suitable for afforestation.</P>

      <P>Did the Deputy see the forestry branch about the particular case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already notified the Forestry Department and asked them to take over this section of land. I was told that it was not economic to do so simply because it was not a big enough area.</P>
      <P>It contains 50 acres of land and is a cut-down wood suitable for nothing else but planting.  It is within a radius of about six miles at the very outside, if it is even that, of a forestry centre.  I think it is very short-sighted of the Department not to take this over.  I force my arguments home by adverting to the fact that, in the place where I live in Wexford, I have had to endure the sight of the Forestry Department planting arable land, land which I have seen in my childhood growing beet, wheat, barley and oats. It is as good arable land as there is in Ireland.  I cited the instance where the Department are offered 50 acres and will not take it.</P>
      <P>I could bring the Minister down to my constituency and show him 200 acres of arable land which has been afforested.  Of course that is finished and done with now.  We cannot go in and pull up those trees.  I have seen an arable field adjoining my own farm at home afforested with beech trees right out to the middle of the field itself. Is there any sense in that?  In 250 years' time those trees will probably be matured.  Is it any wonder that farmers are not interested in afforestation? Is it any wonder that they do not take the right interest in afforestation and that they do not go in for afforestation themselves when they see a Department carrying out a policy such as this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  I am stating this policy.  The Department of Lands know that has happened.  I told them that repeatedly.  I told them before I was elected as a Deputy and I told them since I was elected, but they have taken no notice of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the emergency, when we <Col N="2292" /> farmers were forced to till our land under an emergency Order&mdash;I am not disputing that it was not essential at the time&mdash;I asked the Department what explanation they had to offer for afforesting arable land in a national emergency.  Were they not bound by the ordinary tillage regulations just the same as any other citizen in this country?  The answer I got was that they did their quota of tillage elsewhere. They probably did, but it does not cover the fact that they were doing an act that they should not have done. Worse than that, they were setting a bad example to the farmers in the country as a whole on the question of afforestation.</P>
    <P>I know that the Forestry Department are doing very good work in this country.  I know that over the past ten years or so there has been a very serious attempt in this country to carry out a proper policy of afforestation. The fact that we are backward and slow in regard to afforestation is due to the fact that the policy, dating back to the days of the British Government, was not a proper policy of afforestation.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate we have a sum for the acquisition of land.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the fact that any land he can get, no matter where he can get it, which is for the purpose of afforestation should be acquired by him. Even if it will cost the Department a little extra money to do so, it is a good and sound national policy.  Apart from what we can get out of the land itself the only thing we can fall back on in this country is afforestation.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about afforestation in the Gaeltacht.  My experience of the Gaeltacht in the West of Ireland and in Donegal is purely that of a tourist travelling to these places.  It seems to me that we have in those areas bog containing a tremendous amount of turf.  I think it is very doubtful whether we will ever be able to use all this fuel in the country.  The land to which I refer&mdash; this bogland&mdash;is very suitable for afforestation.  I think that the Forestry Department should concentrate on the West of Ireland.  They should drain the land there in part for afforestation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> I would suggest to the Minister that in so far as any further acquisition of land by him is concerned he should concentrate on areas such as those which I have mentioned.  He should also concentrate upon the higher rugged land which is gradually becoming denuded of soil.  There comes a time&mdash;unfortunately it has come in a great many areas in this country&mdash;when you cannot sow timber because the land is simply arid and there is nothing to hold the roots in the soil.</P>
    <P>The only matter really upon which I join issue with the Forestry Department is this.  They should get out of arable land and have nothing to do with arable land except in so far as they require it for nurseries.  I appreciate the fact that a certain section of land is required for that purpose and that is the end of it.  Here and now the Minister should adopt definitely the idea that if there is any arable land vacant&mdash;and I appreciate that often when he is buying arable land he is buying it in conjunction with another parcel of land that is fit for afforestation&mdash;it should be handed back to the Department concerned with arable land.  This branch should concern itself only with the ordinary land that is suitable for afforestation&mdash;excepting, of course, that required for nurseries, as I have mentioned already.</P>
    <P>Great advances have been made in afforestation.  Every Deputy appreciates that it is one of the things which will really be of lasting benefit to the nation.  It will help to absorb our people, give them employment and keep them at home.  It will help, above all, to build up in Ireland what we want here, the raw materials for the industries of the future.  It will help also to safeguard us against any loans or debts that may accrue in this country.  We will have behind us always the feeling that, as the years go on, these forests will grow up and they will be something to fall back on as so many European countries found in recent years, that the forests are the wealth and the main resource behind agriculture in any country, particularly one such as Ireland.</P>
    <Col N="2294" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the Castlerea area, County Roscommon, where there was a proposal two years ago to acquire some 240 acres.  I would like to know how far progress has been made in acquiring that tract of waste land and I would like to have it pushed on as quickly as possible.  There is very considerable unemployment in that area at present, as a result of Bord na Móna discontinuing turf production. Anything the Minister can do to expedite the matter would be very much appreciated.  The land itself is of no great value and I am sure the compensation demanded would be purely nominal.  I do not see anything in the way of acquiring that tract and it would provide very great employment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said regarding the difficulty of supervision of forests, but it is a pity he would not alter the policy on the acquisition of smaller tracts.  In County Roscommon and other counties there are several small tracts readily available for afforestation, but the fact that the Department is inclined to concentrate on 300-acre tracts is holding up the matter.</P>
      <P>The forestry section offer a rather unfair price in many instances for land.  I know theirs is a long-term programme and will take a long time to yield dividends, but when they do come in they will be big dividends and the work will repay future generations. The present approximate value, £4 an acre, being offered by the Department is probably keeping out of the Minister's hands a lot of land which would be available if a more reasonable price were offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into the point Deputy Finan has mentioned.  As regards smaller tracts, it is a pity the county councils would not take some responsibility in encouraging afforestation locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Esmonde that we ought to plant every acre we can get, but the trouble of fencing those places and taking care of them is rather substantial.  I must confess I do not know what the reason is in the particular case he has mentioned. <Col N="2295" /> Where there seem to be reasonable prospects of expansion we have not been debarred by distance from the nearest centre.  When we went into counties like Donegal or Leitrim, where in the opinion of the forestry branch there were good prospects of expansion, the soil seemed to be fairly suitable and we were not encroaching on agriculture in any way, we were not stopped by distance.</P>
    <P>If the acquisition inspector, having gone round the area, felt that the land was going to come in&mdash;as has happened in East Donegal, where we are making fairly good progress&mdash;we did not allow ourselves to be held up by mere distance.  If, however, we are going into some agricultural area like Wexford, which is overwhelmingly agricultural, and the amount available for new plantation or the amount of old plantation coming into our hands is very limited, it is a question whether it is worth devoting our energies to it.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy sends me particulars of any case such as that mentioned by Deputy Esmonde, I can promise to have the inspector visit the area. While the inspector is quite prepared to go into a particular area and inquire, our staff is limited and&mdash; unless we get assistance from Deputies and others to help them out and enable us to get a strong foothold in a particular area&mdash;it may be that it would be better from the point of view of progress, to leave these acquisition inspectors in the areas where they are making fairly good progress.  If Deputies can direct me to particular persons with whom they think it might be possible to come to agreement, I would be glad to do it; but when general appeals are made that a particular area needs attention, I am afraid we cannot reach on them all.</P>
    <P>One of the things I am very conscious about is that a heavy burden has been thrown on the administrative staff.  We have about 155 centres, we are operating in nearly every county, and that means a tremendous amount of travel.  It means that we are really over-reaching ourselves, I think, if we try to continue to expand into further areas.  Some process of consolidation <Col N="2296" /> is necessary and the expansion ultimately will not be held up in any way by consolidating what we have and establishing ourselves on a firm footing where we are already in possession. The experience that we will gain in that way in the more concentrated areas will be all to our benefit later on, and if the acquisition of land goes ahead we will have this three years' reserve that we would like to have.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on the main Estimate that with regard to a certain number of the plantations there is no great prospect of land coming in.  In a further number, the prospects are not very good and there may be 50 or 60 plantations where the prospects for expansion are very good.  The policy of the branch is to try and provide regular employment and there is no use in saying that we are doing that by going into an area and starting off planting a few hundred acres this year and a few hundred more next year and then having to leave. Regarding these large areas to which reference has been made in the West of Ireland, like North Connemara, the Ox Mountains and West Donegal, anywhere there are areas in which the layout of the land is suitable and the exposure is not very severe, I would like naturally that we would make more progress in those areas, if we could get substantial tracts of land.</P>
    <P>I would have no hesitation in going to the Government and asking for a great deal more money, if I could see these tracts coming in, but what I see is that, in these areas, the Ox Mountains or Leitrim, we have to approach individual land holders, who are very small people, and have to bargain with them about their few acres and about their commonages, and the older they are, I suppose, the more difficult it may be to come to agreement with them.  Certainly, as has been stressed in the debate, anybody who thinks that the ordinary small farmer in the West is going to give up his few acres with his mountain commonage without driving a hard bargain is making a very serious mistake.</P>
    <P>We are naturally driven, therefore, if we want to make progress, to the <Col N="2297" /> areas where we think we can get the land.  There are a few areas which are more promising than others.  For example, as I have said, Donegal is good; Laois is fairly good; the western areas are rather slow; Cork and Kerry are described as very good; North-West Clare and Tipperary, fairly good; and Limerick rather slow.</P>
    <P>We make some progress in Clare and Galway, but not as much as we would wish, but, generally speaking, the overall picture is that it is not easy to get land in the West, unless we go up the mountainside.  I think there is a certain amount of land, derelict holdings and so on, that could be got, so that the Forestry Department would not be driven entirely, in the case of expansion in the West, on to the hazardous and very exposed areas running up to 1,000 feet or more.  In this matter, if Deputies can give me any assistance, I shall be very glad indeed to have it and to co-operate with them, if they think that more can be done in their areas.</P>
    <P>Although the general question of grants to farmers was ruled out of the discussion by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like to say, since the debate has covered a rather wide field and speakers like Deputy Morrissey have referred in particular to the importance of arousing a feeling amongst our own people, and particularly our farmers, as to the advantages of afforestation, that there are planting schemes for farmers under both the Forestry Department and the Department of Agriculture.  If I am not trespassing too much on the rules of order, I should like to say that we have a scheme of which I do not think great advantage is being taken.  It may be that, if the grants were increased, more advantage might have been taken of it, but I think that we have reached a stage now, in spite of what Deputy O'Hara has said, that merely increasing the grant is no proof either that the scheme is good or that advantage is going to be taken of it. The point is that if people are interested in planting trees, they have these two schemes, one run by the forestry branch and the other by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Looked at from the educational <Col N="2298" /> point of view, so to speak, we find that the trees are supplied at half cost by that Department; the planting is supervised by the county instructor of horticulture; and the maximum number of trees supplied is 1,000.  Still, we find that only about £100, representing half the cost of the trees, is the average annual county grant, meaning that about 25,000 trees, or possibly 15 to 20 acres, are planted every year.  It will be seen that we have a great way to go and I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Morrissey's point of view that more could be done locally.  The forestry branch are quite prepared to give advice where necessary. They have an advice scheme under which private persons can always obtain the advice they need in regard to tree-growing.  If the inspector has to spend a whole day or give priority to the inspection at the owner's request, we will charge a fee of £2.  Otherwise, there is no fee. Where a planting grant is sought, free advice is given.  So much for assistance with regard to advice and so on.</P>
    <P>Every county committee of agriculture has horticultural instructors to give advice and if the county committees come forward with proposals to the Minister for Agriculture or to myself by which the existing schemes could be improved and more interest aroused in local schemes of afforestation in relation to farmers taking more advantage of them, we shall be very glad to go into the matter, but I must warn the House that it must not be merely a question of looking for more money.  We must be satisfied that, in fact, the scheme is worth while, and that advantage will be taken of it.  I am afraid that at present all the experience and knowledge I have incline me to the view that advantage is not being taken of the schemes and that farmers, apart from a very exceptional one, are not interested in afforestation. They think, as is implicit in Deputy Esmonde's remarks, that to the extent that afforestation may be claiming arable land, the interests of afforestation are perhaps directly antagonistic to theirs.  I think they are wrong in that, but it is a widespread feeling and a feeling which is not confined to this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> We have not got a tradition with regard to afforestation, of people living in forests or getting their livelihoods in forests, as in Germany and other continental countries, and we still have to do a great deal by way of educational propaganda to build up a feeling about forestry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick again referred to the 25,000 acres programme of the inter-Party Government.  I mentioned on the main Estimate last year that, while there is no doubt there was discussion about a 25,000 acre programme and it may have been a Government decision to try to get such a programme, 20,000 acres were the most that was sought to be obtained.  I explained to the House that I did nothing whatever to interfere with the programme that was there when I came in.  The attempt was not to get 25,000 acres but to get 20,000 acres.  That failed.  It was not possible &mdash;with the organisation at our disposal, the reserves of land that were there and the fact that these reserves had to be spread throughout the 150 centres or so&mdash;to build up the 20,000 acres.  With the forestry branch doing everything possible to the very limit of their powers, including the fact that they were able to do about 5,000 acres of preparation by mechanical means which had not been possible in former years, 15,000 was what was accomplished.</P>
    <P>I could have said to the House last year: &ldquo;We will do 15,000 acres and go up by 2,000 or 5,000 acres a year.&rdquo;  I would like to do that but we have to get the land.  We have to have a very large reserve of land and it has to be properly distributed with regard to the centres.  You may be purchasing land at the present time in Donegal or Connemara which you cannot use for years.  You want to start off in an experimental way with some hundreds of acres of land to see what progress you will make.  If you have 2,000 or 3,000 acres in the Cloosh Valley or Gweedore are you going to plant these and let the whole thing develop&mdash;and perhaps be a failure?  We want to see, with regard to these new areas where soil and exposure are limiting factors, how we are getting on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2300" /> The Cameron Report merely said that there should be a social forestry programme roughly equivalent to the programme for commercial forests but no information was given to us.  It seems to be a question of how much money you are prepared to lose or&mdash; if &ldquo;lose&rdquo; is not a suitable term for a Minister in charge of forestry to apply to it&mdash;how much money the country is going to put into social forests.  We are spending about £1,000,000.  We will not get any very substantial return for a long time to come.  It is quite true that we have been getting some return from thinnings. That was due to the fact that one particular factory, as the House knows, was taking these thinnings with the result that we were estimating that we would get about £170,000 in appropriations this year, and probably we shall get that amount.  The fact is that there has been a decline in the market for thinnings and we do not know to what extent it will revive.  I have every hope that it will revive.  If it revives, it will show that employment in the utilisation of forest products will be given at a comparatively early stage, and it will show that&mdash;as various Deputies have emphasised in their speeches&mdash;we can turn our products into manufactures at a comparatively early stage.  For that reason, it is a matter of great importance whether or not the wallboard factory and the paper mills will take the produce, as they have been doing up to the present.  There has been some falling off.  We do not sell directly to these institutions.  We sell through agents.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked by Deputy Blowick whether we should not have more saw-mills.  There is a question there, I think, as to whether saw-mills which would go into the commercial business and into trade, as it were, was the intention.  You can say that it was not the intention or you can say that it was the intention.  To the extent that these saw-mills are ancillary and necessary to the work of thinning and forest maintenance, you can make a case for them but when you come to the disposal of the produce, and so on, you are bound to be up against the objection that you are <Col N="2301" /> competing with private firms in the same business.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about Shelton Abbey.  The adaptation of the building as a forestry school has proved a bigger job than we anticipated.  The Board of Works are actively pursuing plans to make a thorough job of the adaptation and it is hoped to have the building ready by autumn of next year. There are about 40 trainees and a third group of 20 are about to take up duty. The present plans for recruitment over at least some years envisage about 20 trainees a year.</P>
    <P>Not all of the timber at Shelton Abbey is of first-class quality.  In fact, little cutting has so far taken place but exploitation of the timber stands will be pursued in the normal course as they reach full maturity.  The forest could not in itself make a significant contribution towards meeting the requirements of a big saw-mill.  The position is that only 20 per cent. of the timber there is regarded as commercial&mdash;possibly less.  The other 80 per cent. is described as firewood. The total area is 924 acres, comprising 359 acres of woodland and 33½ acres of scrub.  It was estimated that there were 750,000 cubic feet of firewood and only 170,000 cubic feet of commercial timber.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Collins asked me about materials and cartage.  The position is that, under the original Estimate, we spent £10,000 on materials&mdash;to which we are now adding £1,000, making £11,000.  The original Estimate in respect of cartage was £6,000&mdash;to which we are now adding £2,500, making £8,500 for cartage.  The high cartage costs, I am informed, arise from the expansion of road-making in preparation for thinning.  Expansion in road-making is over twice last year's rate.  Having emphasised the importance of thinning and having taken steps to accelerate the work as far as I could, in the visits I have made to the forests where thinning is in progress, I was pleased to find that we had made very great strides with regard to roads.  But there are forests &mdash;and some of the earliest plantations, sown back nearly as far as the beginning of the first world war&mdash;where <Col N="2302" /> not alone had thinning not been maintained properly but where even roads had not been constructed to get the thinnings out.  Since, in any case, these will presumably be permanent centres, we have to get roads&mdash;and a considerable amount of our Budget will have to go on road-making.  The foresters and inspectors deserve congratulation on having done so well with regard to the construction of roads.  Even where they are being done by manual labour, it seems to me that the results are very satisfactory indeed.  But a great deal more has to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan raised the question of further development in the West of Ireland.  The Land Commission is doing a great deal in Roscommon, Mayo and other counties on the work of land rearrangement.  I feel that we cannot do both things in the same area.  We have also the land project: a certain amount is being done under that scheme.  There are hopes that bog reclamation may be undertaken actually for agricultural purposes&mdash;and the forestry branch have had to have that in mind.  One of the matters mentioned in the Cameron Report was that the future use of land, even bogland, should be a matter for consultation between the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to acquisitions in Kiltullagh or in any other area, there is first the point that these commonages, which belong traditionally to the smallholdings, are not easy to acquire. The advantage of going out, even into the mountains where the forestry branch will have full freedom of development, is that this question of accessibility and the question of local rights are not so serious.  You have to wait until you get the agreement of all the persons affected in the commonage, and it might take generations, even though you get part of the commonage rights, before you had secured the whole of them.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of local reserve.  If it is obvious, since the area is a small farming area, that no very large amount of land is likely to come in eventually for forestry purposes&mdash; nothing in the nature of 1,000 acres or <Col N="2303" /> more&mdash;the question is whether we are justified in giving our attention to these areas; but if, as has been suggested by the Deputy, there are, contiguous to these smallholdings which are more or less derelict, substantial areas which are suitable for afforestation, we can have them inspected if he will take the trouble of putting us in touch with the owners concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey also referred to the outcry about taking land.  We have examples of that.  We heard Deputy Esmonde on it to-day, and recently the case down in Kinnitty, in which several Deputies are interested, on which the local county council passed a resolution condemning the forestry branch for taking land which would have been useful for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>According to the local forester, any of the people who are looking for land in Kinnitty would have been glad to get it but there was one thing they were certain of.  It was this: that the land which the Offaly County Council thought should be taken for division they did not want&mdash;they did not want it under any circumstances, because a previous owner had ploughed it up and had got practically no return from it. It is quite obvious that there were no grounds&mdash;only pure mischief&mdash;for suggesting that the Forestry Department were taking land away from people in that or in any other case.</P>
    <P>Might I remind Deputies that there is a Department&mdash;I am sure Deputy Esmonde knows it&mdash;the Land Commission, which has very formidable powers for taking land for the relief of local congestion or for bringing in migrants?  How it could happen then that the forestry people could take land, while there is another Department there for the purpose of settling families on such land, rather defeats me.</P>
    <P>There may have been one or two such cases in Wexford, but the general position is that, as regards a large amount of the land which is eventually acquired, it comes to the forestry branch through the Land Commission, and, as in the case of the Kinnitty land, <Col N="2304" /> it is land that we are assured by the Land Commission is over and above their requirements for the purpose of relieving local smallholders or others.</P>
    <P>With regard to Castletownbere, or any other area, if Deputy Collins will send up particulars of the areas to which, in his opinion, more attention might be given with the probability of progress from the acquisition point of view, I shall be glad to have them examined.  As regards his point about seeds, I think we have more than enough seeds for our needs.  Where we are short of a particular species, then, by means of an exchange arrangement with other countries we can generally make up our programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the West of Ireland, the important point is that for many years, as Deputies who are interested in the matter know, the complaint was that the prospects of afforestation there were damaged by the failure, either deliberate or through carelessness, of a planting done some 40 years ago. We had an example of that at Ballyhoura, North Cork, where we had to replant a plantation that had been a failure, about which high hopes were entertained when it was originally planted.  I would ask Deputies, therefore, who are pressing for the utmost possible planting acreage in the West of Ireland to remember that, from our experience in the past, we do not want to plant the whole of what we have and then leave ourselves without any rotation as regards employment.  We would like at least to be able to keep the men we have&mdash;not to take men on for a season or two and then have to let them go again.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points that were raised in the debate. I can promise Deputies that the matters which they mentioned and to which I have not referred in my reply, will be gone into in the Department. I shall ask the forestry branch to try to consider them.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word in conclusion, arising out of my reply to Deputy Blowick yesterday when he asked me for the present position about the land acquired during the past year.  I told him that we have acquired some 15,000 acres of which nearly 14,000 acres were <Col N="2305" /> considered to be plantable.  I also told him that there were over 47,000 acres not yet inspected, and that the area for which offers had been made, but not yet accepted, was 37,000 acres.  There is a further figure which he did not ask me to give but which may interest him.  It is that there are 25,000 acres on which price agreements have been reached.  These agreements are now in the hands of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £75,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite will recollect that an undertaking was given in January, 1951, jointly with the Six-County authorities, to the Great Northern Railway Company, that financial assistance would be provided for the company to the extent that its resources proved insufficient to meet the liabilities incurred in maintaining its existing services and appropriate employment. In accordance with that <Col N="2306" /> undertaking, provision was made in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce for the payment of £200,000 towards meeting the operating losses and revenue charges of the company in the present financial year.  That sum has proved to be insufficient to meet our share of the loss and it is estimated that a further sum of £145,000 will be required before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Against that additional charge there are savings amounting to £70,000 on sub-head B of the Vote, savings due mainly to the fact that certain harbour works have not proceeded or have not been completed as early as possible, so that the net sum which the Dáil is now asked to vote is £75,000.</P>
    <P>An arrangement was made with the Six-County authorities for the allocation of payments, on foot of the undertaking to the company, between the two areas for the period pending the acquisition of the concern, which provided that we here should meet 40 per cent.  of the loss and the people in the North should meet 60 per cent.  It was agreed also at the time that we should have full credit for any profit and full responsibility for any loss arising on the road services operated by the company, all of which are in the Twenty-Six County area.</P>
    <P>There was also an understanding that any revenue resulting from an increase in fares authorised here would be credited to our account, but that does not affect the present situation because increases in fares have taken place in both areas.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate of £200,000 was, of course, based upon the company's estimate, prepared in January, 1951, of its operating results for the financial year.  As I have said, its losses have exceeded its estimate, due mainly to the fact that increased wages for workers became payable during the year, which affected its outgoings to the extent of £136,000 in respect of rail services and £31,000 in respect of road freight and road passenger services.  There were also increased charges for stores and fuel amounting to £91,000.</P>
    <P>Against these higher outgoings there was an estimated increase in revenue of £74,000, due presumably to <Col N="2307" /> the increase in the rates and fares put into operation, but receipts from both the road services and the catering services were less than was anticipated by £17,000 and £15,000 respectively. The road services of the company have shown a loss for the first time during the present year.</P>
    <P>The method for making payments on foot of the undertaking is different in each area.  The Six-County people pay fortnightly, replenishing the company's account as required, whereas we here guaranteed an overdraft to the company with its bankers and we have to make good within the financial year the extent to which that overdraft accommodation was called upon.  There is no option but to make the payment in view of the losses of the company and the undertaking given to them.</P>
    <P>The House will no doubt be anxious to know how the legislation for the joint acquisition of the undertaking stands.  I think it is possible to say that all the difficulties which have delayed progress have been removed, and I hope that the Bill will be introduced here before the end of the month, the aim being to have it discussed and enacted after the Easter recess.  The Bill will be published here simultaneously with publication in Belfast, and I would ask the Dáil not to press me to give an indication of its character in any detail because it would be contrary to the arrangement to publish the details here in advance of their publication in Belfast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us are glad to learn from the Minister that the necessary legislation for the acquisition of the G.N.R. is about to make its appearance.  I am aware, of course, that there were certain difficulties to be got over but, frankly, I was beginning to think that the delay was unreasonable. Therefore, I am glad to know that the Minister hopes to be in a position to introduce the legislation here at the same time as it will be introduced in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, of course, no intention whatever of asking the Minister to give any detailed information about the proposed legislation at present.  There is <Col N="2308" /> not very much one can say regarding the Supplementary Estimate itself except that the margin of difference between the estimate given to the Department by the G.N.R. and the actual amount required is, in my opinion, too great.  I understand that the greater part of the additional sum required is made up of an additional sum of £136,000 to meet increased wages.  Am I to take it that in the original estimate submitted by the company there was not a provision for increased wages or am I to take it that the provision for increased wages made in the original estimate was so far wide of the mark as to require an additional sum of £136,000?  It seems to me that the difference between the estimated figure and the actual figure with which we now have to deal, a jump of from £200,000 to £345,000, is far too much.</P>
    <P>I had intended to mention a few other points but, in view of the fact that the Minister has announced the early introduction of the legislation, it would perhaps be more fitting to leave them over until we have the legislation before us.  I am sure the House is glad to get that information from the Minister.  I am quite certain that those who are directly interested in this matter, the shareholders and those who depend for their livelihood on the G.N.R., will also be glad that the legislation is at long last to make its appearance.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, only fair to say that the difficulties which had to be met and overcome in connection with the preparation of legislation for this acquisition were not confined to ourselves; that there were also difficulties in the Six-County area and that they had to be met.  Then there had to be, I presume, a reconciling of the points of view both in the Six Counties and in our own State here.  I do not propose to ask the Minister any question about legislation at the moment, as I would prefer to wait until I see it.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse the remarks of Deputy Morrissey in connection with the statement of the Minister that the legislation is to be introduced before <Col N="2309" /> the end of the month.  I hope that nothing will occur either here or in Belfast which will prevent that promised legislation being introduced this month.  The Minister did mention, however, one matter in connection with the losses which the Great Northern have had to meet, that in the current year a loss for the first time was experienced on the road services section.  That is a rather alarming development, and I would be glad if the Minister could indicate to the House the causes of that development or the circumstances in which it occurred.  It would indicate that the position which had obtained no longer exists and that some change in circumstances has caused that development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate prepared by the company in January, 1951, upon which the Vote for the financial year was based, took into account all increases in wages which had then been agreed to or which were in sight, but the increase which was granted later in the financial year was, of course, not foreseen at that time and not taken into account, and the higher loss upon the railway operation was attributable mainly to it.  There was, of course, some hope that the increases in fares which were introduced simultaneously with the increase in wages would offset it, but, in fact, whereas the increases in wages amounted to £135,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the increases in receipts were equal to about half.  The additional loss on the railway operation was higher than estimated by £201,000.  I am afraid that the emergence of the loss on the road services is also due to increased wages which became payable during the year.  The road services, which were originally estimated to produce a profit, produced a loss.  That, of course, affects our payment under the undertaking directly because we are responsible for the whole of that loss, as we should have taken the credit for the whole of any profits.</P>

We included in the arrangement an undertaking that we could deduct from our 40 per cent. any profits made on the road services, and profits were being made at the time.

      <P>On the Money Resolution I should like to say that, while it <Col N="2311" /> is the responsibility of the board of the National Stud to run the stud under the Statute, the Minister did indicate that consideration had been given to the need for further capital before this proposed purchase was contemplated. That may or may not be accepted.  It is significant, however, that no proposal was brought forward here.  I think the Minister should indicate to the board of the stud that as far as possible they should endeavour in the immediate future to provide out of their own resources whatever capital is required by running the stud at a profit.</P>
      <P>The other suggestion on the matter which I should like to make is that the acquisition of this particular animal and the acquisition of two other sires already, Royal Charger and Preciptic, was an effort to provide a particular type of high class bloodstock which the country requires and for which probably the resources of many individual breeders would not allow them to compete.  It is not in the interests of the industry generally that the stud should provide sires of which there is an abundance in the country.  That may be a detail which it is better to leave to the board of the stud.  On the other hand, where public money is being voted we should endeavour, first of all, to get the best return possible, and, secondly, to cater for the type of bloodstock that only some of the private studs or individual breeders are in a position to buy.  I think the stud should not provide sires or bloodstock which a great number of persons in this country are already able to provide or have available for the use of breeders.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party have already made their position on this Bill very plain and propose to do so on every stage.  Our objection to this purchase at this time, as I indicated before, is based upon our conviction that the Government have lost all sense of proportion in relation to expenditure and to the importance of things.  Our objection is given even more weight and point by the announcement to-day of the unemployment figures.  Unemployment has increased by 1,000 persons since we were discussing this matter last week.  The published figures for the week ending 28th <Col N="2312" /> February are 89,579.  Any Deputy who has been in contact with his constituents, regardless of what their affiliations are, will agree that the country is receiving this step with absolute disgust.  The majority of the people feel that it is just one further example of the loss of contact with the ordinary people which has been displayed by this Government on so many occasions.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading we discussed very fully the views of this Party.  We made them perfectly clear despite the fact that the Minister tried to shroud the real purpose of this Bill and to conceal, though his effort was futile, that the real purpose of the Bill was to enable the Government in effect to purchase the racehorse, Tulyar.  He endeavoured to conceal that purpose by trying to limit the discussion on the Bill to the extension of the actual capital of the National Stud.</P>
      <P>It would be well for the Government now to admit frankly that this extension of capital is required for one purpose only, to buy a racehorse from the Aga Khan.  We have made our position in this matter very clear.  I do not think it needs any reiteration. It is a simple choice between the people and a racehorse.  Should we take a gamble with £250,000 of the taxpayers' money on a racehorse, which may be good or which may be bad? Should we take that step or should we invest that £250,000 for the purpose of improving the living standards of the people or providing work for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who is in touch with the people and who knows the difficulties under which they are living, the hardships they are enduring, the increased cost of living and the difficulty of procuring employment, is inundated with letters and requests from people who cannot get work anywhere at anything. Every Deputy must have had that experience. Every Deputy who has had that experience can only view this step by the present Government as completely unjustified and one which cannot be supported.  In making its attitude clear on this matter, the Labour Party is expressing the feelings of the majority of our people, <Col N="2313" /> and we do not propose to support this step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is fantastic to spend this sum on the purchase of a racehorse while at the same time expecting human beings to wade kneedeep in water on their way to Mass.  I think the principle underlying this is entirely wrong.  I have already made my attitude clear on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This step has been discussed at length and there is perhaps no advantage in delaying business at this stage.  On the one hand, we are thinking of spending £250,000 on a racehorse and, on the other hand, we know of many things on which this money could be expended to better advantage for the people as a whole. The Minister must realise the numbers signing on at the unemployment exchanges all over the country.  It is all very well to talk about planning for the future.  We know that in other countries they have had five-year plans.  A five-year plan is of very little advantage to the people who are crying out for work to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a responsible Minister, <Col N="2314" /> a member of a responsible Government, asking for the provision of £250,000 in order to buy a racehorse while in the labour exchanges in Cork City and throughout the entire Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now endeavouring to discuss unemployment and that is quite irrelevant. The whole ambit of Government policy might be discussed by contrast if that method were adopted and that cannot be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently we are in a position to spend £250,000 on a racehorse at a time when essential commodities are increasing in price every day.  If we have £250,000 to spend the question arises as to whether it is advisable to spend that money in the way suggested on something which may be advantageous in the very distant future.  If all were well with the country this expenditure might be justified, but surely the Minister will not go so far as to say that we can afford to spend at this juncture £250,000 on a horse no matter how great that horse is or how rosy we may paint the future when we have so many unemployed and when we are paying 4d. per lb. more for butter.  Let us have some common sense about this matter.  We have not got the money to spend on such a luxury at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made our position clear on the Second Reading of the Bill, and at this stage I merely want to appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole matter.  Is it wise in the present state of things, remembering the public outcry against this particular step on the part of the Government, to ask the House for £250,000 to purchase a racehorse?  I think it is an outrageous proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said by some of the previous speakers, this is a gamble with £250,000 of the taxpayers' money. The horse has been described as the world's best.  On the other hand, we do not know; he may be a complete dud.  I do not think he is a dud but the Minister should not take this step when everybody in the country, regardless <Col N="2315" /> of politics, is asking himself at the present time: how is it that the Government can calmly propose the expenditure of this sum for this particular purpose whereas when they are asked to provide money for other purposes they say that they have none? We hear of nothing but the appalling Book of Estimates, that no revenue is coming into the Exchequer, and that the country is bankrupt.  Every possible gloomy forecast that can be made is being made while at the same time we seem to have an endless supply of money for any foolish scheme.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister satisfied himself why one of the richest men in the world to-day is parting with this horse?  It cannot be said that he is selling the horse because he is short of money.  It has become a national joke up and down the country that this State which, a few years ago, accepted aid from the United States and was glad to get it&mdash; and all sides of the House expressed that opinion&mdash;is now in the happy position that it can bid against the richest States in the world for this horse. Personally I think it is a daft move and I do not believe the Government is wise in outraging public opinion as it is doing by proposing this expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is only last Saturday night we had the announcement that butter was up by 4d. a lb.  That may seem of very little consequence to the Government but it has hit every home in the country. A few days before that announcement was made we had this proposal to spend £250,000 on a racehorse. Actions like that are bringing this House into disrepute.  It is openly asking the people of this country to disregard the laws this House makes. We make laws governing every aspect of the life of the people in this country, some for their protection and some for their benefit, and some in regard to our relations with other countries. We ask the people to have respect for these laws, but the people can have respect for the laws only if we ourselves show a little common sense in carrying out the duties that are placed on us.  Asking this House to expend this sum of money for this <Col N="2316" /> particular purpose will have very far-reaching effects.</P>

In the course of his remarks the Minister has stated that this money which the House is about to provide is to build up the National Stud.  Deputy Dunne has very rightly stated that it is to build up the Aga Khan and people of that type.  I wish to have it placed on the records of this House that I oppose very strongly, and I dissociate myself in the strongest possible way from, this expenditure.</P>
      <P>On this Money Resolution I would ask the Minister if there is any foundation for the rumour, which has become widespread in recent weeks, that in addition to the purchase of Tulyar for £250,000, the Government are now considering the purchase of two other horses?</P>

I want the Minister <Col N="2319" /> to state clearly now whether the authorities responsible for purchasing Tulyar are now considering the purchase of two other animals for which this House will be asked to foot the bill.  It would be quite different if these purchases took place in the days of the inter-Party Government when we had a cost of living which was much lower than the present figure and when the number of unemployed was the lowest ever recorded.</P>

Whether the purchase of the animal is good or bad is another day's work.  What we must consider it that we are spending the taxpayers' money.  This House has been asked to vote this sum to build up the National Stud.  The National Stud is of very little use to the unemployed, to the thousands who cannot get work or to the harassed taxpayer.

We are now having an attempt to repeat the Second Reading debate, with a number of additions on the Money Resolution.  One would imagine from those who have spoken from the opposite benches that Fine Gael were acting as a Party in this matter, as Labour is, but there are divided counsels on the Fine Gael Benches. There are a number of the Fine Gael Party who are in favour of additional funds being provided for the National Stud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in favour of developing the National Stud in the interests of horse-breeding generally in the country.  I am amazed that at this hour of the day anybody would suggest in this House that the horse-breeding industry is not of paramount importance to this country and that it does not give employment.  The Minister, on Second Reading, indicated the value of the industry to the farmers and to the nation.  He pointed out the employment it provided in the growing of food for these valuable horses, the employment which the stud farm gives and the value derived from the export of live stock, in many instances for hard currency.  A great deal has been said about the individual from whom this horse was purchased. I think that is most unfair.  If the directors of the National Stud think the purchase of this horse is a good investment for them, it does not matter to us from whom they buy it, and I think it is most unfair to make <Col N="2321" /> such criticisms as were made of the individuals who were sufficiently fortunate to be able to breed a horse of the value that this horse possesses.</P>
      <P>The question we have to consider is that the National Stud was set up by the Government.  The directors manage a valuable piece of property and have a number of valuable animals.  They have given valuable service since this stud was established, and they have now reached a stage where they require increased capital to give increased value to the nation, over and above that which has already been given.  Deputy Blowick spoke about the 4d. per lb. increase in butter.</P>

The main purpose of this additional capital is to provide money for the purchase of this valuable animal but I want to say that there is no evidence of an outcry such as has been described.  I think the intervention of Deputy Flanagan is amazing.  He says that the curses of the unemployed will bring bad luck to this animal.  I think such conduct is foreign to the nature of our people.  I think the unemployed are just as <Col N="2322" /> anxious as the employed to see this country prosper and I do not believe that Deputy Flanagan's statement is true.  It is typical of the statements that we hear from the Deputy from time to time.  Deputies who are opposed to this Resolution should consider the question in a calm and deliberate way.  Is the National Stud under the control of directors who can be trusted with additional capital or is it not?  If it is, they should be given all necessary support and if it is not, the whole place should be closed down or the directors should be changed.  Nobody has found fault with the management of the National Stud. Not a single instance can be adduced here to show that they have had, at any time or in any way, mismanaged in the slightest any of their operations. I happen to know&mdash;and it is not a rumour&mdash;that they bought an animal for a sum of £12,000 and they could sell that animal to-morrow for £120,000. That is the sire, Royal Charger.</P>

I want to point out that that is good management, that they had the wisdom to pay £52,000, which undoubtedly was a large amount of money, for an animal which has proved itself a success and now, notwithstanding its increased age, they could sell it for £120,000.  That is good management.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is such an apt person to make statements which are untrue and without foundation that he knows he cannot believe himself and now he is beginning to disbelieve others.  It is only a person who deliberately states things <Col N="2323" /> which he knows to be true who will believe those things which are said by others.  When you do not speak the truth yourself you will not believe others.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter with a great number of people.  It has been given very wide publicity.  The sooner we finish deliberating on this matter, pass the Money Resolution and the Bill in its final stages, the more good we will do.  A number of people who spoke this evening also spoke on the Second Reading.  I have yet to hear a single criticism of the acts in the past of those who were responsible for operating the National Stud.  Nobody said that it has not done a good job since its inception.  Nobody wants it shut down.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick wants to back it each way.  He wants to be right if it should be a misfortune and he wants to be right if there is not.  He says that he does not know whether the horse which is to be purchased out of portion of this money will be any good or not.  He hopes it will be.  I do not understand that approach.  If I opposed it I would oppose it on the principles as I saw them and I would not try to hang my hat on two different pegs at the same time.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that when Deputy Dunne first took up this matter he thought it would be exceptionally good politics to agitate against this purchase on the ground that it was extravagant, wild, stupid expenditure. He thought he could relate it to the misery of some of our people who are unfortunate enough to be in certain circumstances.  I do not think that Deputy Dunne could show to this House any volume of telegrams or correspondence congratulating him on his stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why there should be so much excitement. Is it permissible for some people to walk on the toes of others and not permissible for those whose toes have been trod upon to do likewise?  It is all very well to hit me when I have my hands down and not when they are up.  Deputies opposite keep them up <Col N="2326" /> all the time.  I approached this problem as a responsible member of the House should.  We have an institution which is a business-like institution. Never once in this House in all the years since its establishment has any single action of that institution been questioned or condemned or criticised but when the time comes for a great development to take place which will produce good results for the country as a whole the opportunity is utilised for the purpose of attacking the Government as if the Government were taking £250,000 and throwing it down the drain.</P>
      <P>I am speaking with a full sense of the responsibility that I should take on here vis-á-vis my constituents.  I represent a working class constituency mainly.  I am quite satisfied that my constituents would be quite in favour of the line I have taken in this matter. I am not appealing to the lowest motives in people.  I am judging the matter in the manner in which we should judge matters connected with national affairs.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a good move.  I hope that whatever purchases the National Stud make will be crowned with success.  I hope this sire will prove itself to be a great success and bring credit, prestige and additional funds to our country.  There were divided counsels among those who opposed the measure.</P>
      <P>I wonder why the Leader of the Labour Party has not spoken on this industry.  He represents a constituency mainly concerned with this industry but why does he not come in and tell us his view on the matter?  Deputy Dunne has several times said that he was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party.  I take it that Deputy Norton, as the leader of that Party, is <i>au fait</i> and in accord with that Labour Party decision.  I could quite understand a democratic Party making a decision by a majority.  It is quite possible that Deputy Norton may not have been in agreement with it, but democratically he must abide by the majority rule.  I would like to hear him here, one way or another, and would like to see him come in and vote.</P>

      <P>He said he did not know.

Now that he has been told&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will confirm it, as a responsible Minister&mdash;that all the bulls necessary for our cattle requirements can be obtained at any time, that there is no question of a money hold-up in it, now that he is assured of that, will he act up to what he said and vote for the Money Resolution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is proper to reiterate on this Money Resolution our opposition to the proposal to raise this money.  It is not necessary to discuss whether the purchase of Tulyar is a good investment or a bad investment. As I said on the Second Reading, I am prepared to accept the judgment of those in charge of the National Stud that this is a sound investment, but where I oppose the proposal to raise £250,000 by taxation from the people is that it is not the proper way to finance this investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to have Deputies like Deputy Briscoe fooling themselves by a sort of pipe dream, believing that the purchase of Tulyar will add one halfpenny to the general welfare or prosperity of this country. It will not.  It will benefit one small section of the community, those who engage in the bloodstock industry, those who are in that industry because they already have the necessary capital and means to own and breed racehorses. I do not grudge them the benefit they are entitled to expect from the purchase of Tulyar or from the enhanced price of the progeny that will be raised in the next two or three years; but I do question why I and Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Cowan should be asked to put money into the pockets of this particular section.</P>

      <P>I do not query that at all, but I do query very definitely why the general body of our citizens should be asked to make an investment of a substantial kind for one small section.  We cannot cod ourselves, as Deputy Briscoe seems to have done, into a belief that the bloodstock industry is one of our major industries. It is not: it is a very secondary part of agriculture and always will be, unless Deputies like Deputies Briscoe <Col N="2329" /> and Cowan want this country to become again the ranch of the world.</P>

      <P>We are making a substantial capital investment for a secondary branch of our agricultural industry.  We are doing that, I am afraid, without any real effort to defend the investment.  The case for the purchase of Tulyar has been based on the fact that this sire is the best horse in the world.  He well may be, but that is not the way in which we should approach this.  We should rather be concerned to see where the national return will be, what will be the effect on employment, how it will improve the condition of the working people.  If there is a return in that respect, this purchase can be defended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  All of us think occasionally on the wrong lines.  I suggest to the Minister to let the National Stud buy Tulyar if it wants to, but let him not come into the House with a Money Resolution for the purpose.  I make the suggestion to him that I made on Second Reading: let him go back to the bloodstock breeders of the country, the men who are going to make the money, and ask them to pool £250,000.  He would get it overnight. If this sire is the wonderful sire Deputy Briscoe believes him to be&mdash; and apparently is&mdash;could there be any doubt that the bloodstock breeders, now that the National Stud has collared Tulyar, would be only too glad to make the necessary investment to retain him here?  The Minister would be doing a far better day's work for the industry and for the country if he made some effort to organise the industry along lines on which it could finance its own investments.</P>
      <P>It is an unhealthy thing, whatever case may be made for it, to have this kind of luxury investment from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street taking place at a time of general national restriction.  If it could be done otherwise, as I have no doubt it could be, it is a far sounder thing to get the industry itself to pay its way.  It has been done with any number of other industries here already and I do not think it would be impossible for the Minister to make that attempt.  I know that the view I am expressing is a view that is held pretty generally throughout the House and outside, and I certainly think that at least some effort should have been made along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said&mdash;I wonder if he was, in effect, whistling to keep up his courage&mdash;that no one wrote to him protesting against the purchase of Tulyar and that he had seen no evidence of public resentment or criticism.

      <P>I am an individual Deputy and I represent two counties. I travel my constituency very regularly and I should like to give this body of evidence to the Minister and Deputy Briscoe, that it is my experience that there is general and widespread resentment against this proposal&mdash;not, may I hasten to add, that anyone really doubts that the purchase of Tulyar by the National Stud is probably a sound investment.  What the people object to is the call on the general pool to finance the proposal.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be other ways of doing it.  A sum of £250,000 is not chicken-feed.  My imagination is sufficiently flexible to imagine other purpose to which that sum could be put.  It is not proper to discuss them here, but I want to repeat the objection I made on Second Reading with regard to this proposal.  I think it has been a very unfortunate business and a very unfortunate proposal at a time like this.</P>
      <P>It is correct, as Deputy Briscoe said, that the Fine Gael Party has divided views with regard to this matter.  There is no question of concealment in that regard, but, unlike the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party is a democratic political Party, and on matters of this kind we express our own views.</P>

      <P>I am interested, but I just want the House to be a little quiet.  I think that there is a considerable amount of confusion in regard to this very simple matter.  The National Stud is an organisation established by statute.  Its capital was set up by a statute passed by the Oireachtas&mdash;just like the News Agency. It was found that the capital of the company was not sufficient.  This Bill is nothing more or less than a Bill to increase the capital of the company to £500,000.  Obviously, the purpose of that is to enable the National Stud to complete the purchase of Tulyar.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when I was interrupted, there has been a considerable amount of misconception in regard to this.  The Government brought in a Bill to increase the capital of the National Stud.  That matter was before the House on Second Reading.  On that occasion, Deputies from all Parties, with the exception of two, voted in favour of the proposal which is now before the House on the present stage.  It is before the House not just as a Government decision but as the decision of Deputies representing the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Independents, Fine Gael Independents and independent Independents.

I think there would have been agreement to let the Minister have all stages of it the last night but for one Deputy who voted for the Bill and who, for some reason, said that he would not allow that.  He said that the Minister would have to come back another day.  That was a very peculiar attitude for that Deputy to take, but of course any Deputy is entitled to take it.</P>

      <P>This is a company that has been set up by the State.  It has been given public money to develop an essential State industry.  Deputy O'Higgins is perfectly right in his attitude.  He represents the old capitalist system and says this should not be done by the State, that it should be done by private individuals&mdash;by the bloodstock owners.  Deputy O'Higgins is making no fool of himself in this. He can see clearly much farther than his nose, but unfortunately we find the Labour Party being led by Deputy Dunne into this anti-socialist attitude in regard to this measure.</P>

      <P>I regret very sincerely that at no stage has this debate been in its proper perspective.  I want to make a few useful inquiries from the Minister.  If he answers them, he will put this matter at rest once and for all.  This is a provision to increase the capital of the National Stud.  I happen to know a little about the functioning of the National Stud, not, as improperly suggested by a Deputy on this side of the House, having some relationship with breeding, but with having some interest and an inquiring mind where a national venture is concerned and having close personal friendship with certain members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to inform the House what is the real position in the National Stud.  Leaving the issue of Tulyar out of the discussion at the moment, am I right in saying that, so <Col N="2342" /> far as the National Stud is concerned, there has been a very considerable improvement in its assets, thanks to the management and control of it to date? Is not it true to say to this House that some of the purchases made by the National Stud already, on the limited capital that they have been issued, have appreciated in value more than 100 per cent.?  Is not it true to say that an investment by the National Stud in a sire called Royal Charger has already improved the capital position of this company by not less than £75,000 to £80,000?  Is not it also true to say that the progressive, successful breeding policy of the National Stud has enhanced the value of the mares in the possession of the National Stud considerably?  So that, when we are increasing the capital of the National Stud to £500,000, in fact we are increasing the capital of a concern that has already proved itself to be a sound economic venture.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that we came back to the realities of the situation.  Let us analyse the National Stud for what it is.  Deputy O'Higgins put the point of view that the breeders are the people who should make this investment. I do not subscribe to that point of view because I know from experience, having a very deep interest of the bloodstock business and knowing, in a limited way, something about breeding, that, in the case of sires in the possession of people outside the National Stud, the unfortunate small man who may have a very useful mare has not got a hope of getting a nomination&mdash;I am not afraid to say that&mdash;unless it is pay in advance and pay at the maximum price.  In fact, the story is well known in breeding circles that the little man from the County Meath who took a mare to My Prince, and made it the greatest stallion of all time, had his mare locked up by the breeder until he paid the fee.</P>

      <P>I will develop my own argument.  I have it fairly considered. I am making my speech with a certain amount of deliberation.</P>

    <Col N="2343" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get this matter into perspective.  The Minister can be of real service to the country by giving us an idea of what the assets of the National Stud are and by showing, away from this transient discussion of whether Tulyar is the best horse in the world or not, what the functioning of this stud has been.</P>
      <P>I think the functioning of the stud to date has more than justified the decision taken by a previous Dáil that we would have a National Stud.  It is very ill-advised of us, in the light of that experience, to deny to that National Stud the right to carry on on the best possible lines.</P>
      <P>My feeling about Tulyar is the same as it was when I spoke on Second Reading, that, taking the balance of probabilities, with a reasonable amount of luck and with a bit of goodwill on the part of the Irish people, this should prove a new basis for development of bloodstock at home.  If the progeny of Tulyar are as successful as I would wish them to be, there is a basis there for an immense increase in earning potential of the branch of our horse-breeding industry that has not kept pace with the other side of it.  Our jumper and chaser have an unrivalled international reputation.  In the hour before we started this discussion we got evidence of that in a triumph in the Gold Cup for Irish chasers to-day.  Flat breeding in this country has improved extremely over the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>I am so adamant in my support of the purchase of Tulyar because I believe that this gives us an opportunity to go into the two-year-old or three-year-old classes in competition with England, France and America.  It is only when you get into the very high-grade classic breed in this particular stock that you increase your earning potential.  If Tulyar is half as good as I believe he will be, his yearlings for the first, second and third years may in the aggregate be worth anything from £200,000 to £400,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins is equally earnest <Col N="2344" /> in his view and has a right to hold that view.  People may laugh and say that there is no sense in leaving the issue of Tulyar, as we have done on this side of the House, to the individual judgment of each Deputy.  I think we are right.  I am terribly sorry that that is not the general position in the House because I firmly believe that thinking people would not be led astray by sidelines or by the fact that this racehorse is put into a situation in which he should not be. If there were a reasonable approach to this matter, the House would take the view that this is a matter that is worth analysis on its merits.  I want the Minister to put the country's mind at rest.  He can do us a great service.  In increasing the capital of the National Stud to £500,000 we are doing no more and no less than giving the stud better scope for real development.  On the Minister's own statement, there will be a considerable amount, running to £60,000 or £65,000, of capital unexpended after this.  My feeling about the National Stud is that we should not in the first stage have been niggardly about this capital.  Had I been in the House then, I would have been inclined to make the upper ceiling of the capital a good deal higher and to give the directors the right to come, in certain circumstances, to the Minister for a further call up.</P>
    <P>This whole issue, I firmly believe, has never been honestly discussed on its merits.  I think that as a result of good judgment and effort the assets of the National Stud have been so enhanced that, even without Tulyar, the National Stud would not be over-capitalised in its present position at £500,000.  I know what the value of a horse like Royal Charger is and how it has been improved.  I firmly believe that the horses in the National Stud are now making a name for themselves. Let us put Tulyar into that trio, with the same wish for his future, because if you can get that kind of balance in the National Stud, I venture to say that many of the people who may be, in an honest and in a sincere way, opposed to this particular venture may feel very pale and wan in the light of the achievement that could be brought about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2345" /> There are two points of view.  My point of view is that we are at least creating a potentiality for a tremendous development of the best two-year-old and three-year-old type of horses in Ireland.  I feel that if Tulyar is a success it will not be an infrequent but a general achievement of Irish breeders to be able to compete in the English Derby and in the English and French classic races.  We will not have the position that only with a breeder of immense wealth will there be the possibility of a Derby winner.  I believe that on the basis of this new change in strain and line of breeding in the National Stud we may find that the small men will get an opportunity, not only of breeding, but perhaps of owning and training the very best type of classic horse which may be the progeny of Tulyar.  I will have no hesitation in answering to the people of West Cork whom I represent for my views on this matter&mdash;I know that they are oppressed by many problems and that there are difficulties created for them by the failure of the Government economic policy&mdash;in saying that I would be doing very poor service to them as their representative if I allowed my appreciation of their many sufferings to dull my judgment as to what might be something of real national value, as I believe it will be.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister could indicate to the House what the real assets of the National Stud are, what the improvement of the general situation in the National Stud has been, thanks to the prudent management, control and development of the stud.  In the light of that and of the enhanced value of the effort already made by the National Stud, I think the House would take a more reasoned view of it.  As I said, I do not think the debate has been brought to the proper level.  I do not think it is too much to ask this House to allow the National Stud to have a capital of £500,000.  In fact, if Tulyar was not in the picture and if the Minister had come, in a general way, to ask for a substantial increase in the capital of the National Stud to enable improvements to be carried out in buildings, to allow of the purchase of a group of mares or the acquisition of more land, and painted a different <Col N="2346" /> picture from the one which was a little bit distorted out of perspective by the fact that one horse cost so much and one of the richest men in the world was to get the biggest price ever for a horse, I think the House would be very slow to question the wisdom of such an investment in the National Stud.  I do not question it.</P>
    <P>Let people say what they will about sudden storms arising in regard to the position of the National Stud.  I think there is such an inherent sportsmanship in the ordinary Irishman that he will wish good luck to this effort of the National Stud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's view has been put fairly well and fairly honestly by the speakers on the Second Reading.  We indicated that as a Party we had nothing to say against the National Stud as such; that we had nothing to say against the purchase of Tulyar on the merits of the horse or that we did not wish either the National Stud or Tulyar any particular harm.  But we did point out that there was a certain amount of risk in paying such a price at such a time.  We contrasted the spending of this £250,000 with the present unemployment and heavy taxation in a country which the Taoiseach claimed was groaning under heavy taxation.  I think that was not unfair.  I think that Deputies like Deputy Briscoe should not take us to task for doing that, if it is our honest opinion.  I would not have spoken but for the fact that I want to repudiate the suggestion made by Deputy Briscoe that, because we cannot produce letters or telegrams protesting against the purchase of Tulyar, we are unable to interpret the wishes of our constituents.  It may be correct that he has got letters or telegrams. I certainly have got no letters or telegrams, but I am still satisfied that the ordinary people in my constituency whom I represent and who voted for me do not agree with the giving of this £250,000 to the National Stud at such a time as this.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not express that view and vote according to what I believe is the attitude of the people I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the attempt to pour abuse <Col N="2347" /> on Deputy Dunne, as I deplored the attempt to pour abuse on Deputy Briscoe by people on this side some time in the past.  I do not agree with personalities.  As for the contribution made by Deputy Cowan, when he used this Bill to have a crack at his former colleagues in Clann na Poblachta and his former colleagues in the Labour Party, I think it was deplorable and that this House should not be treated to such things as that.  It is not so very long ago since Deputy Cowan's new friends were claiming that he was in receipt of Moscow gold.</P>

That suggestion has the same value as the suggestion that the Deputy was in receipt of Moscow gold.  As a Party, we are not arguing the merits of the National Stud or the merits of Tulyar.  We are protesting that this is not the time to spend £250,000 to increase the capital of the National Stud while there are people in want.</P>

Lest there be any misunderstanding I want to repeat them now.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Second Reading I indicated that I regarded it as an act of public indecency to tell the State employees, on the one hand, that there was no money available to meet an award made in their favour by an agreed arbitration tribunal and, on the other hand, to come to the House with a proposal to spend £250,000 on the purchase of a racehorse.  In my view that is a matter which is not capable of being understood by any section of the public.</P>

The Minister will remember that on the last occasion on which I spoke he had a long discussion with me as to whether they were right or wrong in entering into something that is a gamble and he quite fairly admitted, and I think this must be admitted by anybody who considers the position, that the purchase of this racehorse was a sheer gamble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit I had no intention of speaking on the subject.  I was brought to my feet by reason of the fact that Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Cowan both devoted a large portion of the statements they had to make to what I was alleged to have said or not said last week.  I am surely entitled to reply to that.</P>
      <P>The Minister a few minutes ago sought to deny that this money was being sought for the purchase of a racehorse.  I would refer him to his own statement at column 1603, Volume 136, of the Dáil Debates of 25th February, 1953, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The enactment of this Bill is now urgently necessary, following on the recent acquisition by the company of a very valuable horse named Tulyar.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide £250,000.  The price of the horse, I understand, is £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I hope they will be circulated far and wide.  Another Deputy talked at length on the prestige that the purchase of this racehorse would bring to Ireland.  I think that the purchase of this horse by a <Col N="2353" /> State which boasts of higher unemployment, higher emigration than any other country in Europe, that boasts of 90,000 unemployed will bring very little prestige to the country.  The expenditure of £250,000 on work that would relieve some of the unemployment might bring prestige to the Government.  Public opinion outside this country would find it very hard to understand how this Government that claims to be bankrupt, that claims to be unable to pay its servants, that claims to be unable to provide employment, to provide money for public works, can afford to spend £250,000 on a racehorse which is described by the Minister himself as a gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Government and the other speakers who supported this Resolution appear to misconceive the arguments and the reasons why others oppose it.  Speaking for myself, I do not oppose this Resolution on the grounds that Tulyar is a bad horse, on the grounds that the National Stud is not being properly managed or on the grounds that it may possibly prove a bad investment.  My sole objection to this Resolution being passed by the House is that at this particular time we cannot afford it.  That is my only reason.  I am not going to criticise the merits or the demerits of the horse and despite what the Minister may now say the money is being provided, and the Minister has told us so, for the purchase of this horse Tulyar.</P>
      <P>At the risk of being pulled up by the Chair I will give my reasons why we cannot afford to pass this Resolution at the moment.  Were I to quote at length, nothing could speak better against the Resolution than the speeches delivered by the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste over the past 18 months.  During all that time they have been telling us we are expending too much, be it on capital investment or otherwise.  They have also been telling us they cannot afford various necessities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, Sir, I am giving my reasons why I am voting against this Money Resolution.  We cannot afford it in our present economic position.  I am advancing arguments as to why we cannot afford it.  We have been told by Deputy Briscoe that he has heard no outcry against the expenditure of this money.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to quote any particular paper, but I am sure most Deputies in this House have hear of a paper called the <i>Irish Catholic.</i>  It was quoted from at length here by some of the Deputies on the Labour Benches.</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Catholic</i> is a paper which is widely read.  It is the mouthpiece of a considerable number of the people of this State and it gives reasons why we should not spend this money now on the purchase of a racehorse.  Deputy Captain Cowan has told us that this Bill was passed by a majority of all Parties in the House.  I am practically three and a half years in this House, a short time, I admit, but I have never known Fianna Fáil to split and divide on any Bill.  The Whip is always on.</P>

      <P>When the National Stud was set up in this country, it became the property of the Irish people and the capital at that time was fixed at £250,000.  From all sides of the House the then Minister for Agriculture&mdash; now the Minister for Health&mdash;was lauded as doing the right thing in acquiring the Tully Stud in County Kildare, Deputy Norton's constituency, for the nation.</P>

    <P>As I say the capital at that time was fixed at £250,000.  To my mind we have heard the greatest nonsense ever uttered in regard to the purchase of this horse.  We hear a lot of talk about the unemployed and their poverty and it is suggested that this money might be divided in pence and halfpennies to be given to the unemployed.  Every Irishman, poor or rich, has always been proud of the fact that this country was able to produce horses which brought honour to the nation, whether these horses were included in the Army jumping team, were winners of the Grand National or were Irish horses like the <Col N="2357" /> animal, ridden by an Irishman, which won the Cheltenham Gold Cup to-day beating the cream of England and France.

      <P>I am sure that on some future occasion we shall also see Deputy Dunne leading the workers of County Dublin to welcome the winners of big races abroad, horses of world renown.  We are here considering a proposal of the Minister to increase the capital of the National Stud and the suggestion is put forward that this money is being taken out of taxation. Well the persons who made that suggestion know that it is not being taken out of taxation.  The directors of the National Stud are being authorised to increase their capital by this amount; it will cost the Exchequer nothing, though I am subject to correction on that.  It is not a charge on the Exchequer.  The interest and the sinking fund on that money will come out of National Stud money.</P>

I am sure there is no objection to that.  That is the reason why Deputy Norton did not <Col N="2358" /> come in here, like his colleagues in the Party, to object to this Money Resolution. He remained carefully away from the House during the discussion of the Bill.  With Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Harris he has a big share in this concern.

I know where we got the money when we had the stable boys out on strike 25 or 30 years ago. I know where the money came from. That is why I never backed a horse. Deputy Briscoe asked whether we could produce letters or telegrams.  I cannot, but owing to the pending by-election in the County Wicklow in my own constituency&mdash;I regret the circumstances which rendered this necessary &mdash;I met men, even supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, who were very loud in their protest against the spending of such a huge amount of money at a time when the Minister for Finance alleges that we are practically a bankrupt nation.  Deputy Briscoe is very popular in Bray, and I am sure he will have an opportunity in the very near future of meeting some of the 800 or 900 men who are unfortunately compelled to sign at the labour exchange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain our position to Deputy Cowan who said that the Labour Party should have regarded this as one of the schemes of socialism which the State should take over and that the State should pay and then put up with the losses.  If a good proposition was put up to the Labour Party to control various national concerns, we would probably have no objection, but when we are asked to spend £250,000 in this manner, we say that better use could be made of that sum by utilising it to reduce the burdens placed on the people at the present time, burdens which the Taoiseach says are practically impossible to bear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan made great play in regard to the support that the public should give.  I am not making any accusation against any Deputy as to which way he should vote.  Every Deputy is entitled to vote according to his conscience.  I do say, however, that if some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies were given a free hand they would probably go into the Lobby with me to-night.  Deputy Briscoe is probably consistent and honest in speaking out his mind as to what he believes is right.  As we recognise his right, surely our rights should be recognised without accusations being made.  If we are opposed to the expenditure of this money at the present time, it is because we believe that greater use could be made of it and better benefits provided for the people of Ireland by utilising it in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has any doubts about it, he can postpone the matter until the result of the by-election in Wicklow <Col N="2361" /> is known.  Telegrams or letters will not be required then and I am certain that even supporters of Fianna Fáil will vote against the expenditure of this money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Money Resolution asking the House to vote money for the National Stud.  I cannot see that anything that the Deputy says bears any reference whatever to the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose it and I believe I am interpreting the wishes of my constituents by opposing the huge waste of money and the burdens which were placed on the people by the Budget.  I suggest that the people are being betrayed at the present time by a minority Government which has no mandate whatever to put this charge on the people of the country.  For that reason, I believe I am interpreting not only the wishes of the people at the present time but also visualising the results of the by-election.  I am interpreting the wishes of the majority of the people who, when given an opportunity, will vote in no uncertain manner and show that I am expressing their views to-night when they place the candidate at the bottom of the poll.</P>

      <P>I understand that the purpose of this Resolution is to provide additional money to enlarge the capital of the National Stud proper.  I think that at a time when the efforts of the people who have the interests of this country at heart are directed towards promoting every national enterprise that is designed to increase the income of the nation, to provide additional employment and to enlarge our exports, we should be unanimous in supporting a proposal of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the fact that so many leading members of the Opposition Parties came into the House to support this proposal.  I think it is a desirable thing that men who are elected to the Dáil on popular franchise should be big enough to place narrow Party interests aside and view a question of this kind from the long-term national interest.  If there was ever a question of long-term national <Col N="2362" /> interest involved in any issue that arose in this House it would be in respect of the enlargement of the capital of this company.  Any Deputy can come into this House and seek to make political capital out of the expenditure that was incurred by the National Stud Company on the purchase of a horse recently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say this.  I am not an expert on horse-breeding.  I do not claim to be as singularly abstentionist in regard to races as Deputy Everett.  I have now and then put a shilling on a horse and I have just now and then attended race meetings.  I do not claim to be an expert on horseracing, but I have heard men who can speak with some authority on this matter express their view in favour of this purchase.  I listened attentively to Deputies Dillon, Cosgrave and Collins on this subject and I found that they have absolute confidence that the horse recently purchased by the National Stud Company is a first-class animal, and that, with luck, it ought to produce a profit for the National Stud Company and for the horse-breeding industry generally.  That is all that one can say.</P>
      <P>Every enterprise of this kind carries with it an element of risk.  If you put money into the development of a factory in the County Wicklow, the County Kildare or anywhere else, you may lose your money and you may not make any great profit, but at least you are entering upon an enterprise which you have reasonable ground for hoping will bring profit to the company and the nation.  That is all that can be said in regard to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have listened to a lot of nauseatingly dishonest criticism of this proposal.  I think there are people who know perfectly well that the Minister and the National Stud Company are endeavouring to do what they think is best for the horse-breeding industry and for the nation, but because some Deputies think there are some political kudos to be obtained <Col N="2363" /> by opposing this project they come into the House to oppose it aggressively.</P>
    <P>I think we have got to face this question realistically.  There is no question whatever of taking money out of the State revenues to finance the purchase of this particular horse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean tax revenue. There is no question of taking money out of tax revenue.  There is a question of providing an investment out of borrowed money.  If the State raises money for national development, they are as much entitled to put some of it into the development of the National Stud as they are to put it into a hydroelectric scheme or a turf development scheme, or any scheme designed to give employment and increase the output of the nation.  Increased exports ought to be regarded as beneficial and on that ground we must support this proposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a very unworthy suggestion, that the Government could not find money to provide a bull for Donegal.  We all know there never has been any difficulty about providing money for the purchase of bulls for any county.  An objection to providing a certain breed in a certain district will frequently arise on grounds that may be wise or otherwise but are considered by the Department to be wise.</P>
      <P>There is no point in raising these frivolous objections to the enlargement of the capital of a company which is spending over £10,000 in wages each year and which is assisting in a far-reaching way the improvement of one particular branch of our national activities. There is no truth in the suggestion that the investment of this money will deprive some other industry or enterprise of the capital it requires. We have shown last year that it is possible to raise within the country whatever capital the State requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as that is so, we can raise <Col N="2364" /> any capital needed for any industry or economic enterprise that may need State assistance.  It would be well for Deputies of the Opposition not to advertise so loudly and so vehemently the division in their ranks on this important proposition.  If they are honest and honourable men, they will give fair consideration, not perhaps to the points put by the Minister but at least to those put by the former Minister for Agriculture, by Deputy Collins and Deputy Cosgrave.  Those men have studied the case in a reasonable way and they should be entitled to expect that members of their own Party and of Parties associated with them here would give them a fair and reasonable hearing.</P>

      <P>It was also unworthy of some Deputies to say that because a certain sum is being provided to finance this company there will not be enough to finance other State expenditure such as social services and the relief of unemployment. I suppose that was an irrelevant suggestion but even if it were relevant it should not have been made.  We can raise from the resources of this nation all the money we require for works of national development.</P>
      <P>I want to stress what was said by Deputy MacBride as on this point I would rather agree with him:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In circumstances where the country was looking for an outlet for investment, then by all means there might be a case to be made for the investment in this racehorse.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is from the Official Report for the 25th February, column 1653.  Deputy MacBride said that if we were looking for something in which to invest money <Col N="2365" /> profitably, then we would support this project.  That is exactly the position: we are looking for enterprises in which to invest money profitably.  Anyone who studies economics or the development of industry must realise how hard it is to find a suitable project here in which to invest money with any reasonable hope of remuneration.</P>

That is the kind of investment we are looking for, as Deputy MacBride said, and that is the kind we have found and for which we are seeking to provide money in this Resolution.</P>
      <P>Since the purpose of this Irish National Stud is to ensure that the benefits of the first class breeding stock are distributed widely amongst breeders of horses throughout the country, I would suggest to the Minister that special consideration be given to the small breeder, to farmers who are owners of first-class mares.  I think that is one of the fundamental purposes of this National Stud and one that ought to be fulfilled, that farmers or other small breeders who own first-class mares should be allowed to derive benefit from this investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be able to present a particular report for Deputy Briscoe's benefit. He told us that, so far as his constituency was concerned&mdash;he represents a working-class populace&mdash;the move by <Col N="2366" /> the National Stud to purchase the racehorse Tulyar was a most popular move indeed.  On the other hand, he said that members of the Labour Party and those who voted against this Bill were merely making an effort to grab a few odd votes.  That contention was also made by Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan.  If the proposal is so popular as Deputy Briscoe would have us believe, we are merely trying to lose ourselves votes.  The picture which Deputy Briscoe would like me to paint is this: last weekend, as I went through Wexford town, practically every unemployed man I met abused me for voting against this Bill, a Bill to advance £250,000 for the purchase of the racehorse Tulyar; every housewife I met said that the Government should be congratulated for advancing the sum of money to the National Stud for the purchase of this horse; and at every branch meeting I attended, there was a motion of censure on me for attempting to vote against this wonderful capital investment. That is the type of picture Deputy Briscoe would have me present, but I am afraid it is not the picture I can present.</P>
      <P>I wonder how far intolerance can be brought.  It seems like a sacrilege now, after listening to Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan, to oppose anything brought in by this Government.  I would be prepared to subject myself to a by-election or a general election on the issue of Tulyar alone, funny as it may be to some of the Deputies on the Government Benches.  If it is unpopular for me to denounce the purchase of Tulyar, I am prepared to face the consequences, at least so far as my constituents are concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan would try to teach us Socialism and try to give us a policy of nationalisation for this country.  He says it is surely against the principles and policy of the Labour Party to vote against a Bill which is a 100 per cent. Socialist measure.  If I were ever to be as full-blooded a Socialist as <Col N="2367" /> Deputy Cowan, I should imagine that measures of nationalisation of which he spoke would be intended for the greater good of the greater number of the community and I do not believe, as Deputy O'Higgins said he did not believe&mdash;irrespective of his Party affiliations or mine&mdash;that this measure of nationalisation is for the public good, for the greater good of the greater number of the community, at present and in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>It would be ridiculous for me to refute some of the comic relief allegations made by Deputy Cowan.  These have been fairly frequent from Deputy Cowan over the past few months.  He provides the comic relief in the course of discussions embarrassing for the members of the Government.  There is no sinister campaign against the purchase of Tulyar.  Surely he speaks with his tongue in his cheek; surely he does not speak with conviction, when he alleges against any member of the Labour Party who has spoken that we would ally ourselves with any British influences who would be jealous of the purchase of Tulyar in an attempt to stop the purchase or to stop the National Stud from owning the horse.</P>
      <P>I should like to say why I am opposed to this Money Resolution.  I am not in favour of this House giving permission to the Government to provide any moneys from the Central Fund for the purpose of operating this measure.  My reason is this, that I believe this Government cannot afford to advance £250,000 to the National Stud for the purchase of Tulyar when they will not advance the same amount of money for the relief of unemployment. I believe this country cannot afford £250,000 on such a luxury investment when the country is in the state it is in, a situation in which there are approximately 600 less than 90,000 people unemployed.  I do not believe that my vote should go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Money Resolution is to authorise the Government to pay from the Central Fund and the growing produce thereof the amount necessary to carry this Bill into effect. When I heard it said during the debate that this would put no expense on the Exchequer I was rather astounded because if that were the position there would be no necessity for this Money Resolution.  I should like to approach this matter in a reasonable way and see whether it is wise to spend this sum of money in this way.  The proposal, of course, is twofold.  The one certainty is, no matter what the Minister may say to the contrary, that it is going to increase the revenue of the Aga Khan by £250,000.  What it is going to bring to the people of this country I am not sure.</P>
      <P>Those who know anything about sire horses are aware that, for the first two or three years, the earnings of an animal with Tulyar's reputation are going to be fairly substantial.  I think there can be no doubt that as regards his first lot of two and three-year olds full earnings will be secured.  The Minister estimates that the income may be as high as £20,000 per annum.  I have no doubt in view of Tulyar's reputation, that this sum will be easily realised. especially when we take into account his performances, plus the value of his progeny.  Therefore, I think the Minister's estimate of between £16,000 and £20,000 is well-founded.  There is, I think, the certainty that the income for the first three years will amount to £60,000.  A question will then arise as to the performances of his progeny.  If they are good, then everything is going to be right, and the money has been well spent.  It is, however, a gamble to that extent.</P>
      <P>In trying to approach this matter in a reasonable way, I put this question to myself: suppose the Irish National Stud did not buy Tulyar, that he was sold elsewhere, let us suppose, to the United States or to Britain, and that this country, therefore, did not have the opportunity of having his service, I wonder what criticism would be made of the Tully Stud? Would people say: &ldquo;why did you not buy the horse; why did the National Stud let a good horse like that leave the country?&rdquo; I do not think anybody has faced up to the matter from that angle.  This is a time when there is financial stringency in other directions.  I do not want to get suspended, and if I do transgress I hope to obey the ruling of the Chair. But I will say this: at a time when the Government feels that money can only be procured at 5 per cent. for all the things that it is necessary to get done it is an astounding fact that they can throw this vast sum into this kitty for the purpose of buying this horse, notwithstanding the Minister's contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not help his case <Col N="2375" /> when he interjected that the sum of £250,000 was not for the purchase of Tulyar but to extend the capital of the company.  I want to point out that the Minister was not fair to himself.  It is true that he covered himself subsequently. He asserted, as reported at column 1603 of the Dáil Debates, 25th February, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The enactment of this Bill is now urgently necessary following on the recent acquisition of the company of a very valuable horse named Tulyar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He does say that the directors have been searching for a suitable sire.</P>

      <P>I want to know from the Minister if he is satisfied that Tulyar is as good as he is said to be.  I want to know if he and the directors of the National Stud have fully examined in every way the whole question of his performance.  In horse racing and in dog racing reputations have been made that were not justified. His Excellency the Aga Khan can do a lot of things.  I am not too happy that, if it was somebody owning a smaller stable who had Tulyar, he would have met with the same success. These are problems that I am sure the Minister and the company have taken into consideration.  I am in favour of the purchase of Tulyar because I think we could not afford to lose him in case he is as good as he is expected to be.</P>

      <P>I have listened to my colleague from Wexford, Deputy Allen, trying to involve the leader of the Labour Party in the National Stud and being allowed to get away with it by the Chair.  We, on this side of the House, who represent the same people, ought to be allowed to develop our case and to explain why we are objecting to the purchase of this horse.  The horse may be all right but the price to the Irish people is all wrong considering the present position in the country.</P>
      <P>We believe that the main business of the Government to-day is to provide money for the employment of the 80,000 people and more who are unemployed. We believe that a subsidy should have been given for butter to save the poor people throughout the country.  What did the Minister say in his own area to an old age pensioner who only got a 1/6 increase to meet the cost of living? How will he go down to Kilkenny and meet these people who will say to him &ldquo;Where did you get the money for the Aga Khan?&rdquo; Why did not the Minister come into this House before this purchase was made and tell the House and the country about this purchase? The Minister must have some control over the National Stud.  This House must provide the money for that company and the Government and Minister must take responsibility.</P>
      <P>We hear all about this great horse. He ran two seasons.  The English, who are a great racing people, and the French, who are richer than we are, did not even look at the horse.</P>

      <P>It is very easy for the Minister to say that the Americans would have given more.  That is the old story of the dealer.  Any man who <Col N="2378" /> is selling a pony will say: &ldquo;If I go to Jack Murphy I will get £10 more.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In speeches made since the Budget was introduced we have been told that the inter-Party Government broke the country, that they left no dollars behind them.  Now Deputy Cogan tells us about all the employment that will be given by the purchase of this racehorse. In certain stables during the flat racing season a few hundred men are brought in, but when the season is over these men are unemployed. Not so long ago the Irish Transport Union made a demand on the racehorse trainers for an increase for stable boys, and it was only when strike action was threatened that they consented to meet their employees.  In the daily papers last week I saw the names of a lot of people.  Of these I only knew one who is a County Wexford man and is a breeder.  I come from a county in which winners of the Grand National were bred.  But I know small farmers in my constituency who have thoroughbred mares and who will never be able to bring them to the National Stud because the fee will be too high.  It is only the man with money who will get any benefit from the purchase of this racehorse.</P>
      <P>In my town at present there are 400 people unemployed.  Over 200 road workers and quarry workers were dismissed because there was no money to pay them.  At the same time, we are giving £250,000 for this horse, plus insurance and expenses.  Have the Government gone mad?  We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce about a month ago that we were to have a transatlantic air service for which pilots would be provided and that it would cost this country nothing.  We did not believe that of course.  Some Deputies evidently think that we are to get a present of this racehorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this expenditure is taking place in a country which is overtaxed and which has a very high cost of living. The Minister for Agriculture told this House and some county committees of agriculture that he was paying the highest price for wheat.  That may be true, but we are paying a higher price <Col N="2379" /> for bread and butter.  As long as there are unemployed people in this country the first duty of any Government which is in office, whether it is the Coalition Government or the Fianna Fáil Government, is to provide employment and to house and clothe the people.  That is their duty and they should not be gambling in racehorses.  I suppose the next thing the Government will go into is the purchase of dogs, that they will be buying a stud dog.</P>

      <P>Yes, I think the Fianna Fáil Party has gone to the dogs.  They are forgetting the plain people of the country.  They should remember that it was the Labour Party and the plain people of the country that put Fianna Fáil into power for the first time.  We have been listening to Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Allen and Deputy Cowan sneering. Some time ago Deputy Cowan was running around the City of Dublin saying: &ldquo;Join the volunteers; march on the North.&rdquo; The ex-Minister for Justice wanted the Government to lock the Deputy up because he was forming an army.  Last night the Deputy said the war clouds were passing.  I suppose his army has been demobbed.</P>

      <P>It is strange how people can change.  We will see some of the Independent Deputies walking into the Division Lobby to-night to support this.  Deputy Dr. Browne, who a few years ago clamoured so much for the poor people, I suppose will walk into the Lobby to-night and vote for this expenditure of £250,000, while the people of Dublin whom he and Deputy Cowan represent will have to buy margarine in future because they are not able to buy butter.  I should like to see the four Independent Deputies who are supporting the Government join the Fianna Fáil Party and not be serving under two flags as Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years Deputy Cogan has been wailing about the price of milk and the necessity for milk costings.  What has <Col N="2380" /> he done since?  When the farmers took strike action and forced the Minister for Agriculture to meet them Deputy Cogan said very little against the Government at a time when the people of Dublin were getting powdered milk. For the first time, we had powdered milk served in Leinster House.  The Government were prepared to let the people of Dublin and people in the country, who could not get fresh milk, give powdered milk to their children.</P>
    <P>When he was Minister for Health. Deputy Dr. Browne was all out for the provision of good milk, pure milk and pasteurised, but he never raised his voice in this House in protest against the Government's action at that time. When the Government arrested farmers and put them in Mountjoy Jail, Deputy Cogan never uttered one word of protest.  Now he is all-out for the National Stud.  I think that the dairying industry is more important than this great horse they are talking about because the children must be provided with milk.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell said, the Government could not get money for a bull, but they can get it for the Aga Khan, the richest man in the world.  They state that he would prefer to give the Irish people a chance of purchasing this great horse.  Why not bring the horse over to the Aga Khan's stables and put him there at the disposal of the Irish farmer? Why would the Minister not give a subsidy to the small farmers so that they could take their mares to this horse?  How otherwise can the small farmer or the small breeder get any advantage?  He will get, as things are, no advantage but he will have to pay his rates and his taxes just the same.  It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back, and this is the last straw as far as taxation here is concerned.</P>
    <P>Not one of the men sitting behind the Minister got a mandate from the people to squander money.  A few weeks ago we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce wanting £1,500,000 for C.I.E.  Yesterday we had a Supplementary Estimate for the Army and the Minister said they were going to buy armaments from foreign <Col N="2381" /> countries and one of those countries is England.  In the years gone by we heard about the people who whacked John Bull and all the rest of it.  We heard a Minister say on one occasion that he did not care if all the ships were at the bottom of the sea.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said: &ldquo;Burn everything British except coal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What a change of front now! Of course, the Government will stay there so long as they have the support of those people who were elected in their constituencies on the inter-Party vote and the Government may last for three and a half years.  Mark my words. After three and a half years the members of the front benches will have pensions.  The Parliamentary Secretaries will have pensions.</P>

      <P>The ordinary T.D. does more than any Minister.  He has to write letters and call to Departments. The Minister has a whole lot of civil servants to do the work for him.  He gets a pension after three years.  Is that not a fact?  Speeches were made in my constituency by members of the present Government.  I did not listen to them but I read them in the local papers.  Their programme was full employment; put out the inter-Party Government; they are ruining the country.  What do we find to-day? According to the official figures on the 14th February of this year there were 88,095 people unemployed.  Is that a good record for a Government over 18 months in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery purchased under Marshall Aid to reclaim the land is <Col N="2382" /> now being put into the hands of contractors. In my constituency, as Deputy Allen knows, work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act has almost ceased.  The men are emigrating from the rural areas every week.  The Rosslare boat is full of young men and women.  The Taoiseach said that it was not employment alone that was the cause of emigration; he said there were other attractions.  Does the Taoiseach really mean that?  He said in Galway that they were slaving, living in dirty houses and all the rest of it.  Has he forgotten that he made that statement?</P>
    <P>We know that in England to-day the food situation is very bad.  The Irish people are working as navvies or in the mines.  I know that from people who have come back.  I know that from friends to whom we have to send a parcel of meat.  Then we have the Taoiseach telling us that it is not unemployment which is causing the people to leave.  They are going to England to see the attractions.  I want to nail that lie now, for it is a lie. There is no attraction for the Irish worker in England.  The young men, after two years, are conscripted, and no effort is made here to protect them. There are hundreds of young men to-night in Korea who were conscripted into the British Army.  The Irish Government should protect the Irish workers who have to leave the country through no fault of their own, but through the fault of the Government in power.  I was in England and Scotland in my time.  It is a shame for an Irish Government to be boasting about this great horse, boasting about the great animal they are getting when at the same time they do nothing to stop emigration.</P>
    <P>Housing schemes have slowed up. Work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act has slowed up.  The Estimate for the Forestry Division has been cut by £250,000.  Would it not be better to give this £250,000 that we are discussing here to forestry in order to keep the workers in employment? We have a National Stud.  Of course, everything is national but the National Stud is run by foreigners. There is nothing national about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that has come out anyhow.  These people are appointed by the Government and with the sanction of the Minister although he said a short time ago that he has no control over this establishment.  Where are we now?  What kind of confused statements are those?  At one moment the Minister has no function and now, in answer to Deputy Lehane, he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I think this House should have control over everything for which it votes money.  We would be failing in our duty to the people we represent if we in the Labour Benches did not make a strong protest in this connection. Of course, Fianna Fáil is not interested in the ordinary working men because the majority of its members are drawn from amongst, doctors, solicitors and farmers.  They do not care about the worker and they are playing up to the capitalist element in the community. They would like more emigration to England or Scotland so that when the next general election or the by-election in Wicklow comes along, the workers will be gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government were <Col N="2384" /> very anxious to get back into power, but how they induced the four Independent Deputies to vote for them I do not know.  At the time the Government was being formed I was in hospital and that morning the <i>Irish Press</i> was on the Taoiseach's table.  He looked at it and said to his housekeeper: &ldquo;Take it away and get me four Independents.&rdquo;  On the front page of <i>Dublin Opinion</i> this month you will see a drawing of Tulyar lying against a post and also one of John Citizen.  This horse has been discussed so much in this House that he is nearly spurred to death, and when the progeny of this animal are two and three years old and are racing in the Phoenix Park or elsewhere everyone in the country will back them.  It will be a good advertisement for the tipsters.</P>
    <P>We are against this Money Resolution. The Minister should have come to the House and told us what had really taken place.  I saw this whole matter published in the English papers three weeks before I heard it here, when the Aga Khan announced the sale of Tulyar.  The Irish people knew nothing about it.  It is only now when the Minister is looking for the money to pay for it that he approaches the House.  Everyone in my constituency is shocked at the idea and at the state of affairs in which thousands are unemployed in every little town in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would say that no matter what attacks have been made on us from the far side of the House by Deputy Briscoe and other Deputies it is our duty to fight against this.  We represent the plain people.  We are sorry to see so many of our comrades leaving the country and signing the register.  It is a shame that the Fianna Fáil Government, after all they said, have money now to give to the Aga Khan as a gift.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of covering the ground that has been covered by previous speakers.  I appreciate that one is confined to the motion before the House and I recognise the ruling of the Chair.  Now that the Government have insisted upon the purchase of this well-known racehorse, they are faced with the position that they must provide accommodation for him.  It is from that point of view that I would examine this Financial Resolution.</P>
      <P>I was not available to speak on the pros and cons of the advisability of expending £250,000 for the purchase of this racehorse.  While I appreciate that the Government, perhaps, could make a reasonable case for their conduct and that the purchase of this animal may be an asset to the State, I feel I have a duty to perform, and that is to point out that at a time like this it was an ill-advised step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should have examined this whole situation more carefully and have waited for a more reasonable opportunity than now, when the country is faced with unemployment. At this juncture it is not opportune to spend £250,000 on the purchase of a horse and £250,000 for the reconstruction or renovation of the stud in Kildare.  If things were normal I would have no hesitation in walking into the Lobby to support the principle involved, and I am sure most Deputies feel the same.  We have a good name with regard to bloodstock. We would wish to uphold that name, and I recognise that the Department of Agriculture is anxious to uphold our <Col N="2387" /> reputation for bloodstock which has been established over a period of years.  I do not think, however, that failure to purchase this animal or failure to provide £250,000 for the re-organisation and reconstruction of the stud in Kildare would injure our name for the time being.</P>
    <P>We notice that over the past few months unemployment has been increasing at the rate of 1,000 per week. That in itself should have been sufficient to deter the Government from spending money on this particular project.  No matter what protests or suggestions may be made by Deputies the Government have now gone half the way and they must go the other half. There is no use purchasing this animal if reasonable accommodation is not provided for him.  There is no use in throwing away £250,000 for the sake of another £250,000.  I suppose they must go to the full limit, but I doubt if any Deputy, either on the Government side or this side, can in honesty justify the expenditure of this sum. Admittedly, it is only £500,000 or thereabouts, and it may seem small when we remember that in a few short hours some days ago we passed Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £10,000,000.  This may seem a small sum in comparison with that total, but nevertheless, it is a sum that, if spent in certain counties in the West, would bring considerable relief.</P>
    <P>I believe, as an ordinary Deputy from a rural constituency, that if I were Minister for Agriculture I would be unable to justify my conduct in sponsoring expenditure of this kind. Neither would I be able to justify the conduct of my Party in sponsoring a project entailing an expenditure of almost £500,000 at a time when there is so much unemployment and the cost of living has increased so substantially. Our opposition to this Resolution is not due to any desire to injure bloodstock breeders but to the feeling that the Government did not give the matter the consideration it should have received before presenting the Money Resolution to this House.  I am bound to oppose the Resolution on that ground and for no other reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I think the best attitude to adopt in this matter is to oppose the expenditure of this money.  It is good politics but I do not think it is sound common-sense. I think that those who are opposing the spending of this money are acting very inconsistently because we have heard a great deal about repatriation of assets and the fact that we have a considerable amount of money invested in England from which we are getting a very small dividend.  I would prefer to get rid of some of these assets that are paying such a small dividend and to have in this country a horse such as Tulyar that will help a most important industry, the horse-breeding industry, which at the moment is worth a considerable amount to this country and which in future will be worth considerably more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It is a capital investment and a capital investment must be paid for by the proceeds of the sale of some of the capital investments we already have in England which are giving very low returns in dividends.  I am perfectly satisfied that it is worth while taking this chance. It is a chance, because anybody dealing with live stock in any section knows that there is always a chance involved in such dealings.  As far as we know this is one of the best horses in the world.  Horses that are bred in Ireland are amongst the best horses in the world and I think that having regard to the importance of the horse-breeding industry to the economy of the country, to the extent to which it has been developed, we should forget any cheap political advantages that might accrue from voting against this proposal, take our courage in our hands and as responsible people do what we believe is best in the interests of the country. Knowing that it is an unpopular thing to do and that it is a thing that will be used against every Deputy at election time, but believing it is the right thing to do, I am giving the Resolution all the support I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>He said to me: &ldquo;Is it not a shocking thing to spend £250,000 on this horse and send it out of the country, making a gift of it to the Aga Khan?&rdquo; Half of it goes to the Aga Khan, of course.  We understand his Royal Highness is a friend of the generalissimo.  We are sending this money to the poverty-stricken family of the Khans, some of whom reside in America and have a claim on this money, as well as those who reside in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his remarks the old man said to me: &ldquo;Is it not a remarkable thing that the best horse that this country ever had was produced by a dam which cost a few hundred guineas and a sire which cost at the most a couple of thousand pounds? We are sending £250,000 out of the country and taking a gamble on this horse.&rdquo; I asked him: &ldquo;To what great horse are you referring?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Tulyar.&rdquo;  His point was that if it was possible for the bloodstock people here to produce Tulyar at a cost of 2,000 guineas or 3,000 guineas at the outside, surely that was not the line of country that the bloodstock industry should pursue and explore in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good case was made I think by Deputy O'Donnell in reference to <Col N="2392" /> the claim that in buying this horse we were going to boost the prestige of the Irish bloodstock industry.  I want to reiterate the case made by Deputy O'Donnell.  If the Americans had bought the horse&mdash;and we have no guarantee that the Americans ever offered a cent for the horse&mdash;and if the horse had gone to America surely everybody interested in horse breeding and horse racing in America would be aware of the fact that it was an Irish horse?  Surely that would be enough to advertise the qualities of our Irish bloodstock instead of having to run hat in hand to the Aga Khan imploring him to give us this animal for £250,000 for God's sake.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister came into the House and tried to make a case as if he were dealing with a nation of morons or with people who could not understand plain English or who could not observe what people were doing.  The Minister said that this money was not for the purpose of buying Tulyar but for the purpose of adding to the capital of the National Stud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to relate the unemployment position to this question of expenditure on Tulyar. It has been suggested by Deputies on the far side of the House that the Labour Party is trying to put it across that this £250,000 should be divided up amongst the 90,000 unemployed, and that that is the Labour Party's policy in regard to the expenditure.  Of course, it is not, but we do say that there are very many projects in this country upon which the money could be better spent.  One such project&mdash;that of afforestation &mdash; was mentioned by Deputy O'Leary.  It could do with an injection of £250,000.  There are many Fianna Fáil Deputies who would not object to £50,000 or £100,000 being expended by county councils on road schemes in the country rather than having the money sent away for the benefit of the Aga Khan and his Royal Highness Prince Aly Khan and company.  Somebody mentioned the road grants.  I do not want to be drawn into irrelevancies.</P>

      <P>This is beyond all question a gamble.  Everyone but those interested in horse-racing or horse-breeding feels that it is an untimely and unwarranted expenditure.  No matter what side-stepping may be indulged in by the Minister for Agriculture, the Government must accept responsibility for providing this £250,000.  It is sad to hear a Minister say that all he has to do is to put up the money, that once he is asked by the National Stud for the money he must pay it out, that he cannot even question what it is for.  Surely that makes a complete farce of parliamentary representation?  If £250,000 is to be taken out of the national coffers, whether it is from foreign investments or investments at home or revenue it is coming out of the pockets of the people of Ireland.  Otherwise we would not be talking about it here and we would not be asked about it.  It is terrible to see the Minister trying to put it across that we have no right to discuss or question what this is to be expended on; that he is not concerned and has no right to question the expenditure of this money.  Everyone knows <Col N="2397" /> the Minister must have been well informed of the progress of negotiations about the purchase of this horse.</P>

      <P>I want to advert to certain criticisms which were made in regard to the Labour Party and myself particularly in this debate.  It is suggested by the Fianna Fáil Party that these unemployed people, when they get an opportunity to see the <i>Irish Press</i> and read about Tulyar, their hearts will be lifted up because we have wrapped the Green Flag successfully around Tulyar.  That is the plan of attack now&mdash;when all else fails, try to shroud him in some talk of national pride.  What national pride can we have in having a racehorse and 90,000 unemployed people?  Is it not more important that human beings should be given a chance of life, rather than that we should purchase this <Col N="2401" /> animal at this juncture?  The time will come, undoubtedly, when the country will be able to afford to purchase bloodstock of this nature but that time is not in the immediate future, because it is quite obvious that Deputy Cowan and the Fianna Fáil Party are going to hang on to office as long as they can.</P>

      <P>If it is going to be insured, will it be insured by the State, through some machinery of the State, by an Irish insurance company, or a cross-Channel or foreign insurance company? If it is going to be insured, what is to be the amount of the premium?  We have not been told that. It has been variously estimated by those who are supposed to know that it will run to £8,000 or £9,000 a year, provided he lives.  In spite of efforts to prove the contrary, we had an admission that the Aga Khan has certain rights in regard to nominations, that he must get certain nominations in respect of this horse.  We have had some people suggesting that the ordinary farmer is going to benefit by this measure.</P>

A drowning man will inevitably clutch at a straw.  That is what we see happening now&mdash;and happening to the Independents, in particular.  Whatever chance there is for the ordinary able seamen to carry on, there is no chance at all for the stowaways.  They have no hope for the future.  Therefore, they clutch at any straw at all that floats past them.  This is one of the straws and this is one of the alleged reasons given by Deputy Cowan why the Labour Party are opposing this Bill.  He said that there were British influences.  Is it not well known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make this point in connection with the Money Resolution.  Is it not well known that many of the major figures in the bloodstock industry in this country are nonnational? I have no criticism to make of them on that score: it is nothing to their discredit.  If they are engaged in that industry and helping it and promoting it, that is all to the good. Surely, however, it is completely dishonest and completely false for any Deputy to come in here and try to impute to members of the Labour Party a motive of that nature?  Deputy Cowan has seen fit to refer, even on this debate, to the revered name of the late James Connolly.  James Connolly would turn in his grave if he could hear Deputy Cowan mention his name.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I want to say that no matter how the purchase of Tulyar may be white-washed in this House&mdash; and people are likely to get an entirely wrong slant on the matter if they stay too long within the confines of this House&mdash;there is a very cold drizzle of public opinion outside that will wash off that white-wash and reveal Tulyar for what he is&mdash;a good horse, maybe, but an untimely purchase for this State. Do not forget that the unemployed are increasing in numbers at the rate of 1,000 per week.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister to give this House an assurance, in the course of his reply, that the rumour which is afloat from very reliable sources&mdash;and those sources are very closely connected with the directors of the National Stud&mdash;is without foundation?  It is to the effect that this purchase of Tulyar is only the first of three purchases&mdash;that in the course of the next few months a further animal will be purchased for the sum of £175,000, and that a third animal will be purchased for a sum of £183,000 within the next six months.  According to rumour, the orders for those animals are already placed with the responsible British sales authorities. That would seem to indicate that the £250,000 which the House is now asked to vote for the purchase of this particular animal is merely the first of three sums of money to be paid for three animals, in all, and that an additional sum of £358,000 will have to be provided within the next six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the widespread criticism there has been in connection with the purchase of this animal out of public moneys, I think it is only right that the Minister should get an undertaking from the National Stud authorities that this will be their last expensive purchase.  The Minister is seeking approval for this purchase and <Col N="2409" /> is now driving this Bill through the House.  Can we have an assurance from him that, if a majority in the House give approval to it, it will be the last one to be made and that we will be finished once and for all with this wilful waste?  I know from reliable information, and I venture to say the Minister is also aware of the fact, that this is only one of three animals which the National Stud authorities intend to purchase.</P>

      <P>The House is being asked to vote £250,000.  I say the Minister should be in a position to give details of every penny which the House votes to the National Stud authorities, and tell us how this money is to be spent.  A Deputy asked for information last week, by way of parliamentary question, with regard to the insurance of this animal.  He asked whether it was a fact that the animal had been insured only for £10,000.  Can the Minister give us some information about that now?  Can he tell us what is the amount of the insurance premium, and if it is a fact that the animal has been insured with a British insurance company and not an Irish insurance company?  We ought to have that information since we are going to spend £250,000 on what Deputy Briscoe has described as a gamble.</P>

      <P>When a gamble is embarked on in this way I think it is only right that steps should be taken to protect the taxpayer against losses on the gamble.  There should be, for example, sufficient insurance cover.  I know that if I were supporting the Fianna Fáil Government I would insist on proper safeguards for the taxpayer. Can we be told if this animal is being insured for £10,000.  That information has been given out by those who are closely connected with the National Stud.  Is the animal being insured with an Irish insurance company or a British company?  I am told it is a British company.  That is a matter which Deputy Cowan should be gravely concerned about, seeing that he is so interested in Irish companies and in Irish concerns getting business, and concerned, too, in the development of our live stock.</P>

We have been told that the National Stud has £50,000 on hands.  In view of that, why should they have asked for more than £200,000 in connection with the purchase of this horse?  Is the Minister satisfied that the National Stud authorities are warranted in carrying out improvements at the present time especially in view of the fact that there has been a cutting down on the building of houses and the carrying out of public works.  Surely, this is no time for the National Stud to undertake reconstruction work.  Can the Minister tell us what is the nature of the work that they propose to carry out?  Is it proposed to have hot and cold water running through the stalls and to provide Odearest mattresses for the horses instead of a straw bed?</P>

Those people are neither Irish in name nor in origin.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked us to vote £250,000 for the development of the National Stud and I think Deputies are entitled to offer suggestions and opinions as to how that money could be much more gainfully employed for the benefit of the Irish people and not for the benefit of foreigners who have been coming in here over the years.</P>

      <Col N="2417" /> I come from a rural constituency from which the people are going to England day after day.  Only last Sunday I saw eight small farmers' houses closed up as the occupants had gone over to England to try to earn a living which has been denied to them by the Irish Government.  Could not the money be more gainfully employed in helping such people?  I believe and the people of the country believe that it could be.  Time and time again I have drawn the attention of this House to the plight of many small farmers particularly on the southern and western seaboards.  Many of these have to contend with uneconomic holdings and find it very difficult to eke out an existence.</P>

      <P>I will not go into detail.  On a number of occasions I put before the Minister for Agriculture the plight of these small farmers and the Minister had no suggestion to make.  He had no money in the kitty and he did not extract any money from the taxpayers to help to subsidise that section of the community.  That is one way in which this money could be more gainfully employed.  In view of the ruling of the Chair, I will not go into the matter in any more detail.  There are, however, a number of other matters.  We will take another industry which, owing to the policy of the Minister, is rapidly dying out&mdash;the poultry industry.  We heard a lot from Deputies on the other side as to how Deputy Dillon was killing that industry, but he was only trotting after this Government judging by the way they are wiping out that industry.</P>

      <P>You said you would allow Deputies to offer suggestions as to how this money could be more gainfully employed, but debarred them from going into detail, and I am acting on your instructions.  In order to give an outline without going into detail, of how the money could be more gainfully employed, I am pointing out a few things which come under the Minister's Department.  If they did not, I would not mention them. The Minister is asking the House for £250,000 to subsidise a few titled gentlemen.  At least one of those associated with the racing industry is a baron.  I do not want to mention the names of people, but there is one thing about Baron X&mdash;he is not Irish. I think the same thing can be said about some of those other gentlemen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the best, this proposal can only be described as a gamble.  I come from a constituency where there are many people finding it difficult to live at present.  We have a huge number of unemployed.  We have a number of people who, through circumstances beyond their control, are forced to go to the labour exchanges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not mentioned the unemployed before. They are forced, through circumstances beyond their control, to degrade themselves by seeking charity to help them to exist.  The people of this country <Col N="2420" /> do not usually look for charity.  They are more apt to demand justice and that whatever Government is in power should act fairly and squarely towards them and give them an opportunity to earn a living and not ask them to make beggars of themselves by looking for a few shillings in order to exist. That is the attitude of the people of West Cork or any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>Would not this £250,000 for the purchase of Tulyar and to subsidise a section of the community residing in or around Dublin be more usefully employed in providing some productive employment for all these people who are forced to draw public assistance at the present time?  That is one way in which this money could be more gainfully employed.  I think this is an outrageous proposal, and if we were to speak on it for the next three days I think we would not have completed what we would have to say about such a purchase.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of sneering at Deputies who have opposed this measure.  We have had a good deal of sneering on the part of people who have not contributed in any other way to the debate.  I would not mind a Deputy sneering if he had made a case for the purchase of Tulyar, but it is entirely out of place for Deputies who have offered no contribution to be interrupting and passing adverse comments. We have been called anti-national because we oppose this proposal to expend a sum of £250,000 on subsidising the bloodstock industry. Those who opposed the motion introduced here by Deputy Dunne to provide money out of public funds in order to give employment to our people were not described as anti-national. There was no sneering when that motion was opposed by the present Government.</P>
      <P>There is sneering now because we object to subsidising the people engaged in the bloodstock industry, people I feel sure who are closely os-sociated with the Minister and with his pal, Deputy Briscoe.  However, we are able to take the sneering.  We do not mind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2421" /> Has any Government a right to gamble with the people's money?  We have been told time and time again that it is necessary and obligatory for the Irish people to tighten their belts. that they are living beyond their means and that unless they are more careful the nation will be faced with disaster. In the midst of all the gloom and facing the threat of disaster we find the Minister for Agriculture coming in here not with a message of hope, not with a proposal to help the poor small farmer, not with a proposal to help the unemployed but with a proposal to subsidise the most anti-national section of our people.</P>

      <P>If Tulyar continues to be a wonder horse he may benefit Deputy Briscoe but he will not benefit any of the people whom I represent.  I am quite within my rights in objecting in the most forcible manner to the expenditure of this money for this purpose.  Such a measure could only be conceived by people who have no practical knowledge of the needs and requirements of our citizens at the present time.  I am sure there will be an outcry in the City of Dublin because of the increased price of butter.  I will not discuss the merits or demerits of that increase because I contend that every section of the community is entitled to its fair share of the national loaf.  However, as a result of the recent increase, families in Dublin will have to do without butter on their bread. Many of them in Deputy Briscoe's constituency will have to do without it.</P>
      <P>Would it not be better to devote this money to subsidising agriculture and subsidising the dairying industry.  Since 1931 the number of milch cows has decreased by 50,000.  The reason why the number has depreciated to such an extent is because dairying is no longer an economic proposition.  Something could be said in favour of devoting this money to subsidising the dairying industry or helping the store cattle trade about which the Minister professes himself to be so mindful when he is down in Cork.  When he is up here we hear nothing about helping the dairying industry, only helping the Aga Khan.  We outbid every other country for this horse.  The Government has described our financial position as being unsound.  But when this horse comes on the market we are able to outbid every other country. Her Majesty, who is also interested in racing, could not compete with us.  She could not afford to give £250,000 for this horse.  She has more sense.  The English racing interests could not compete with us.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hara reminded me of a point I want to make in connection with America. The opposition to the Irish taxpayer in regard to the purchase of Tulyar was alleged to come from America.  It was suggested that the Irish taxpayer might have had to pay £80,000 more because some racing interests in America were prepared to pay £330,000 for Tulyar. The Minister thought we were going to clap him on the back and say: &ldquo;Good boy, Tom.  You have saved the Irish taxpayers £80,000.&rdquo;  I agree with the suggestion put forward by some previous speakers that that was a bogus bid.  It was a bid which was alleged to be made in order to inflate the price of the horse and to spur on our Irish National Stud, with the taxpayers' money in their pocket, to outbid this alleged competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no evidence that there was anyone in America willing to pay £80,000 more for the horse, but we have sufficient evidence that the Aga Khan is a man of sense.  If he received an offer of £80,000 more from racing interests in America he would not sell for £250,000.  The Minister is smiling <Col N="2424" /> but if he went to Castlecomer Fair with a couple of calves and if he was offered £30 by one buyer and £35 by another buyer, would it be a generous gesture on his part to say to the man who offered £35: &ldquo;I do not want your money.  I want to sell them to the man who offered £30&rdquo;?  I am sure he would not do that.  It is not the practice and the Aga Khan, Prince Aly Khan and Rita Hayworth, as well, would certainly take the same line.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the Aga Khan did not say to the Minister's representatives: &ldquo;Although I am bid £330,000 for the horse, I will sell him to you for £250,000.&rdquo;  On these facts we can assume that this was a bogus bid.  If that is correct we can assume that a grave injustice has been done to the Irish people.  With regard to the value of the horse, this horse was owned by the wealthiest man in the world, the Aga Khan.  He is reputed to be so wealthy that he cannot possibly say what his actual income is.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to say whether we got value for our money or not.  I do not think we did. The vendor of the horse is a very wealthy man, and we all know he is prominently associated with racing in the world.  He is the principal racehorse owner in the world, and he is a man to whom a sum of £250,000 does not seem to be a large amount.  If Tulyar is all that he is claimed to be, why did the Aga Khan sell him to us? He has plenty of stables and plenty of money to maintain him.  Why did he not keep the horse himself?</P>
      <P>When you examine this question minutely you are forced to the conclusion that the Aga Khan could have kept the horse himself if he thought the horse was worth keeping, but when the Minister and his representatives were prepared to pay £250,000, so much the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe finds great amusement in this.  It is nearly impossible for me to keep from smiling at him. I do not want to delay the House any longer.  This is no laughing matter. When I return to my constituency to-morrow night and meet the people in Skibbereen and Dunmanway, and when they are discussing the payment of £250,000 for Tulyar, there will be nothing to sneer at.  They will be asking what efforts I made to have this £250,000 devoted to providing employment for them or to subsidise something in which they are interested. They will ask what efforts we made to prevent this sum of money from going to subsidise the racing chiefs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2426" /> There is nothing to sneer at in regard to this £250,000 nor in regard to the £450,000 that we passed on to the air services a short time ago.  If there was a referendum addressed to the people on this matter, I am convinced that not one in 20 of our people would favour the purchase of this horse.  Not one in 20 would favour the extortion of £250,000 either through direct taxation or through hidden taxation such as was imposed by increasing the tax on drink, tobacco and other commodities which the humbler sections of the people use.  If there was a referendum on this measure, the Irish people would outvote its supporters by 20 to one.</P>
    <P>I hope some stroke of luck will come our way that will prevent us from having to pay that £250,000 for Tulyar. However, if we buy him I hope he will be a huge success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that this Money Resolution will be carried through, this money will be made available to the National Stud.  I want to put to the Minister a few questions. Considering that the taxpayers' money will be made available for this purpose, I would like to know if the Minister would have at least some discretion. Will he be consulted in some way in regard to the management of this Stud, particularly in relation to Tulyar?  I understand that the services of this the Minister and his representatives animal will be confined to a very limited number of pedigree mares. Possibly it will be decided that a mare must have three or four generations of good breeding stock in order to qualify for service.  I would be in favour of having the services of this animal made available to the greatest possible number of mares.  If it is decided that a mare must have four generations of thoroughbred breeding, I would be in favour of reducing the qualifying number to two or three generations so that a greater number of owners would benefit from the expenditure of this public money.  I think it is up to the Minister to ensure that the money will be utilised to the greatest advantage. The Minister has indicated that after he hands over the money he will not be able to dictate policy to the directors of the stud and that it will be a <Col N="2427" /> matter for them to operate the stud in their own way.  I feel that, as this is taxpayers' money, the Minister should at least have some strings tied to it and should be consulted to some degree, regarding the utilisation of this money.</P>
      <P>I should like also to have an assurance from the Minister that the operations of the National Stud resulting from this increase in capital will not be detrimental to small breeders in this country.  Small breeders are the backbone of the horse breeding industry and I believe there is a certain element of fear amongst them in regard to the future.  I should like the Minister in replying to indicate whether he has given some consideration to this matter and what the result of that consideration has been.  I feel myself that it is not very good business for this House to vote away taxpayers' money without having some strings attached to it, even if it were only to insist on having a report of the operations of the National Stud laid on the table.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary should interrupt in this fashion if we want to get the business of the House done.  When the Minister is replying, I should like to have from him some indication of the general policy of the National Stud. It is said that it is in the national interest to make this money available but I think it is only right that the Department of Agriculture and the Minister should be consulted in regard to the operations of the National Stud. I gather from what has been said already that, after this money has been made available, the National Stud will not have to consult the Minister and will have no obligation to those <Col N="2428" /> who will subscribe that money.  I believe that an assurance should be given to small breeders that the operations of this stud will not be to the detriment of the horse breeding industry in general.  I have heard that fear expressed and if there are any grounds for it I am sure the matter has been referred to the Minister.  I should like him to indicate when he is replying what the position is in relation to small breeders.</P>

      <P>This Resolution proposes to provide additional money for the management of the National Stud. Most Deputies here have assumed, notwithstanding the Minister's statement that he had no particular function or control over the National Stud management, that this money is needed for the purchase of Tulyar.  I wonder is that assumption correct?  The £250,000 will probably be used to promote the interests of bloodstock breeding in the country but, so far as I know, there is nothing to suggest that the management of the stud could not use the money for any purpose that they in their wisdom may think fit.</P>
