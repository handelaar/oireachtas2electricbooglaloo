      <P>It is estimated that the sums which in mid-August, 1938, would have purchased the same quanta of essential goods (including rent) at retail as £1 at each of the dates specified were as follows:&mdash; mid-August, 1949, 10s. 10d.; mid-August, 1950, 10s. 10d.; mid-August, 1951, 9s. 9d.; mid-August, 1952, 8s. 11d.  The data needed to make the computation for January, 1953, are not available, and the latest corresponding figure is that of 8s. 10d. relating to mid-November, 1952.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the Dublin area as defined by the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, (a) the number of milch cows and heifers in calf, (b) total cattle and (c) the percentage relation of the former to the latter on the 1st June, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume, in view of a similar question by the Deputy to which I replied on 27th February, 1952, that the area to which he refers is the Dublin sale district as <Col N="1742" /> defined by the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, and by Orders made thereunder.  In the Dublin sale district on 1st June, 1952, (a) milch cows and heifers in calf numbered 21,181, (b) total cattle numbered 67,981, and (c) the former constituted 31.2 per cent. of the latter.</P>

      <P>The average daily quantity of whole milk sold or acquired for sale in the Dublin sale district as defined for the purposes of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, was 61,177 gallons during the year 1952, consisting of a daily average of 2,793 gallons from creameries and 58,384 gallons from producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the long delay in introducing proposals for legislation to compensate G.N.R. shareholders, and of the falling market price of some of the stocks, he will allay the anxieties of the stockholders, by informing them now when leave to introduce a Bill will be sought and further if he will assure these stockholders that the take-over prices which formed the basis of the offer of the railway to the two Governments are the prices that will ultimately be paid to each class of shareholder and state when such payments will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of legislation to give effect to the joint acquisition of the G.N.R. has entailed delay which has been unavoidable but I hope shortly to be in a position to introduce agreed legislative proposals. While all the terms of the proposals for legislation have not been finally settled, the decision as to the provisions relating to the purchase price will be taken with due regard to the interests of the majority of the stockholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> Payments to the stockholders cannot of course be made until the enabling legislation has been enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that there was until recently an arrangement in force by which importers of Ferguson trailers were refunded the import duty thereon if they were being used for agriculture and that such concession was withdrawn without warning to anyone, and if he will accordingly recommend the Revenue Commissioners to extend the concession to all those who imported for this use before the withdrawal of the concession was notified to the agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement under which facilities were granted for the duty free importation of tractor trailers intended for use by farmers for agricultural purposes terminated on the 12th March, 1952.  The concession was not confined to imports of any particular make of trailer.</P>
      <P>As a result of investigation and discussions with Irish manufacturers of trailers it was ascertained that they were in a position to meet all reasonable requirements at competitive prices.  It was, therefore, decided that the concession should be discontinued.</P>
      <P>A number of representations have been received, from Deputies and others, in this matter, and I have recently reconsiderd my earlier decision. I am now prepared, in those cases where the trailers were actually imported before the withdrawal of the concession was notified to importers, to recommend the Revenue Commissioners to make a refund of duty paid on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider dealing with cases where he is satisfied that there was an unconditional contract made before that date of which nobody could possibly know? I agree that the Minister must be the arbiter as to whether the contract is unconditional or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the owners of trailers imported between the 12th March last year, when the Order came into effect, and December last, during which period the purchasers were under the impression that the import duties would be remitted, will be refunded the duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that would be too sweeping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 60 and 70 purchasers of trailers knew nothing about this Order being revoked until December.  I think even the Minister's own Department was kept in ignorance of the fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by C.I.E. that the question of electrifying the suburban lines has been considered; that it was found that the capital costs of installation would be extremely heavy, and that the operating costs would also be excessive as compared with other forms of traction which have been under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that there is a local market for all the turf produced in the Littleton bog.  Apart from this I understand that the full production of this bog would not be sufficient to operate a generating station on a reasonably economic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position will be very serious <Col N="1745" /> in relation to unemployment in this area if there is not a market for this turf?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the bridge over the Dripsey River where it joins the Lee is to be removed by the E.S.B. in connection with their hydro-electric scheme; and, if so, if he will state what alternative provision is to be made, so that persons in the area will not be seriously inconvenienced by having to make long detours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The location of the bridge over the Dripsey River to be substituted for the bridge to which the question refers is shown on the plan attached to the River Lee Hydroelectric Scheme Approval Order 1949 (S.I. No. 321 of 1949), of which a copy has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that it is not intended to interfere with the existing bridge for about three years from now.  In the meantime the board will be prepared to consider any representations which may be made to them about the proposed alternative bridge accommodation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of public money made available to (a) An Bord Fáilte for the organisation of An Tóstal and (b) Fógra Fáilte for publicity for the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific allocation of public funds has been made either to An Bord Fáilte or to Fógra Fáilte for the purposes of An Tóstal.  Both boards are meeting their expenses in connection with An Tóstal from the Grants-in-Aid made to them for the promotion of tourism.  I have already furnished information, in reply to a <Col N="1746" /> question in Dáil Éireann on the 5th February, 1953, as to the expenditure incurred, and to be incurred, by each of the boards in the current financial year in connection with An Tóstal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  There is no specific allocation for either board for the purposes of An Tóstal.  The boards get money for tourist promotion purposes and it is for them to decide to what extent they will use that money for one purpose or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I could ask the board for the information, but I do not want it to be said that I influenced the policy of the board in matters of expenditure of that kind. They are financed by way of Grants-in-Aid and are statutorily entitled to expend these moneys for the purposes set out in the Act in accordance with their own discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Minister makes the apportionment but I am suggesting that the Minister should make available to this House information as to what apportionment was made by the board.  I will put the question down again next week in a different form.  Is the Minister aware that there are the most alarming rumours in Dublin circulated by people who have returned from America as to the manner in which this money is being spent?  I think it would be very advisable that these rumours should be dispersed by a true statement of the <Col N="1747" /> facts and that is what I want the Minister to give.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give details of the amounts of sterling transferred, for purchases, to each of the countries behind the &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; since 1945 and the headings of the ten principal commodities or the description of merchandise, etc., in respect of the purchase of which these applications were entertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is not precise as it does not define what he means by the term &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo;.  Moreover, if I apprehend correctly what the Deputy intends that term to connote, not all the countries that are now, to use his own phrase &ldquo;behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo; have been in that position since 1945.  In fact, many of such <Col N="1753" /> countries, according to my information, did not come under the domination of Communist Governments or Communist régimes, nor become completely satellites of the U.S.S.R., until dates subsequent to the 1st January, 1948; although two of them, Bulgaria and Rumania, were in that position some years earlier.  As transfers of foreign exchange between 1945 and 1948 were made only to&mdash;I hope this time I will not offend the susceptibilities of Deputy Flanagan&mdash;Czechoslovakia, of the countries which I have presumed the Deputy to have in mind in using the phrase in his question, and as this country was not during that period &ldquo;behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo;, I am confining my reply to the transactions of subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In view of the difficulties which I have experienced by reason of the imprecise term used by the Deputy, I have not been able, in the time available, to construct the detailed analysis, under commodity and other heads, of the currency transfers to countries &ldquo;behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo; which he has requested.</P>
      <P>Moreover, when the Deputy asks for &ldquo;details of the amounts of sterling transferred&rdquo; he is again being imprecise, as payments to these countries in the period in question were made in Irish currency to accounts in Irish banks of residents of the countries, in sterling to accounts in British banks of residents of the countries and, in the case of Czechoslovakia, in Czech currency.  Accordingly, I am giving him the approximate sterling value of all payments effected in Irish currency, sterling or foreign currency, expressed as global figures, for the years 1948-1952, inclusive, so far as such payments were made to all those countries to which I have assumed the Deputy's question refers:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I should warn the Deputy that these figures may be subject to material correction, by reason of the difficulty of determining, in the case of certain <Col N="1754" /> countries, at what precise date, particularly in the year 1948, the &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; may be regarded as having fallen upon them; for instance, in the case of Czechoslovakia, the Government of President Benes fell in February, 1948, but it is a matter of some conjecture as to when that country came completely within the category which I think the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <P>From what I have said the Deputy will readily understand that a good deal of research would be required in order to answer his question with any exactitude, and I am not certain that public value of the information sought would justify the expenditure of time and money which its ascertainment would necessitate.  I cannot, therefore, undertake to give the Deputy at any future date more precise or more detailed information than I have given to him to-day or than is available in the published trade statistics.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that, as a result of recent regulations <Col N="1758" /> issued by his Department entitled the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953, unemployment benefit payable to widows has been reduced to 12/- per week and that they receive no benefits normally allowed in respect of their dependent children; and, if so, if he will state the purpose of this regulation and take steps to revoke it so as to relieve the injustice and hardship imposed upon this category of insured persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under the social welfare schemes the simultaneous payment of more than one benefit to or in respect of any person is, in general, undesirable. Under the provisions of the regulations referred to in the Deputy's question, however, reduced rates of personal unemployment benefit are payable to recipients of widows' contributory or non-contributory pensions and reduced rates of allowance in respect of one or of each of two dependent children are payable to widows whose non-contributory pensions include provision for one or two dependent children.  The reduced rate of personal benefit is at least half of the appropriate weekly rate, and the reduced allowance of unemployment benefit is designed to bring the total provision for a dependent child to the weekly rate of 7/-.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will explain the present delay in obtaining transfers of unemployment contributions from Great Britain to the Republic under the reciprocal agreements of 1948; and, further, if he is aware that these delays impose undue hardships on contributors in so far as they are debarred from obtaining unemployment assistance and being submitted by employment exchanges for work on employment schemes pending their drawing of the benefit to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>The repeal of the Unemployment Insurance Acts and the bringing into force on the 5th January last <Col N="1759" /> of the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, relating to unemployment benefit terminated the operation of the agreement for reciprocity in the matter of insurance for unemployment benefit made in 1949 with the Minister of National Insurance in Great Britain.  A new agreement, which includes revised provisions relating to unemployment benefit has been made and is embodied in the Schedule to the Social Welfare (Great Britain Reciprocal Arrangements) Order, 1953, made by me on the 18th February.  The agreement has effect from the 5th January and action is proceeding to clear as expeditiously as possible the claims for unemployment benefit affected.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that these unfortunate migrants who return are now debarred from being submitted for employment at employment exchanges pending their drawing of whatever benefit to which they may become entitled? As a result, they are denied employment on special schemes.  Would he, in the meantime, pending an arrangement whereby payment of benefit may be expedited, consider permitting them to submit their names for employment on these special schemes?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that, on the basis of recent figures, 50,000 persons registering as unemployed on the live register would involve a weekly outlay of £38,900 for unemployment benefit and £15,800 for unemployment assistance.  Bearing in mind that a large proportion of the cost of administration does not vary with the numbers unemployed, the estimated weekly cost of the staff at employment exchanges in respect of an unemployment figure of 50,000 is £4,700 and of other administrative expenses (including proportion of salaries, etc. of headquarters staff) is £3,400.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state why no benefit has been paid to a person in <Col N="1762" /> Mylerstown, Nurney, County Kildare, in respect of the seven certificates forwarded by him for sickness benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations provide that a contribution card is due for surrender not later than 14 days after the expiry of the period.  Regulations further provide that a contribution card surrendered after the 30th November following the period of its currency is not effective for benefit purposes for four weeks following the date of its surrender.</P>
      <P>The contributions paid during the year ending July, 1952, govern the rate of benefit during the current year.  The insured person submitted evidence of incapacity as from the 2nd January, 1953, but his claim for benefit, together with his 51/52 period card did not reach the Department until 24th January, 1953.  No benefit would therefore be payable until 21st February.</P>
      <P>It has since been alleged that the card was surrendered to the local agent on 4th December, 1952.  This statement has been accepted, and the insured person's record has been amended accordingly.  Benefit amounting to £10 16s. covering the period covered by medical evidence has been issued.</P>

To <Col N="1764" /> quote one case, a man who had handed in seven certificates had returned to work without getting any benefit at all.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is about time he considered giving an official in the different areas executive authority to deal with local claims and so avoid the necessity of having to send for these claims to Dublin.  The sooner that is done the better it will be for everybody.</P>

Subsequently, by the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme, 1949, the increases in question were also applied to non-commissioned officers and men who had been discharged prior to the 22nd September, 1946.</P>
      <P>Further pension increases, based on pay increases which have taken place since the 1st September, 1949, are proposed for non-commissioned officers and men discharged since that date and will be provided for in an amending scheme which I hope to lay before the House soon.  The question of granting further increases to personnel discharged before the 1st September, 1949, based on increases in the cost of living or on currency depreciation, is, however, one that cannot be considered separately. It can only be dealt with in conjunction with any question of increases for similarly circumstanced State pensioners generally.</P>

There is no protection whatever for the fishing industry in the County Wexford.  The county has been invaded by French and British trawlers.  Last Saturday one of the fishermen told us that one of the foreign skippers in Kilmore told him that if the fish were on the bank they would &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; for them.

Statistics <Col N="1780" /> are not available as to the total production of highest grade milk during the year but I might mention that on the average the total number of cows kept during 1952 in the herds of the above producers was approximately 2,400.</P>

As regards the suitability for human consumption of the samples which failed the tests, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to questions by him in this matter on 13th and 26th March, 1952.  Data in respect of (3) loose unpasteruised milk will not be available from local authorities for another couple of months.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

The people objecting to it, however, are the type of people to whom we had references yesterday in connection with the purchase of Tulyar&mdash;such people as Colonel this, Major that and Captain the other, all foreigners who are depriving the Slaney fishermen of the advantage of the earlier opening.

      <P>There is no doubt that the purchase by the National Stud of the racehorse Tulyar has caused a lot of concern in the country as is evidenced by the publicity given to the purchase of the horse and the agitation that has ensued during the past few weeks.  I do not think that Deputy Dunne, as suggested by Deputy Briscoe, was entirely responsible for that agitation.  No matter how eloquent and how forceful Deputy Dunne might be, I do not think that he alone, or any other individual Deputy, could have caused so much publicity to be given to the purchase of this horse by the National Stud.</P>
      <P>My attitude towards this debate and towards the purchase of Tulyar by the National Stud for a sum of £250,000 is such that I hardly think it is worth my while to state in detail my objections to the expenditure of such a colossal sum of money on a racehorse.  I am not fitted to talk about the merits of the horse.  I have no intimate knowledge of horse-racing in this country or in any other country, nor am I interested in it except for the few odd shillings that I spend when I back a horse in the Grand National or the Derby or some other big race.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a fanatical desire on the part of some members of the Government Party and some members of the Fine Gael Party to retain in this country the best horse in the world and to make the horse-breeding industry in this country the best in the world.  I do not object to any Party or any individuals in this House having that <Col N="1789" /> ambition so far as the bloodstock industry in this country is concerned out have we shown the same desire in regard to other branches of agriculture or in regard to industry?  Have we shown the same desire to keep men in employment and to prevent men from emigrating?  I am not against the bloodstock industry.  This country is traditionally a breeder of horses and it is famous for it all over the world. I should have thought, however, that in the present situation the most important things in this country should come first.  I suppose it is true that the National Stud needs to be improved and advanced but is it the first priority in present circumstances?  It may be alleged that the Labour Party have a particular axe to grind or that we want to pander to a certain type of vote.  It has been said that £250,000 may represent a large sum of money to people with small minds.  So far as the country is concerned, I admit that, relevantly speaking, £250,000 may be a small sum of money but one might well ask, as it has been asked, to what would that £250,000 be devoted?  It was said, too, that if all the demands put forward here on behalf of the unemployed were acceded to, the sum of £250,000 would go only a very small way towards meeting the demands and fulfilling their requirements.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that Tulyar will be of benefit not only to the National Stud but ultimately to industry in this country and that he will be of some benefit as far as employment is concerned but the fact of the matter is that there is at the moment a serious unemployment situation that must be met immediately. I was amazed and in no small way shocked to learn, when I attended a branch meeting of my Party in County Wexford last Monday night, that approximately ten members of that small branch had gone to England, Wales or Scotland to seek employment. That is why I said here last night that it seems to me that there is a keener desire to keep Tulyar in this country than to keep men and women at home in this country and to provide work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase of Tulyar has been <Col N="1790" /> described as a capital investment.  I agree that it is a capital investment so far as the bloodstock industry of this country is concerned but is it the most important investment in which we should engage at the present time? If Tulyar will be of benefit to the country, that benefit will not become apparent, according to some of the racehorse experts, for some years to come.  Meantime, men are out of work and are emigrating.  If there is to be capital development, I am pretty well certain that the expenditure of even £250,000 on some scheme of capital development would put men in employment as early as next week.</P>

      <P>That is what I say.  As a result of the purchase of Tulyar, a large number of people will not be put into employment for some years to come.  I think it is reasonable to say, as other Deputies have said, that we would not object to the purchase of Tulyar in the circumstances that we knew this time in 1951 or in June, 1951&mdash;because there was then a situation in which unemployment had been relieved to a very great extent, no matter where the credit for that situation might be placed.</P>
      <P>I am not competent to say whether the price of £250,000 was an exorbitant price to pay for this racehorse.  It seems peculiar that we should have been described as bankrupt, that we should be described by the Taoiseach as being at our wits' end to try to balance the Budget and that, according to spokesmen of the Government, we should be at our wits' end in an endeavour to bring about a favourable figure in the balance of trade, and that yet, in these circumstances, we should be able to compete successfully in the negotiations which are supposed to have taken place with regard to the sale of this famous racehorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agitation was not provoked merely by Deputy Dunne.  Many Deputies of this House have, on a post office issue or on some other issue, tried to provoke a national agitation and have failed.  I do not think that <Col N="1791" /> Deputy Dunne's raising of this matter in this House was fanatical.  He was not thrown out of the House because of what he said.  He did not march with bands and waving flags in an agitation in regard to the purchase of Tulyar.  A question was raised by him on the Adjournment of the House, and the voice of the people, as demonstarted in the public Press, has shown that there is grave concern over the purchase of this horse in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. It may be all very well to talk about the importance of the horse breeding industry in this country.</P>
    <P>There is discontent in the minds of thousands and tens of thousands of our people over this purchase.  I do not suggest that the £250,000 should be given to the civil servants as a result of the findings of the arbitration board, or that it should be given to any particular class.  If it were to be so divided, the amount per head would be very small indeed.  My point is that this expenditure is having a demoralising effect on a big number of our people, especially when they see so many out of work, so many forced to emigrate, and so many State pensioners trying to exist on small pensions.  In view of all these circumstances, people regard this purchase as a luxury capital investment.</P>
    <P>We have natural resources and no attempt is being made to develop them. We have expressed the view that our ambition is to step up agricultural production&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All that I am claiming is the same indulgence as that given to practically every speaker on this Bill yesterday.  The reasons for expressing disapproval of this purchase are so obvious that my speech will be very brief.  I think that it would be nearly as logical to purchase the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, the liner <i>America</i>, or the fastest jet plane in the world.  I believe that the feelings <Col N="1792" /> I have expressed on this purchase reflect the feelings of the majority of the people who have been supporting the Labour Party in my constituency for many years.</P>
      <P>I think that the Government ought to reconsider this.  It seems to me that the National Stud took the decision to saddle this House and the country with this extra expenditure of £250,000 before the House was consulted.  I think it would be very much better if the Minister had to come to the House before the decision was taken and asked: &ldquo;Do you agree to this?&rdquo; As far as I can see, the purchase is now an accomplished fact.  We are committed to this expenditure.  It seems to me to be a fantastic sum to pay. The woman to whom I referred last night was of the same opinion.  She, knowing the wealth of the former owner of Tulyar&mdash;the Aga Khan&mdash;asked me quite simply: &ldquo;Is the Government going to purchase the Aga Khan?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that most Deputies, in discussing this Bill, appear to have lost sight of what the Minister said yesterday.  He said that, long before the purchase of Tulyar, authority was sought from the Government by the Board of the National Stud to bring in this Bill with a view to increasing the share capital of the company.  The Minister also emphasised that the Bill was necessary to enable the company to proceed with its programme of increasing its bloodstock and developing the National Stud.  Therefore, if Tulyar had never been bought this Bill would have been necessary.  I agree that the Labour Deputies would not find a great deal of publicity value in it if its purpose was simply to increase our bloodstock and develop the National Stud.  However, once the purchase of Tulyar was mentioned, a fine opportunity was presented to them of getting into the news. The Labour Deputies are taking every advantage of that.  They had great fun yesterday with descriptions of Deputy Blowick and Deputy Dunne on Tulyar. That provided them with great amusement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind racing is more than amusement.  It constitutes an important element in a great industry. <Col N="1793" /> It provides a great deal of employment, directly and indirectly.  That cannot be denied.  It is also a great asset to the tourist trade.  As the Minister pointed out yesterday, it can be very helpful, too, as regards the export of bloodstock to the dollar areas.  These are important considerations that we should not lose sight of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy, from the Labour Benches, spent a great deal of time yesterday telling us about certain classes who attend race meetings.  He tried to give the impression that it is only wealthy people who do so.  I attended one in my life.  I think that Deputy Murphy and his Labour colleagues know more about the Soviet Union than I do.  Even there racing is permitted.  They do that while they prate about the equality of income. Deputy Murphy would like us to believe that it is only the wealthy classes who attend race meetings. From what I know from meeting people I believe that the ordinary Dubliner or the ordinary man likes to attend a race meeting and to have a bob on his selection.  He gets great enjoyment from that.  I agree that if there is excessive gambling it can spoil the day's enjoyment at a race meeting.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the main purpose of this Bill is to enable the company to improve the bloodstock industry.</P>

      <P>At the Olympic Games in 1948 it was really wonderful to see the enthusiasm which the jumping of <Col N="1794" /> our Irish horses called forth.  It testified to their value as jumpers.  I saw the same at Helsinki in 1952.  It was really marvellous to see the honours which our Irish jumpers and horsemen won there.  Great enthusiasm was aroused as they paraded there carrying the Irish colours.  It is efforts of that kind that help to promote this great industry.  I should like to see the efforts of the Olympic Council of Ireland of which I happen to be a delegate, directed towards getting the games held in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I think it is worth mentioning.  If the games were held here we would not hear much complaint from Deputy Dunne.  I know, of course, that the purchase of Tulyar provided him and others with an opportunity for getting a great deal of publicity. They all seem, however, to have lost sight of the important thing and that is that the purchase of this horse can be of enormous value not only to our bloodstock breeding industry but to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only natural that a great many people should question our sense of proportion in proposing to pay such a large sum of money for one animal.  There has been a good deal of publicity in connection with the sale of this horse.  It was reasonable to expect, therefore, that a number of people would suggest other possible uses for a sum of money of this size.  I think, however, that there is another way of examining this matter.  Various suggestions have been made to the effect that it would be possible to utilise this money in other ways.  We also had indications given that we have available in the country adequate resources to provide for the development of schemes of such a character as may be considered necessary. I do not think that the Government can seriously contend in future that there is a shortage of money for essential development schemes.  The proposal which the Minister has introduced in this Bill is an indication that, <Col N="1795" /> whatever else may be wrong with our economy, there is no shortage of money for worth-while development.</P>
      <P>The fact that it is proposed to expend this sum of money on the purchase of a single racehorse has probably been magnified out of actual proportion to the capital money involved in the National Stud and out of proportion to the value of the bloodstock industry as a whole.  It is not a fair representation to suggest that the expenditure of £250,000 on the purchase of one animal can be isolated from the capital already invested in the National Stud and from the value to the country of the bloodstock industry.  This particular purchase was decided upon by the Board of the National Stud as part of a long-term policy to secure what they consider are the best breeding lines available so that the already high prestige of the bloodstock industry of this country may, if possible, be enhanced and its future assured.</P>
      <P>There have been a great many suggestions made here that money should be provided for other schemes, such as agriculture, industry, the relief of unemployment, and so forth.  I endorse almost all the suggestions made in that regard.  If money is required for the improvement of agriculture, for improving cattle, sheep, pigs, for any other schemes under the Department of Agriculture, for investment in secondary industries or for development schemes of any sound nature which will in the long run repay in improved economic conditions, there is no reason why the Government or the House should not make the money available.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly a fact that there is at the present time very considerable unemployment.  It is undoubtedly a fact that many schemes could be initiated which would not merely relieve that situation, but, in the long run, improve economic conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal before the House at the moment should be considered on its merits and in the light of the importance of the bloodstock industry to the country as a source of a valuable export trade, as an important source <Col N="1796" /> of employment, providing work almost entirely for male workers at good rates of wages.  The industry must be considered as a whole.  The fact that the National Stud is financed from State sources and that the directors considered it desirable to purchase this animal in the interests of the further development of the policy which they have operated, is merely an accident when considered in relation to the expenditure of this particular sum of money which appears, and which undoubtedly is, a very large sum even for an animal with the outstanding racecourse career of Tulyar.</P>
    <P>Almost every Deputy who spoke indicated that he had very little knowledge of the bloodstock industry.  In most cases it was obvious from the speeches made that the Deputies concerned had very little connection with bloodstock or with racing.  They all recognised the importance of the industry and the fact that the prestige of Irish horses, on the basis of performance on the racecourse, on the basis of performance in the Army Jumping Team and on the basis of the many magnificent performances by civilian riders who have represented this country abroad in jumping competitions, has probably attained an all-time high level.</P>
    <P>Many criticisms were expressed that we were buying an expensive horse from a rich man.  Admitting that that is true, I think it has been overlooked that the breeder of this horse has helped in enhancing the prestige of Irish breeding by running for very many years a number of large studs in this country which give a good deal of employment.  I do not suggest for a moment that the Aga Khan is doing that for the love of this country.  He is doing it because it is possible in Ireland to raise the best horses.  Over the last quarter of a century horses bred at the Irish studs run by the Aga Khan have achieved records never before attained and which it is unlikely will be reached in future.  He has bred four Derby winners and owned a fifth, possibly a sixth.  The other was bred in France.  He has owned Blenheim, Bahram, Mahmoud, Tulyar.  All of these were Irish-bred horses.  He bred three of them in this country; the <Col N="1797" /> other he bought but it was also bred here.  That has advanced the fame of the Irish racehorse.  The Aga Khan, in common with other breeders of bloodstock, has provided substantial employment in this country.  Bloodstock breeding has provided a very big export trade in the past, mainly to sterling areas and, in recent years, to the dollar area.</P>
    <P>The proposal by the National Stud to buy this horse has undoubtedly attracted world-wide attention.  It has attracted attention because of the large sum for which the horse has been purchased, because of the fame which Tulyar achieved on the racecourse, and the interest created has extended not only to Europe but even to the United States.</P>
    <P>I believe that the policy of the National Stud so far has been wise. In a few years they have achieved successful results.  It is common knowledge that up to the present the principal sire there has got what are regarded as short distance runners. In recent years the tendency has been for animals bred for speed, five or six furlong horses, to attract a very high price.  That is mainly because of the desire of those who invest in bloodstock to get a quick return.  As far as that goes, the National Stud provided the leading sire last year of short distance runners and the leading sire of two-year-olds.  They also have another sire, Preciptic, who sired the winner of one good race last year which has since been sold for a substantial sum to the United States.  That shows the interest which United States buyers have in securing Irish bloodstock.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, referred to the fact that in recent years many sires had been purchased for large sums and that some of them had been syndicated at high prices.  Some people have suggested that because it was possible to syndicate, through the means of private enterprise, a number of sires both here and in Great Britain that should be possible in this case. With few exceptions.  I think that almost all the sires that were syndicated were syndicated after they had shown results at stud.  Most large <Col N="1798" /> syndicates were formed after the horse had proved a success at stud.  That would mean that he had been anything from three to four years, or maybe five years, at stud.  In these cases, the persons concerned were naturally anxious to get an indication beforehand of the likely return before expending sufficient sums of money to purchase the animals in question.</P>
    <P>There have been undoubtedly cases in the past of very brilliant racehorses failing at stud to live up to their reputation and not transmitting their racing abilities to their progeny, or not to the same extent.  On the other hand, there have been cases of comparatively undistinguished horses, and in some cases horses of no racecourse merit, becoming great sires.  There is one thing on which breeders will agree, that there is what might be described as no royal road to success in breeding.  It is generally accepted, however, that by breeding from animals with a good or proven pedigree, proper conformation and good racecourse performances the prospect of securing progeny which will in turn achieve success on the racecourse is more likely than by breeding from animals which have shown little racing ability.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, it is accepted that it has been the experience of breeders generally that there is a better prospect of breeding the best horses from animals of proven racecourse ability and from well-established lines, then I think it will be accepted that the proposal to buy this racehorse on performance and on pedigree is a sound one.  There have been undoubtedly many examples of horses who had very successful racecourse careers not proving successful at stud. On the other hand, horses that were unsuccessful on the racecourse have proven successful at stud.  But, on the assumption that, by and large, those that have proved themselves on the racecourse will transmit that ability to their progeny, the proposal to buy this horse meets with my approval.</P>
    <P>I agree that the sum of money involved is a large one and criticism may be expressed that it would be possible to utilise it in other ways. But the fact that there is in this <Col N="1799" /> country a National Stud which has over a great number of years, either under the former owners' management or since it has come under our own control, achieved a high reputation places on the directors of that stud a responsibility to see that the place of the National Stud in the bloodstock industry of this country is maintained.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, a great number of Deputies have approached this matter on the basis that, because their own particular constituency has no special interest in bloodstock, and because horse-breeding is not an important economic interest in certain areas of the country, the proposal should not be approved.  I do not think that we can approach big economic questions on a parochial basis.  Merely because one scheme is appropriate to one locality, it does not follow that such a scheme should be developed in another locality.  There are undoubtedly certain parts of the country where the horse-breeding industry is more important than in others.  But, taking the country as a whole and the economy as a whole, the people of this country recognise the value of the bloodstock industry. They recognise its value to the national economy.  They recognise the prestige which this country obtains through its horses and through its riders.  That prestige is based on solid foundations.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in recent years we have heard the word prestige abused.  We have seen all sorts of unsound efforts made to achieve prestige in spheres in which we cannot compete.  We are competing in this sphere as masters and as those who have over the years succeeded in attaining a reputation unsurpassed by any other country, and one which has not only attracted to his country many people anxious to invest money here but has also resulted in great numbers of our own people developing and extending their interest in this industry because of its advantage to themselves, because of the employment it gives, and because of its economic strength from the point of view of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> I regret that in the course of this debate some references were made to individuals.  Some names were introduced here yesterday, perhaps inadvertently, by Deputy M.P. Murphy, who referred to an individual he saw mentioned in a paper from which he was quoting and suggested that because that individual had an army title&mdash; and I think another title too&mdash;he had no interest in this country.  I think it is only right to say that the particular individual to whom the Deputy referred has not only lived here but so have generations of his family for many years back and they have always provided good employment and are held in high repute by their neighbours and by all sections of the community and are looked upon as a family which has not only given good employment but has demonstrated its interest in the nation and in the welfare of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>If we have a National Stud that stud should be run on the basis of producing only the best and the best can only be achieved by endeavouring to breed along the lines that are considered by the experts to be the correct lines.  If this is not the appropriate occasion I would like on some future occasion to suggest that it is time something was done to bring the control of racing within the sphere of influence of some statutory body.  The racing industry is now so important it can no longer be left in the control of individuals who have no particular claim to the exercise of that control and many of whom have no status from the point of view of the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board was established to deal with certain aspects of the racing industry.  The time has arrived when full control over that industry should be exercised by a statutory body appointed for that purpose.  The introduction of this Bill gives us an opportunity of expressing the view that it is time in the national interest that some of those who control racing here should be replaced by those who have the interests of the nation at heart and the interests of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The importance of the racing industry is now so great that the time <Col N="1801" /> has come when the old-time control and the old-time responsibility must be replaced by a body having certain defined responsibilities under statute. So important is the industry now that it is essential that it should be directed along the right lines and that those who so direct it must have not only the confidence of those earning their livelihood in it but the confidence of the people as well.</P>
    <P>I hope that the purchase of this horse will be followed by the same success at stud as the horse has had on the racecourse.  Deputy Dillon expressed the hope yesterday that this horse would not be run again this year.  I agree with Deputy Dillon in that.  It is, I admit, a matter for the National Stud, and it is they who will have the task of deciding that matter in view of the fact that many arrangements have already been made for the coming season between the owners of mares and stallions.  It is worthy of note that a great many successful sires were never raced.  It is also worthy of note that some horses that had during their racing careers very hard races indeed were subsequently a failure at stud.  The converse is also true.  This horse has achieved on the racecourse everything that was expected of him.  He has done everything that enabled him to achieve the reputation that he has to-day.  Any further racing may involve the risk of tarnishing his already high reputation. I take it the directors will decide in the light of their mature judgment and consideration.</P>
    <P>The proposal to expend this sum on the purchase of one animal will not, of course, prevent more money being provided in the future for other purposes.  The importance of the industry and its value to the country places on the directors of the National Stud the responsibility of ensuring that the best will always be provided whenever it is available for the use of breeders here so that our reputation may be maintained throughout the world.</P>

      <P>Listening to some of the speakers here one would imagine <Col N="1802" /> that a Deputy had no right to intervene in this debate unless he has an interest in bloodstock or in racing.  I am sure there are very few Deputies here who have not at some time or another attended race meetings and had a flutter on a horse.  I admit I am one of them but I do not for a moment subscribe to the statement that unless a Deputy has a direct interest in racing and in bloodstock he is not entitled to speak in this debate.  Every Deputy is here as a representative of his constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher has told us that in this Bill we are advancing a sum of money towards the development of the National Stud, and Tulyar has really nothing at all to do with it.  No matter how the Minister or Deputy Gallagher may paint the picture it is simply because of the purchase of this famous racehorse the State is now providing a sum of £250,000 for the National Stud.  Many Deputies have referred to this sum as a colossal sum. Even those who are in favour of this purchase have admitted that the sum is a big sum.  The only case that can be made is that it is a long-term investment and that from that point of view it is a good investment, but one hears of businessmen and firms who invest money hoping that that investment will show a profit ten years hence.  Ten years hence they sometimes find that it does not show a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I prefer to take the view of an Irish Catholic paper&mdash;I have here a copy of the <i>Irish Catholic</i> dated 4th February, 1953&mdash;rather than accept the statement made by many Deputies here in relation to that long term policy.  This gives us an account over ten years roughly to show that there are other ways rather than the purchase of Tulyar to bring a net gain to the country more profitable than investing in the bloodstock business.  We have to-day&mdash;and I believe he is right&mdash;the Minister for Education going around the country telling us the condition of national schools, that they are hovels and that many of them would want to be repaired.  I am sure it is on account of that that the <i>Irish Catholic</i> presents <Col N="1803" /> a balance sheet as far as Tulyar is concerned.  I quote from it and the date is the 12th February, 1953.  It starts off: &ldquo;That £250,000&mdash;Tulyar's welfare or your child&rdquo;.  It then produces a profit and loss account.  It takes the year 1953.</P>

    <P>I think that is an answer to the long-term policy that we heard about from the great financier, Deputy Briscoe, and to a certain extent from Deputy Cosgrave, who has just spoken.  As far as I am concerned spending £250,000 on this horse is done for one purpose alone and that is to accommodate the bloodstock breeders and the racehorse owners in this country.  There are, roughly, 25 people concerned, and this £250,000 is spent to accommodate those people in getting a sire into the National Stud.  They are the richest section of the community and it is my view that it should be left to themselves to pay for that horse.  They are very well able to do so.  In a few years' time, with the sale of the yearlings, the two-year-olds or the three-year-olds, as the case may be, they themselves are the very people who will gain by it and not the taxpayers of the country who are now filling the bill in paying for this animal for them.</P>
    <P>What advantage will it be to the general taxpayers of this country&mdash;to follow Deputy Briscoe's argument&mdash; that in two years' time we will hear of so many thousands of pounds being secured for the yearlings and, later on, so many thousands of pounds for the two-year-olds?  It is of advantage to the 25 or 30 breeders, as I have said. They are the people who will be gaining, and they are the people who should pay for this animal.  They are very well able to do so.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Briscoe said this is a gamble.  I am sure Deputy Briscoe <Col N="1804" /> was in many good gambles in his time; so were other Deputies&mdash;sometimes successfully and sometimes otherwise. A person is entitled to gamble with his own money, but it is my view that the Government is not entitled to gamble £10, let alone £250,000, of the people's money.  A person is entitled to gamble his own money if he wishes to do so, but definitely a Government or a company is not entitled to gamble people's money; the Government is not entitled to gamble the money of the taxpayers of the State any more than the company is entitled to gamble the money or the property of their shareholders.</P>
    <P>I will vote against this measure not for the reason which has been put forward by Deputy Dunne and the Labour Party but for the simple reason that I believe it is not money that will be spent to the advantage of our people. I have no doubt it will be of advantage to the sections I have mentioned but certainly they are the people who should pay for this animal, because if this animal is a success they are the people who will gain from its purchase.</P>
    <P>Up to lately, I thought this country was completely robbed by the outgoing Government.  From what I heard down the country there was not a penny in the kitty.  It was completely swamped by Deputy Norton, by the inter-Party Government and by Deputy Costello. It was only when the magic Fianna Fáil Party got into power, with the assistance of the type of individual to whom I will not refer, that we were able to do away with that debt and build up this country again.  Is it not remarkable that all of a sudden £250,000 has come to the fore to buy a racehorse to suit the class in favour of whom Fianna Fáil must forget the people, when something like this crops up, and support motions and Bills of this description?  Of course, that Government was more than generous of late.  This action of theirs is only in keeping with the abolition of the dance tax.  They are very sporting people. They love dancing so they abolish the dance tax.  They love horse-racing and they have bought a sire at £250,000. They also helped a certain class when they gave back £1,000,000 to the <Col N="1805" /> tobacco manufacturers in this country. They love all those classes of people while they have turned around and forgotten the taxpayers, the people for whom they bleed at election time.</P>
    <P>Some people say that if this country were better off, if we were in a better position financially, they would not object to this purchase.  I would object to it at any time.  Just imagine, we competed against the British Government and against the American Government. We were able to buy them out and purchase this racehorse notwithstanding the fact that we have in this small country of ours the greatest number of registered unemployed that ever existed.  Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side shake their heads.  I know they will be marched into the Lobby whether they like it or not.  Any of them who are allowed to speak are told what to say and when it comes to the vote they must march blindly into the Lobby to vote for it because it is a Fianna Fáil scheme.  That is the only consideration they give it.</P>
    <P>Listening last night to Deputy Seán Flanagan and Deputy Moran, both from South Mayo, one would imagine that the people around Swinford, Kiltimagh, Claremorris and from the mountains around Partry, were all delighted at the purchase of Tulyar. I wonder whether Deputy Flanagan or Deputy Moran will go amongst the people in the rural areas in South Mayo or whether Deputy Killilea, who is afraid to come into this House to defend the action of the Government but who will blindly vote in support of it later on, will go into North Galway or stand up in this House and say that the people of South Mayo or the people of rural areas in North Galway are definitely behind the purchase of Tulyar?  Of course, Deputy Séan Flanagan down in Claremorris or in any other district in South Mayo will not make the case that he made here last night for such a purchase.</P>

      <P>There is a hole in <Col N="1806" /> Wicklow that you will soon be buried in.  I met a man last night who was speaking of the purchase of Tulyar, and he said: &ldquo;I do not blame Fianna Fáil at all for that purchase.  They had to do it.  That timber structure they are erecting in O'Connell Street is for the purpose of showing him during the Tóstal.&rdquo;  People will tell you also of certain sections who go racing who would support this purchase.  I am talking of the &ldquo;Haw-Haw&rdquo; crowd who appear to be supported a little bit on my right here. I suppose there is a mixture of that element on both sides of the House and the quicker we see both of them together the better it will be for the country.  A member of that &ldquo;Haw-Haw&rdquo; crowd, I have been informed, recently remarked: &ldquo;You have no comfort at all going to races nowadays. The damn place is blocked up with farmers.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; another of them said, &ldquo;some of them have the cheek even to go on the grand stand.&rdquo; That is the mentality, in my view, of the racing element in this country.  It is because of that mentality and because the people in the rural areas are opposed to this waste of money that I, as one Deputy, oppose this Bill and will vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking that before Deputy Donnellan would finish he would try to draw moral support from some source in defence of his argument, because it appears now as if Deputy Donnellan, no matter what the debate hinged round, is going to adopt the rôle of moralist and defender of the faith.  I do not see what moral issue is involved in this simple debate regarding the question of the purchase of a racehorse.  As Deputy Cosgrave said, one must not be parochial in one's outlook on this question.  Goodness knows, the people of Donegal have little interest in the National Stud but they have sufficient intelligence to realise that an industry which is world famous is entitled to the support of the nation as a whole. This country has acquired a world reputation for the products of a few of its industries.  Bloodstock is one of them.  If we take further steps to enhance that reputation and to <Col N="1807" /> increase our prestige in that direction, I think these steps must have the full support of every person in the country who is alive to the importance of national industry.  These are the lines along which anybody is bound to view the steps that have been taken to enhance the reputation of Irish bloodstock, steps such as the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>I think the publicity which the purchase of Tulyar has received and the adverse criticism from those who would like to cash in on it and use it as a vote-catching issue by playing on the susceptibilities of the unemployed and the weaker sections of the people, will in itself enhance the high reputation we hold as the best bloodstock producing country in the world.  Since it can be proven beyond doubt that the purchase is a wise one and a sound one and that it is bound to show a profit as the years go by, I fail to see why anybody should try to make capital out of it at this stage or try to prove that by the purchase of a horse, even for this gigantic figure, we are neglecting some section of the community. Exactly the same argument could be used with regard to expenditure on any other industry in the country.  Why do we spend so much on tourism? Because it is a good industry which shows a good return and is of some national benefit.  If we follow up the arguments we hear from the Clann na Talmhan and Labour Benches we would not spend money on any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison between the money spent on the purchase of this horse and money spent on an industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. If we were to follow that argument to its logical conclusion, we would be reluctant to spend money on any industry that shows a good return.  We would be reluctant to spend money on tourism, on agricultural shows and various other things which cost a lot but which are calculated to enhance the prospects of the industries with which they are concerned.  I think we should be quite satisfied to support national industries that are world <Col N="1808" /> famous and that will eventually bring better returns to the national purse as a whole.  There is no use in following the line of argument that this money could be used in this, that or the other way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan suggested that the money might be better invested in improving our schools.  If we can maintain our national economy and assist national industry to expand, we enrich the nation as a whole and then, in ten years' time or so, we shall be in a better position to improve any institutions of the State on which we wish to spend money.  All our efforts should be directed towards that end.  The bloodstock industry is one of the best we have.  Unless we are prepared to look after these industries and to provide the necessary capital for their development, we cannot expect to hold the place which they are entitled to hold, particularly the industry we are discussing at the moment.  I am, therefore, inclined to agree with Deputy Cosgrave who said this matter should not be looked upon from a parochial viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not merely a matter for the few Deputies who may have a particular interest in racing.  The Deputy from Galway should not deprecate the value of racing in this country because Galway is one of the counties which stand fairly high on the list in so far as gains from that particular industry are concerned.  I do not think that those Deputies who have a particular interest in racing should have a monopoly of the debate here or that they alone should be concerned with this particular matter.  It is a national industry in regard to which we do not intend showing any parochialism.  It is a national industry of importance to every part of the country and it is an industry in respect of which even those of us who have no connection whatever with it have always been proud especially when this country produced horses that were world famous.  We have now taken steps to produce even better horses than ever we did before so that we may be in the forefront in that particular industry and put it on the map. We have taken steps to see that the industry will be a source in future years <Col N="1809" /> of a greater return in so far as it will attract the world's best buyers and the greatest world interest in racing will be focussed on this country.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion and I have no qualms of conscience in that connection.  Unlike the previous speaker, we will go into the Lobby to support it with a free conscience and in the belief that we are supporting a national industry which has been a tradition of pride in this country, a tradition to which we look with confidence in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaint I have to make in regard to the discussion on this matter concerns the unreality of some of the Deputies who advocated this great investment we have made by paying £250,000 for this horse as if there was nothing else in the country upon which it would be worth while spending ten times that amount.  I have heard Deputies on both sides of the House say it was a sound investment. I hope the last Deputy and other Deputies will not accuse me of parochialism.  I claim to have as much interest in the National Stud as any Deputy but I would like the people who are in charge of the National Stud to be men of national outlook.  That is very little thought of at the moment.</P>
      <P>I must refer to the fantastic price paid for the horse while nothing was done by any Deputy in regard to the unemployed when there was a motion put down from these benches.  There are 89,000 people registered at the Labour Exchange at the moment and if these were put to work at £5 per week &mdash;a small amount in these days&mdash;they would produce per year over £23,229,000 worth of goods and services.  Were we to pay those 89,000 people only £4 per week we would produce goods and services to the value of over £19,000,000. Does anybody suggest that we should sit quietly and silently listening to a proposal to spend £250,000 on a horse which might prove as barren as anything we could think of?  Surely we must have some sense of reality in discussions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the great excitement among Deputies on the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Benches in regard <Col N="1810" /> to the great investment we have made in buying this horse.  I could say a lot more about this matter, but I will not do so.  I understand there is a very heavy insurance on this horse. I would like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary would have any information in regard to the amount of insurance to be paid on this horse this year.  I am informed that there is anything up to £9,000 insurance on that horse per year.  I suggest to Deputies on both sides of the House who spoke about this great investment that the State should carry that insurance and not hand it over to any combine or combines which are paralysing progress in this country.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary answer that question now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the insurance will be carried by the State.  I do not want to waste another five minutes on this discussion because the matter was debated at length.  I am registering my protest at the manner in which this business was done while there are so many other worth-while projects in which we could invest our money better.</P>
      <P>Some American advisers told us that we were paying £8,000,000 freightage on goods coming into and leaving the country, but when we suggested that we should spend £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 on better ships we were told it could not be done.  When I suggested that we should increase the old age pension &mdash;the old age pensioner is expected to live on 21s. 6d. per week&mdash;we were told that there was no money available. While we are discussing this horse there are many other things from the human aspect in which we could invest our money.  I am protesting against this purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We come to this House for £250,000 for the National Stud because of the purchase of Tulyar and anything the Minister may say that it was to be employed otherwise will not carry much weight. It is occasioned by the purchase of the horse called Tulyar.  There is no doubt <Col N="1811" /> about that.  It is something we cannot defer.  We have got to face up to it. It comes at a time which is unfortunate for the people of the country in so far as there is so much unemployment and so much emigration.  There are also other and greater problems facing the country.  We are now presented with a problem to solve.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that in the course of the last 12 months we remitted enough money which would go a considerable way towards purchasing this horse. The purchase price of the horse has been described as astronomical.  Other expressions were used to describe the purchase price in order to try and convey the immensity of the figure.  I understand there is a feeling among people who are in a position to give expression to what they considered should be the price of the animal that the price was rather too high.</P>
      <P>However, that is over and done with now and we are merely discussing whether it should have been done or not.  Over the past year we, by vote of the House, gave £140,000 to the dance-hall proprietors.  If we had that sum in the coming year it would pay for Tulyar and would be a good capital investment.  However, we gave that back and the taxpayers, through the Office of the Minister for Finance, must find this £250,000.  We Deputies are sent to this House to represent the views of our constituents and were we to take any line other than the views which they express in this matter, then we would not be keeping faith with them.  It is for that reason that I oppose the payment of this price for Tulyar.  Many views have been put forward in support of it.  It is conceded that the best views in support of the purchase have come from my own Party.  Nevertheless, some of us feel that there are other uses to which this money could be put and which would bring a better return to the country.</P>
      <P>The staying power of the horse was referred to.  It would appear also, whatever about the estimate of the staying power of Tulyar, that the staying power of the ratepayers is overrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> The Minister gave some figures about the employment being given in this industry.  I think the comparison he drew was not a fair one.  He said that in horse breeding there was one man employed to 20 acres, whereas there was only one man to 42 acres in the rest of the country.  We have an idea of the type of land on which horse breeding is carried on, and we in the dairying area know that if we had such land we could give employment to many more than one man to 20 acres.  The rate one to 42 acres applies to every type of land throughout the country&mdash;mountain and bog land and everything else.  That was not a fair comparison.</P>
    <P>We think that this purchase does not dovetail into the present situation. Speaking for my own constituency, when this came up on a former occasion the Minister for Agriculture interrupted me and said it would bring considerable benefit to my constituency. We have as great a love for the horse as there is in any other constituency in Ireland.  I made some inquiries; I asked my constituency executive how many breeders in my constituency would benefit from the purchase of this animal, how many there were who could afford the service charged for Tulyar.  I was told there was one, a non-national.  That occurs in the very month when the Cork Committee of Agriculture have to cut their suit according to their measure and cut down the number of premiums for bulls, while another section of the industry had to be deprived of monetary assistance, as it is felt that the people could not afford to pay anything more in support of it. This comes at a time when people are hard put to meet many other commitments, and it is in that light we must look at it.</P>
    <P>It would have been better if, in his introduction, the Minister had not sought to convey that a distinct favour was being conferred on this country by the vendor of the animal in not parting with him for a higher price to the Americans.  Surely it was a consideration that the vendor will continue to enjoy the service of this sire for his own string?  It would have <Col N="1813" /> been better if the Minister had outlined once and for all at the commencement of the discussion the number of priorities which the former owner of the animal will continue to have in his service.</P>
    <P>The debate has gone on now for long enough and much has been said, but I feel, in justice to my constituency and without taking up in any way a parochial attitude.  I must say that if we were all to come before this House with the same high level of advocacy, there are other sections in live-stock production which could come forward with a better case to get a larger sum from the Exchequer for a purpose which would bring to this country higher employment and better conditions for those engaged in it than can be given in this measure.</P>
    <P>We must, however, have regard to what was stated here.  There was one point brought forward by Deputy Dillon which registered definitely on my mind, the fact that nothing but the best was good enough for our National Stud.  It is to be noted that the country could well stand up to this piece of capital investment if such havoc had not been created with our resources in the last 18 months.  It is facing up to reality when I say that in one town in my constituency there are 400 men at the labour exchange and one mile away there is one non-national benefiting from this measure, who I do not think will employ one additional person as a result.  It is facing up to that situation that I am constrained to vote against this Bill.</P>

I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Donnell condemn race meetings of all kinds.  I do not know what has come over him. He used to enjoy the sport very much, and it is a sport which most people enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come down to the sense of reality to which Deputy Hickey referred, I would like to point out that we are as much concerned about the people involved <Col N="1814" /> in racing as is any member of the Labour Party.  Whether a man is a jockey, a stable lad or a general farm hand round a stud farm, he is just as important as an attendant in a theatre and has the same right to get a decent wage.  I wonder if the critics of this purchase ever consider the number of men employed in the stables, on the racecourses and in the book-making industry all over the country.  If we let our bloodstock go down and it becomes not worth while improving the strain, as has been done since the National Stud was set up, these people will eventually lose their employment and the high reputation of our horses all over the world will cease and nobody will be attracted here to purchase them.</P>
    <P>We have this talk of £250,000.  Every spring and every autumn into this city is brought more than £250,000 from visitors, who spend it in the hotels and shops, because of the attraction of Ballsbridge&mdash;and the foundation of that attraction is the live-stock industry. Here you have a further attempt to improve it and, incidentally, to improve our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Deputy from Galway talking as he did about horse racing.  A considerable asset to the City of Galway is the Galway races, which are known all over the world.  The Galway Blazers have a fine reputation, and hunters are bought from County Galway by Australia, South Africa and other places.</P>
    <P>We have heard this small talk about only one man being able to afford the service of Tulyar, but what is going on on the other side?  Every brood mare or good sire you bring into the country builds up the value of our live stock.  This purchase is a step in that direction.  Therefore, as regards the sense of reality, we are keeping thousands of people in employment by this purchase, with a wage bill of some millions.</P>
    <P>In my constituency&mdash;which I am primarily concerned with&mdash;if you take away the race meetings from Mullingar you hit the hotels and the racecourse.</P>

      <P>Then you have places in the West like Ballinrobe and Tuam, which have racecourses; you have the racing stables in the Midlands in County Meath; and you have the ordinary point-to-point held outside a country town.  Does this not bring in hundreds of pounds to a town?  Is it not an asset?  All these things are mixed up with our racehorses and bloodstock and everything this House can do to improve the strain is to the good.</P>
      <P>I resent very much Deputy Hickey's reference to the people in charge of the National Stud and his suggestion that they have not got a national outlook.  We, who know some of them, know that they have a big national reputation and that some of them fought for the independence of this country.  It is a most unfair criticism on his part.  I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill.  I do not think it is a Bill which should be made a political issue, and, if it is made a political issue, even in a by-election, it will not get one vote.</P>

      <P>This Bill has for its purpose the provision of £250,000 for the National Stud, but, no matter what the Minister may say, it is patently obvious to everybody that the purpose of providing the money is the purchase of a horse called Tulyar.  I will admit, as I think everybody who has any connection with or knowledge of racing will admit, that Tulyar is possibly one of the best horses of the century.  He has done practically everything which is conceivably possible for a horse of classic calibre to do, but that does not seem to me to be the only issue in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sat through the greater part <Col N="1816" /> of this debate and listened to the arguments for and against.  The arguments against are innumerable.  I should like to deal for a moment with the arguments adduced in favour of this purchase.  The Parliamentary Secretary has voiced the opinion of most of the speakers on the Fianna Fáil Benches that anyone who opposes the spending of £250,000 on the purchase of a single racehorse&mdash;let Deputies mark this, that this is the greatest sum of money ever paid for a horse in the history of racing in the world&mdash;is small-minded. Furthermore, the argument has been put forward from the benches opposite &mdash;perhaps I am wrong, but this is what I have gathered from listening to them &mdash;that if we do not buy this horse, we are going to smash the tourist industry and the racing industry.  Is that, in effect, not what the Parliamentary Secretary and the Deputy from Donegal who spoke before him said? If we do not buy Tulyar, all these dreadful things are going to happen. I think they are paying a very poor compliment to Irish racing bloodstock. Let me say here and now that, as an Irishman and as representing a constituency that has bred fine horses&mdash; hunters, steeplechasers and classic horses&mdash;down the years, I am proud of our horse tradition and I hold the view that the National Stud has not reached such a stage that it is going to be totally destroyed unless we spend £250,000 on Tulyar.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted by Deputies opposite, and particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary, that this is a gamble.  Admittedly, practically anything to do with racing is a gamble, but are we justified, no matter what our own personal sentiments with regard to racing may be, as elected representatives of the people, in gambling with their money to the tune of £250,000, in view of the state of the country and the world to-day?  Not only that, but are we justified in doing that at any time?  I ask Deputies to ponder on that before they march into the Division Lobby to vote for the spending of this big sum.  There are a considerable number of other angles to be looked at.  If somebody has a sum of £10,000 to invest&mdash;the capital sum <Col N="1817" /> associated with the National Stud is £500,000 and the sum to be expended on a single unit, £250,000&mdash;will that person to-day, financier or businessman, invest 50 per cent., or £5,000, of that sum in a single investment?  I do not believe he will.  I do not believe in having all our eggs in one basket.</P>
    <P>To go further, the purpose for which Tulyar is being bought is the rearing of bloodstock.  This horse is untried as a sire, and it is conceivably possible that he may be sterile.  Where do we come in then?  I will probably be answered by the statement that we would carry insurance to cover that, which brings us to the other angle of the proposition.  The Minister has said that it is estimated that this great horse has a probable period of 12 years at stud, and everybody will agree that that is a pretty fair statement.  That means that, in the first year, there will be about 20 mares&mdash;subsequently he may have more&mdash;and he may be able to produce about £20,000 per year, but to get that money involves the carrying of a very heavy insurance.  We have not been given any information by the Minister on that point.  He has told us that it is a matter for the National Stud, but we are handing over this sum of £250,000 without getting any details.  The cost of that insurance has been estimated at about £9,000, and it will probably be something in the region of that figure, which is going to leave us about £7,000 profit from this horse in a full year.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that the progeny of the horse will pay for everything, but there are several angles from which that can be looked at as well.  It has been stated, and so far has not been denied by those in a position to know, that the previous owner of the horse has the right to four nominations.  I presume one of the main objects at the back of the minds of those who instigated the purchase of this horse was the securing of dollars.  Why should not the potentate who has sold this horse sell the progeny of his four mares, as he probably may, outside this country and pay in the cheque he receives to an English bank?  Where is the revenue to the Irish nation then? <Col N="1818" /> It has been argued that, if we do not buy this horse, people will not come to the horse show to buy our progeny, but I have seen them coming in the spring and the autumn for years and they will continue to come, whether we buy Tulyar or not.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are not really in touch with realities.  If they were, they would not be so vociferous in their support of this transaction.  I have said already that I am proud, as every Deputy is, of our reputation as a horse-breeding nation.  Reference has been made to the vast number of unemployed, and I am sorry for the unemployed, just the same as everybody else is.  I think it is a national tragedy that we should have them. But the unemployed are not the only persons who are concerned about the purchase of this horse.  The majority of the people of this country think that it is politics gone stark raving mad to invest this sum of money in the purchase of the horse.  I do not think it is justified under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the United States of America, a wealthy nation and the most powerful nation in the world, were prepared to give £321,000 for the horse but that we were allowed to purchase it on account of the owner's love for the Irish nation.  I think that is very hard to swallow. Anybody who has anything to do with horse breeding knows well that you do not meet many philanthropists when you are trying to buy a horse.  I feel that this purchase is unjustified. Surely there is another horse of good classic standard to be got somewhere. This is an unproven and untried sire. It is quite possible to buy a horse at a price more in keeping with the circumstances that prevail in Ireland to-day.</P>
    <P>I think that the purchase of this horse for a sum of £250,000 is an unwarranted foolishness and I do not feel justified in voting for it.  I know that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party will troop into the Lobby and vote for it; I cannot blame them for doing so because they are tied and have to do it.  In a case like this, <Col N="1819" /> however, I think the Government should leave the matter to a free vote and give everybody a chance of voting according to the dictates of his conscience. For my part, I am absolutely satisfied that I will be doing the right thing by my constituents and by the Irish people when I vote against this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As an ordinary worker in a small town where there are 400 on the unemployed register, and with 200 road and quarry workers out of employment, I want to signify my protest at the purchase of this animal at the price which has been paid for it. At a time when the housing drive is slowing up and when more and more people are losing their employment I feel that I would not adequately be representing my constituents if I did not voice my opinion on the matter of the purchase of this horse.  The horse may be all right but the price to the Irish people is all wrong.  That is the position.</P>
      <P>One of the English newspapers states to-day that Tulyar is worth his weight in gold.  If that is so, why is it that Britain did not purchase him&mdash;a nation which is richer than this nation?  We remember only too well the speech which the Minister for Finance made in this House on the last Budget.  We know only too well the effect which the partial removal of the subsidies on food has had on many homes throughout the country.  There has been an increase in the purchase price of the loaf of bread, in tea, sugar, cigarettes, tobacco, beer and spirits.  The Government sought to obtain money even from the poorest section of the community and yet, just a few months after the Budget, they can come along and negotiate for the purchase of this horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Aga Khan announced three weeks ago that the Irish Stud had purchased this horse.  This House was not told about the negotiations.  The Minister comes along now and asks his own Party and members of other Parties to vote £250,000 for the purchase of Tulyar.  Of course, the Minister boosted up the animal's value. <Col N="1820" /> I have here a racing and breeding paper dated February 14th.  In that paper, I read that the cost of Tulyar is £250,000, that insurance at 4 per cent, will cost £10,000, that interest on capital at 5 per cent, will amount to £12,500 and that the expense of keeping the animal will amount to £500.  I suppose all the expenditure does not end there.  These figures may seem all right to people who are making plenty of money&mdash;the well-to-do people who go to Punchestown, Fairyhouse and other racecourses and pay £1 admission. Last night we heard a Deputy talking about all the working-class people who go to races.</P>
    <P>If a working-class person goes to a race meeting there is a hell of a difference between him and the well-to-do person.  He pays 2/6 while the well-to-do person pays £1.  He is not let near the paddock unless he pays 15/- or £1: otherwise he must stand outside on the ditch away altogether from the big grand stands.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have 85,000 registered unemployed and there are many more of our people on home assistance.  The present Government is being kept in office by three or four Independents.</P>
    <P>Such a Government has no mandate from the people to come to this House now and, in the existing serious unemployment situation, ask the House to vote this large sum of money for the purchase of Tulyar.  We do not forget that not very long ago various Ministers of the present Government went throughout the country making speeches on our serious economic position. We do not forget that they told the people that the Coalition Government had broken the country and that the sooner Fianna Fáil were returned to office the better it would be for all concerned.  I wonder what the ordinary man in the street thinks now when he remembers all those speeches by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Every person in my constituency whom I met this morning told me to be sure and cast my vote against the purchase of this animal at such a high cost from the Aga Khan.  The Aga Khan is a millionaire.  If he were interested in Irish racing he could have kept Tulyar <Col N="1821" /> at his stud in County Kildare.  If he were interested in the farmers of Ireland he could have kept Tulyar at that stud and charged a fee.</P>

I must say that I was surprised to hear Government Deputies defend the purchase of this animal at the price which was paid for it.  As a Deputy remarked here last night, what about all the fine horses which we had for escorting the President of this country and for the purchase of which this House voted money?  They were all scrapped and replaced by British-made motor-cycles run on Russian oil.  Just think of that. Then we hear talk about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that in the present circumstances of grave unemployment, emigration, restriction of credit and of housing grants, and with a cut of over £250,000 in the vote for the forestry section, the purchase of this horse by the Government at a price of £250,000 cannot be justified.  Thousands of people in Dublin City and elsewhere are clamouring for a day's work.  In my own little town of a population of 6,000, there are 400 registered unemployed. Inside two weeks or, at the most, two months there will be another 100 unemployed there because the housing scheme is finishing and we cannot get sanction from the Minister for Local Government to proceed further.  For these reasons, I stand up here and voice the wishes of the people who sent me here to represent them.  After all the talk by members of the Fianna Fáil Party during the general election and at the by-elections about the serious economic state of the country, the people are horrified now at the expenditure of this large sum of money on the purchase of this horse. We are giving the Aga Khan £250,000 and we gave the dance-hall proprietors £140,000.</P>
      <P>I do not know how any representative of the people in the Fianna Fáil Party can justify voting for this measure.  I wish they were allowed to come in here and speak their minds on this matter as freely as I am speaking my mind.  I regret that they must follow the Party line.  They were not sent in here by the people to do everything that the Taoiseach does.  He can make mistakes just like anybody else: so can the Minister for Agriculture and so can the National Stud.</P>
      <P>Everyone makes mistakes.  This House should have been notified that this purchase was going to be made. The farmers went on strike the other day because of the price they are getting for milk.  The Government gave them nothing, and they gave nothing to the civil servants.</P>

      <P>The working classes are the people who suffer through the action of the Fianna Fáil Government. The have been suffering since they got back into power.  They sold the agricultural machinery and that caused unemployment in the rural areas.  I do not blame the Minister.  He probably has no say in this except to come into the House and make a case for it.  We have people, too, on the Fine Gael side. I do not agree with their leader on this.  I like to be consistent.  They voted against the airplanes.  Let them vote now against the purchase of this horse, and, as a Party, be consistent. To my mind, since this Government came back, the country has gone back into the old grooves of unemployment and emigration.  During the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government, a man could go into the room of the Taoiseach and tell him what he thought and what the people thought. It is not the same with the Fianna Fáil Government.  In the time of the inter-Party Government, Deputy Cogan wanted to get better prices for the farmers, but to-day he is saying nothing.</P>

      <P>But he is going to vote £250,000 to the Aga Khan, and during the milk strike he said nothing on behalf of the farmers when they were looking for an increase in the price of milk.  This is a very small country, with only 26 counties.  The people are expected to buy Constellations, racehorses and to carry C.I.E. on their backs.  The last payment it got was £1,500,000.  Yet, money cannot be found to provide subsidies to keep down the price of the necessaries of life for the people.  That is why I am going to vote with the Labour Party and to support Deputy Dunne in this. <Col N="1824" /> It is outrageous to be told that there is no money for anything.  The Estimates have been cut down, and we are told that there is no money for the national teachers, the Civic Guards or the civil servants.  At the same time we are able to find £250,000 to give to the richest man in the world for a horse.  A racing paper has this to say about Tulyar: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether Tulyar would in any case be the type of horse the Americans want for their particular sort of racing is beside the point.  This is that the mere fact that such an offer has been made excites in certain other people a desire `not to lose something', which seems to me to cut right across a reasoned purchasing plan.  Whether Tulyar is raced this year or not, such a policy will normally have three results.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Since the days of the late Boss Croker, who caused a furore in royal circles by refusing to accept the personal congratulations of the then reigning monarch in England when his horse Orby won the Derby, I do not think any other horse has caused such a flutter in executive circles in this country as Tulyar.  Now, I do not propose to back this Bill each way. I am, and let me say it at once, completely against the Bill.  I am not going to endeavour to run down the merits of the horse Tulyar.  Neither am I going to criticise the personnel of the executive of the National Stud. What I want to say is that this is not the time, and this is not the year, in which we should invest £250,000 in one horse.  The horse may be the greatest racehorse which this century has seen. His progeny may prove to be the greatest that this country has ever seen, but remember, as someone has said, he is an Irish-bred horse.  Why may we not hope to produce another Tulyar next year or the year after? Where have the sire and the dam of this horse gone to?  It may be that their next foal may be equally as good. As I say, this is not the time in which to invest £250,000 in a horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste on many occasions within the past 18 months have told us that the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank and the advisers of the Department of Finance are continually showing the red light that we are spending <Col N="1826" /> too much.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Fisheries told us that he agrees that he is not getting a fair allocation of money for the expansion of our fisheries.  The same may be said about forestry.  To put more money into both our fisheries and our forestry would be a good capital investment.  It would be of much more importance to the country than to spend £250,000 on the purchase of one horse.  If our fisheries were flourishing, if our forestry were in the flourishing condition in which we would desire it to be, if our tourist roads were 100 per cent. fit to carry the tourist traffic we expect, if we were living in Utopia, then I would say, by all means, invest £250,000 in this gamble on a good horse which may prove to be anything but a good sire.</P>
    <P>We have been told that a considerable amount of money is brought into this country by tourists who attend race meetings and sales and shows at Ballsbridge.  I quite agree.  We want to see tourists spending their money in seeing the tourist sights of rural Ireland.  We do not want them to spend their money in the luxury hotels for the plutocrats in the City of Dublin.  We want to see them in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, down the western seaboard, in what are called the undeveloped areas.  That is where we want to see them.</P>
    <P>I was more than surprised to hear my friend and colleague from West Donegal, Deputy Brennan, supporting this Bill.  If we could get one fraction of the price of even a horseshoe of Tulyar for the development of our tourist industry in West Donegal we would be doing much better, and I would have pleasure in supporting any Bill promoted by a Minister for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that it is quite clear that this Bill has done: it has killed for all time the dishonest political campaign which the Minister for Finance has been carrying on since 19th July, 1951.  Deputies will remember that on that day the present Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, came into this House and made his first speech after being appointed Minister and started then <Col N="1827" /> the wail of woe that the country was broke, that it was bankrupt, that there was no money for anything.  The introduction of this Bill, the approval of this purchase by the Government, has put paid to that dishonest campaign that was initiated by the present Minister for Finance.  If it does nothing else, I hope it will end that type of dishonesty which has become so nauseating from the Minister for Finance, particularly in the past six months.</P>
      <P>Last night, the Minister for Agriculture said that a great deal of the criticism in regard to Tulyar was ill-informed. I agree with him that a great deal of the criticism is uninformed and the person I blame for that is the Minister.  The Minister, with a singular lack of efficiency, with that display of cuteness to which we have become so accustomed when he wants to hide something, endeavoured to give the impression when this matter was first raised that there was a good deal more behind it than, in fact, there really is.  The Minister should apologise very profusely to those people who are responsible for running the National Stud for the hash that he has made of the propaganda case for the purchase of this horse.</P>
      <P>He should make it quite clear, even at this late stage, that there is a case that could be made on the merits and a case which they, as servants of the Government, are unable, because of their position, to make for themselves. For some reason best known to himself, he has tried to shroud the whole question of this purchase in mystery, instead of being frank with the House and the public.  If he had been frank, honest and honourable with the House and the public there would not have been any of the uninformed criticism that there has been about the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister got an opportunity, when Deputy Dunne raised this question on the Adjournment some time ago, of dispelling the rumours that are current everywhere.  He chose to be cheap and to sneer instead of doing his job as Minister and bringing the facts out to the public.  If there has been <Col N="1828" /> criticism that was not informed there is one person who is responsible for that: that is the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think the price that is being paid for Tulyar is much too high but I do not hold myself out in any way as an expert on breeding.  For all I know, it may be that for the 11 mares that are at the National Stud it was absolutely essential to get a certain line of blood to cross and to mate with them and that the only line of blood that would suit them, to build up the proper foundation of mares for that stud, was the Tulyar line.  If that is so&mdash;and I have heard people suggest that it is&mdash;it would be one reason which could be put forward in respect of this purchase.</P>
    <P>We have had no indication from the Minister as to whether the primary purpose was to buy this sire as an investment for the build-up of the stud, as an investment for the build-up of the national thoroughbred stock or as an investment from a monetary angle. Personally, I think we may rule out the last alternative completely.  There is no possibility that I can see of Tulyar being an investment in the ordinary sense, in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    <P>When we took over the National Stud in 1945 we were given a piece of land that had a great reputation as being some of the best land in the world on which to breed bloodstock. We were given no foundation mares, no bloodstock with which to start breeding.  It is inevitable, therefore, that the build-up of the stock in order to make that stud a success in the national interest is a thing that will take considerable time and that will be done by investment in bloodstock that will not show a return in the ordinary monetary sense.</P>
    <P>One must take a long-term view of the matter.  Personally I think that if we were spending £250,000 on the purchase of bloodstock it should have been possible to get what was required, not perhaps quite at the top flight, for a very substantially less sum.  One of the things that worries me about this purchase is that, obviously, for a horse like this, you must select the 40 best mares available to send to him <Col N="1829" /> because, if you do not, you will not build up his reputation as a sire.  You must first of all, particularly in the early years, send only the very best mares to him in the hope that these mares will bring foals that, in their two-year-old season as racehorses, will be successful and will therefore establish at an early date the success of the horse as a sire.</P>
    <P>I wonder what proportion of the 40 mares in question that are the best and most suitable to be sent to this horse are mares that we can say with confidence will always be left here, that we can say with confidence the produce of the sales of their progeny is money that will come into this country and be retained in this country.  I am afraid it is a very small proportion. That is why I suggest that the National Stud would be doing a better service, perhaps, in raising the general level of thorough-breeding rather than in aiming at raising the very topmost level for mares that may quite easily be taken away in time and brought back to their country of true ownership.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the purchase of this horse will bring a substantial amount of prestige.  I am not at all so sure, however, that if Tulyar had been sold to America the fact that it was born and bred here might not earn even a better prestige for Irish horses in America.  It might be a better advertisement if he were over there as a sire rather than here.  It has been suggested, however, by people who know far more about this than I do, that no sire will ever be successful in the American climate in the same way as it would be successful in this climate. So far as I am concerned, I feel that I must rely for judgment in this matter on the people whom I believe are experts at their job.  They were undoubtedly the authorised agents of the Irish people and as such were entitled to make the contract they did make. We cannot turn around now, as they were authorised in that respect, and tell them that on behalf of the Irish people we propose to welsh on a contract duly and validly made.  For that reason, if for no other, I personally feel constrained to support the proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> I want to say, however, that the one person responsible for most of the difficulty in regard to this transaction is the Minister for Agriculture.  If he had come out openly and said that it was the normal practice for nominations to be reserved on the sale of a stallion, and that so many nominations were reserved to the vendor on this occasion, and that these nominations were to be paid for at the ruling price, then we would not have had the mad rumours which were careering through the country that ten nominations were to be given free to the Aga Khan as a result of this transaction.</P>
    <P>The only reason these rumours gained currency was because the Minister was not frank in stating what the position was.  If the Minister had come out frankly and said what was the position, whether this horse was to be raced in the current season or not, it would be far easier to kill and scotch the rumours that were going round.  We do not yet know whether it is proposed to race the horse in the coming season.  The only thing we do know in that respect is that he will not be raced in the Derby.  But, personally, I think it would be a mad gamble for the State to permit this horse, no matter what money might be involved, to race this year.  We would be asking for trouble.  One defeat and the horse might be easily worth very considerably less afterwards.</P>
    <P>Let us face the issue that, frankly, this is not an investment in the ordinary sense of the term.  I believe, and I have said so during the past one and a half years, that for anything worthwhile there is ample money in the State to do it.  We have impressed that time and time again upon the Minister for Finance and it is only that Minister's foolish outlook that says the contrary.  There are adequate funds in the country to meet the purchase of this horse and for doing all the things which are worthwhile.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that the question of building up the National Stud from a long-term point of view should be approached, the benefit that there will be to breeding as a whole and the export to the dollar area.  A sum of <Col N="1831" /> £250,000 is a very small amount in export at present.  The figures show that the export of thorough breds to the dollar countries is about the only thing that shows an immediate prospect of a reasonable increase in our trade.  Those things can be done.  But let us be frank and let us get rid of the hugger-mugger fostered by the Minister about it.  Let us have the facts put on the table.  Let us have put on record in this House what is intended to be done about the people's property.  It is no good for the Minister to shelter behind others and say this is not his decision, that it is a matter for the directors.  This is the people's property and, no matter by whom the decision is taken, the people have a right to be told what the position is and be able to judge on the true facts when they are properly presented.</P>

      <P>As a dairy and tillage farmer, I wish to protest against the purchase of this horse.  I consider the price is out of all keeping with an agricultural country such as this is, especially at a time when the financial position is not on a very sound footing and when the number of unemployed his risen to 90,000.  Apparently it is very hard on the Minister for Agriculture to grant an increase of 3d. or 4d. to the sorely-tried dairy farmers who are the heart and soul and life-blood of the nation at a time when the cost of production has gone up immensely, and it has gone up immensely within the past two years.  I consider it is very unwise of the Minister to pay out £250,000, as well as the cost of insurance, etc., at a time when we are told by the Minister for Finance that we are on the verge of bankruptey.</P>

We have heard a good deal about the employment which will <Col N="1832" /> be given.  What will it be in comparison to the amount of employment that dairying and tillage are giving?  I think it is quite unreasonable to pay £250,000 for a sire that is unproved at the stud.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that poor Tulyar has been ridden almost to death in this House during the past two days. Now that we are on the straight for home I suppose I can afford to take it easy, because as far as the discussion has gone no argument has been put forward in support of the rejection of this measure which is to increase the capital of the National Stud.  There has been a lot of unreality in this discussion.  We are not asking for money to buy Tulyar.  We are asking this House to increase the capital of the National Stud.  That is what I brought this Bill in for.</P>

      <P>The people who have been opposed to building up this industry have come along and made this a crossroads debate.  They have been using this House for propaganda purposes and for nothing else.  You have not faced the realities and you know that.  What have all the other projects that we have in the country to do with the building up of the National Stud?</P>
      <P>There are several other branches of agriculture that Agriculture has to be responsible for.  Am I to go over the list of the various branches that I have to provide money for from year to year and from month to month? During the past 20 years, for instance, the live-stock industry has been built up by way of subsidies, by way of premiums and so forth to the extent of £2,000,000.  Deputy Dillon expended a sum of £360,000 on machinery to reclaim the land of the country.  These matters have been approved of by the House.  There has been no objection to them.  But when I come along to look for money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no use in drawing red herrings about Tulyar into this discussion. I have mentioned that many things had to be done there.  For years, or for some time past&mdash;I think Deputy Dillon will agree with me&mdash;the directors of the National Stud have been trying to get a long-distance horse to put to stud.  They have not succeeded in getting him over the past two or three years, and even if they did get him at any time within that period it would have been necessary for Deputy Dillon, if he was Minister for Agriculture, to come before the House for an increase in capital because they had not sufficient money to purchase a horse.  The same applies as far as mares are concerned.  They are bringing some high-class mares there still in order to equip the stud as it should be equipped.  Deputy Dillon hit the right note when he said this is a National Stud.</P>

      <P>If you are going to starve it, get rid of it.  Let it be one way or the other.  What do Deputies want?  Do you want to starve it?  Do you want to make it a second-rate or third-rate stud?  Is that your conception of what a National Stud should be?  I believe this country, small as it is, with its reputation for horseflesh, is entitled to the best and to nothing less than the best.  We are entitled to have here as good a National Stud as they have in England or America, and it is for that reason I believe the House should have no hesitation in giving this capital to the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directors have gone into the market for stallions.  They have been responsible for the purchase of Royal <Col N="1834" /> Charger.  He is a credit to the country, to the people who bought him, and his progeny have been a credit to the country.  I mentioned also in my opening speech that we have a certain sum of money there of unexpended capital. It is not sufficient to buy Tulyar.  It is not even sufficient to buy the mares we want.  It is necessary, for the purpose of buying more mares and buying this sire, to increase that capital to £500,000.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my opening speech, we have the climate and the soil and the skill but we have not the breeding to put our bloodstock where it should be put.  I do believe that in the purchase of Tulyar the people who are directly responsible for building up the National Stud have taken the right step and one that I heartily approve of.  This horse has been proved on the racecourse to be the best in the world and I have proof of that in the letters and testimonials that I have had from a number of people.  I would like to quote one.  I am sure his name is well known in this country.  He wired to me and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Congratulations on the purchase of Tulyar for Ireland.  He is the best horse in the world from five furlongs to five miles and will increase the value of Irish bloodstock to the extent of many millions of pounds.</P>

Deputy Dillon stated that if we are to have a stud let it be the best. I agree with him on that.  Some other Deputy stated there were certain nominations being given away in the purchase.  I am not directly responsible for this purchase.  Neither is the Government. The people directly responsible for the purchase are the directors. Any information I have or give the House, it is through the directors I am giving it.  I am not too sure whether they are under any obligation to me or the House to give the information I am going to give you now.  They are charged with the responsibility of running it and ours is to provide the money to run it.  Have you confidence in them?  If you have not confidence in them to provide the money that this House votes, then you have your remedy and your remedy is to get rid of them.

      <P>He has the best mares in the world and it is an advantage to have his mares coming to the National Stud because it ensures that the mares sired by Tulyar will be, if not the best, equal to the best there is in the world and the progeny of these mares will be first-rate and top rank.  Is it not a good thing we have them?  I think any stud owner would be delighted if he had an assurance when he was putting his horse to stud that he had four mares of the type and quality that the Aga Khan has.  I think he would be delighted with himself, and not merely have four from him but from three or four others in the same way.  It is a good thing to have them and for that reason I believe that the National Stud is very lucky that the Aga Khan has asked for four nominations and will get them.  Deputy Dunne seemed to be under the impression that there was a lot of bluffing going on regarding the purchase of this horse.

      <P>The following is the quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The year 1951 saw the emergence of the first $1,000,000-winner on the racecourse.  The year 1953 may become notable for the first sale of a racehorse for $1,000,000.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Cooper Persons, mistress of Llangollen Farms at Upperville, Vancouver, has obtained from the Aga Khan an agreement to sell Tulyar unbeaten as a three-year-old in England in 1952, and is organising a syndicate to bring the colt to the United States.  At the rate of $33,000 a share, a total of about $750,000 already has been subscribed, mostly by Eastern breeders, Mrs. Persons told <i>The Blood-Horse</i> this week.</P>
      <P>Actually, since the Aga Khan has indicated he would like to breed about half a dozen of his own mares to the horse, the cash transaction would be something less than $1,000,000, but if the sale is made the price, however estimated, will be the highest ever for a thoroughbred horse.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the purchase, Mrs. Persons said, are `almost complete'. She expected to be able to make a more definite announcement within the next two or three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tulyar, a brown colt by the wartime St. Leger winner, Tehran, out of the high-class Neocracy, by Nearco out of Trigo's high-class sister, Harina, by Blandford, has been kept in training under the <Col N="1838" /> direction of Marcus Marsh, with the expectation that he would run in this year's Ascot Gold Cup, possibly the Prix de Triomphe, and other important races.  If he comes to the United States, the question as to whether he races here will be left to the decision of the shareholders, Mrs. Persons said.</P>
    <P>The decision as to where he will stand if he enters the stud in America has already been made.  `He will be right here at Llangollen,' Mrs. Persons stated.</P>
    <P>In English papers the Aga Khan has been quoted as denying that he is selling Tulyar at the reported offer of $1,000,000.  He was roundly scolded in the English Press for selling Blenheim II, Mahmoud, and Bahram to buyers in the United States, and probably would come in for a still more thorough shellacking if he sold Tulyar.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Persons, however, says that the deal now awaits only the completion of the syndicate.  She expects to go to Europe, if necessary, to complete the negotiation, and incidentally to see the yearlings she has sent there to be trained and the mares for which she has engaged seasons to Tehran, Tabriz, Palestrine, and other stallions.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Deputies here tried to spoil it before I came in.  The case can stand on its own ground.  I want to try to give explanations for the things that have been said, and prove to this House that there has been no question of bluffing. That is what I want to get on record. We have not been bluffed nor have the directors been bluffed into buying this horse.  It is an acquisition and as I stated yesterday in reply to some of the questions that were put to me across the House it is a national investment and it should be termed as such.  We take the first crop of foals or yearlings from Tulyar and, assuming the same system prevails in his case as prevailed in the case of Royal Charger, where 25 per cent. were selected and 75 per cent. balloted for, we can assume that at least 75 per cent. of his crop will remain here.  Even taking the first year, my argument is this, that the progeny of Tulyar are worth £2,000 more per yearling than that of any other horse we could buy.  We could buy a horse for £160,000.  Let us assume its progeny averaged £3,000.  I claim that the progeny of Tulyar are value for £2,000 more than the progeny of that horse.  That in itself is £30,000 coming into the country or the equivalent in dollars.  If the Americans who seemed to be very anxious to purchase this horse are so fond of him they will come and buy his progeny.  But let us assume it is even sterling that comes in here. It is £30,000 coming into this country, not, as Deputy Murphy said, into the pockets of some of the people who are engaged in racing.  It is coming into the country whoever gets it, whether it is the small breeder or the large breeder.</P>
      <P>It is money coming into the country which reduces the adverse trade balance of the country.  It puts more money in circulation here at home. There is income-tax paid on it, and in that way it is value to the country and everybody gets some value from it, even the people whom Deputy Dunne seemed to be so concerned about last night when he wanted to make a crossroads speech in talking of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In years to come when the value of this horse is known&mdash;and we all hope it will have a successful career&mdash;and that money is coming in here, if it is £100,000 or if it is £60,000, whatever it is, it is a gain not for the individual people who are engaged in racing but for the country as a whole.  That is one thing we seem to forget, that this is a capital investment.  It may be said that there is a gamble in it.  There is a gamble in everything.  The farmer has to gamble in the same way every time he goes to a fair.  Does he not gamble when he sows the seed?  Does he know what type of weather he will get?  Does he know what type of harvest he will have?  Does he know if he will ever reap the corn he has sown?  Some of the Deputies who go to the crossroads to speak at election time think that they have nothing to do but walk in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a bigger gamble the next time.  There will be a bigger risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a gamble.  This may be a gamble in the minds of the people on the opposite benches, but in my opinion it is a sound investment in the bloodstock industry of the country.  No matter what horse you buy he runs the same risks at the stud. If you paid £100,000 he runs the same risks as this horse that cost £250,000.</P>
      <P>It has been demonstrated, I think, by people who have a knowledge of horse-breeding and of the bloodstock industry generally that it was necessary to have a staying horse, a long-distance horse, in this country.  Let us assume that we go out in the morning and pay £100,000 for another horse. Does he not run the same risk as Tulyar?  Why try to magnify the risks that are now being run, as some Deputies try to, when they talk about the colossal price paid for that horse? You are running the same risk with the £100,000 horse as you are with the horse costing £250,000 and, from that point of view, it is a gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put me a question as <Col N="1841" /> to what was my opinion regarding racing this horse this year.  I am not offering any opinion because, if I did, I might in that way prejudice the attitude or the decisions of the people who are responsible for the future of Tulyar.  It is for that reason I am not going to express an opinion.  I hold as strong an opinion as any member in this House, but I am not going to prejudice the decisions or the opinions of the people who will be responsible for the future of the horse at the stud.</P>
    <P>No case has been made for a refusal to increase the capital.  The question at issue here is not whether you are going to buy this horse; it is a question of whether you are going to retain the National Stud or not.  If you decide to retain it, then you must provide the capital.  If you refuse to give them the capital, let there be no equivocation about it, you say we do not want the National Stud.  Remember that this country has always been renowned for the horses it produced, whether as bloodstock, as Army jumpers, or civilian jumpers.  Our horses have brought prestige to the country not merely in the jumping field, or in bloodstock circles but in every army in the world to which we sent troopers and in which our horses were known.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, it has been proved that we have the soil and the climate to produce such horses, and all we want is the breeders.  The directors of the National Stud have gone out to get the breed, and I ask the House to support them by giving them the money they need.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete Section 3, lines 16 to 21, and substitute the following&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  As respects any kind of goods the commission may, on their own <Col N="1847" /> initiative or at the request of an association representing persons engaged in the supply and distribution of such goods, prepare and publish rules representing, in the opinion of the commission, fair trading conditions with regard to the supply and distribution of such goods and, on their own initiative or at the request of an association representing persons rendering, in the course of carrying on any trade or business, any services affecting such supply or distribution, may also prepare and publish rules representing, in the opinion of the commission, fair trading conditions with regard to the rendering of such services.</P>
    <P>(2)  Rules under this section are referred to in this Act as fair trading rules.</P>
    <P>The redrafting of this section arises out of the desire to effect two changes in it.  One is to meet a point raised by Deputy Dockrell in Committee, namely, that the commission should have a discretion as to whether they would prepare fair trading rules or not at the request of an association or body of persons.  As the Bill was framed, the House will remember, they were required to prepare these rules if so requested.  The second change is to carry through here a consequential amendment arising out of the decision to extend the scope of the Bill to include services associated with the distribution of goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment, substituting a new Section 3 for the Section 3 already in the Bill, I want to reiterate a view I mentioned on the Second Stage, that Section 3 should not be here at all.  As I understood the Bill, the purpose was to put an end to restrictive trade practices.  Amendment No. 3, which provides us with a new Section 3, actually requires the commission to become parties to the creation of a code of rules which will enjoy the implied benediction of the Legislature.  Any system of restrictive rules is in itself bad, and the <i>onus probandi</i> of the need for rules of this character must always remain on those <Col N="1848" /> who operate them.  I seriously apprehend that, as a result of this section, instead of our having additional safeguards against restrictive practices, we will have a situation arising in which certain very evil restrictive practices will secure sanction.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the circumstances in which that can, and almost surely will, arise. The vested interests concerned are organised and know what they want. Those who stand in danger of exploitation are not organised and very frequently are wholly untrained to foresee the inevitable consequences of the adoption of a restrictive trade practice. I envisage a situation arising in which a manufacturers' group, the trades union concerned and the distributors interested jointly agree that, if they are all to have the standard that they at present enjoy out of this protected industry, they must combine so that all manufacturers, all distributors and all workers in this protected industry will agree to share the spoils and the only way effectively to do that is to stop competition between themselves. They therefore prepare a draft fair rules for that particular trade and they come before the commission with this case: &ldquo;Everybody concerned in this trade recommends these regulations as being in the best interests of all concerned.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I know the Minister says it is the duty of the commission to constitute itself the protector of the consumer, but suppose these three parties say to the commission: &ldquo;We are bound to advise you that unless a code of this character is introduced, this whole industry may go smash, because the market is limited here and if there is a competition which evokes a supply which exceeds the domestic demand, it will become impossible to maintain labour standards and a reasonable margin of profit to the industry, with the net result that every unit in the industry will collapse and it will not be a case of the most efficient surviving.&rdquo; I know from experience that if a trades union and an industrialist jointly come, even to the Government itself, and say: &ldquo;If you will not provide the quota we want or if you will not jack the tariff up to 75 or 90 per <Col N="1849" /> cent., then the industry will go bang&rdquo;, such a combination presents an almost irresistible influence to get what they want.</P>
    <P>If such a combination as that goes to this commission with that kind of case and they are confronted with the ultimatum: &ldquo;Either you declare under Section 3 that this draft code of rules that we submit on behalf of distributors, producers and employees is fair to the consumer, or we propose to make it known that the collapse of this industry, the unemployment resulting therein and the necessity to import the product that we are producing, is solely and entirely due to the irresponsible conduct of this commission which, all parties notwithstanding, has refused to give us the protection that Section 3 will give us,&rdquo; does the Minister seriously think that the commission will ever take the responsibility of refusing them a code that all parties to the trade or industry combined to say is fair?  The trades union make the case: &ldquo;We are the consumers; we represent the working man; our members are not only engaged in this trade but in a thousand other trades and if anyone were interested we would be interested in keeping costs down.&rdquo;  Do you imagine that this commission can ever find itself in a position of strength to reply: &ldquo;That does not matter; speaking on behalf of that amorphous body, the consumer, we cannot consent to such a code of regulation,&rdquo; the prospect being that they will get no thanks from anybody for their effort to protect the consumer, but run the risk of becoming a public cockshot, if the <i>entrepreneurs</i> refuse to continue operating their activities unless they enjoy the improper protection afforded to them by a code of restrictive regulations which they invite the commission to approve?</P>
    <P>I think you are asking the impossible of a body of this kind in believing they can resist pressure of that kind, and what I apprehend is that, whereas at present, no matter how powerful the influence of such a trinity of interests as I have described may be, they have nowhere to go to get antecedent approval of their activities, and have <Col N="1850" /> to chance their arm, in the knowledge that, if they become too arrogant in their activities, somebody may move the Department to proceed against them, hereafter they can chance their arm as far as they can possibly go before the commission.  Under Section 3 they can afford to retreat a good deal from their first claim before the commission, but they can go much farther than they would dare to go in the ordinary course of conduct, and if they can bamboozle, intimidate, persuade or in any other way get the approbation of the commission for their proposition, no matter how extravagant it appears thereafter to be in practice, they have always the alibi that they can say to the Minister.  &ldquo;Do not ask us; we had all this before the commission, before we put this code of fair trading regulations into operation and they approved it.  If it looks to you extravagant in operation and unjust in its impact on the consumer, do not blame us.  We asked the commission to investigate it and, if they saw anything in our proposal which they wished to take out, they were free to take it out.  They took nothing out, and that is the code we are operating, and if you want to administer censure on anybody, let it be on the fair trading commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does the consumer get out of Section 3?  How is the consumer to benefit by Section 3?  Is this Bill not designed for the consumer?  The only persons who can possibly get the benefit of Section 3 are the very people whom this Bill is designed to control.  This is a Restrictive Trade Practices Bill. What potential victim of a restrictive trade practice is going to benefit by Section 3?  The present position is that, if anybody is injured by a restrictive trade practice, he can have recourse to the Department and seek investigation.</P>
    <P>If this Bill passed without Section 3, there is this commission to which he can go, make his case and have the practice investigated, but what conceivable advantage is accorded to him by Section 3?  The only person who can get benefit under it is the potential restrictionist. I think it is the queerest position we seem to have manoeuvred <Col N="1851" /> ourselves into, that, having set out with the purpose of putting an end to restrictive trade practices, we are going to establish by Section 3 a citadel into which the restrictionist can safely retreat and thereafter bid defiance to all comers, and, if they object to his activities, refer them to the commission.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to content himself with deleting the section from the Bill altogether and leave the situation then so that anybody could operate whatever practice he thought right and equable, on the understanding that, if any consumer wished to make a case against it, he could complain to the Minister, or the Minister could himself take the initiative and direct the commission to look into it.  Would the Bill not be a much better Bill if Section 3 were removed altogether, and there was no possible citadel for the restrictionist in bad faith to defend himself from, as I think there will be if the section is left in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I find myself in the position of having to disagree with my friend and colleague in his views on Section 3.  It depends on what viewpoint one takes with regard to the general body of the commercial community in this country. Under this section, the commission may prepare and publish rules.  I do not see why the commission preparing and publishing rules at the request of various trades is going to be in any way against the interests of the consumer.  That fair trading commission will be set up with a considerable bias in favour of the consumer and the idea that it will necessarily lean on the side of the industrialist, the businessman or the trade union coming before it is one to which I cannot subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, as I pleaded on the Committee Stage, there is a very large number of trade associations of various types and kinds in the country whose activities, in the opinion of the trade, are absolutely necessary for the proper carrying on of the particular trade. These associations must be placed in the position that they can associate legally for activities which they believe <Col N="1852" /> to be in the interests of the trade generally and not necessarily in any way against the interests of the consumer. They must be placed in the position of knowing whether they are acting legally or illegally and anything else would lead to the most chaotic conditions in industry generally.  I am personally aware of any number of associations which will send in their rules and regulations to the commission and ask how they stand with regard to them.  They do not want to break the law and any situation in which Dáil Éireann passed a Bill which purported, in effect, to find large numbers of people engaged in commerce guilty before they had an opportunity to set their house in order is a situation which we should be very sorry to see arise.</P>
    <P>I personally am in favour of this section.  I feel that any taking away of these powers from the commission will result in commercial chaos of a type which we would be very sorry to see in this country.  I should like the Minister to explain just what he means by &ldquo;any services affecting supply or distribution&rdquo;.  I think I am correct in saying that the second part of Section 3 is the first introduction into the Bill of the principle of &ldquo;services affecting supply or distribution&rdquo; and I should be glad if the Minister would enlarge somewhat on that and explain what he has in mind by the use of that phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case Deputy Dillon is making is based entirely upon the assumption that the Fair Trading Commission may be bamboozled or misled.  That may happen, but I think we will be able to select personnel for the commission who will not be easily bamboozled or misled but who will come conscientiously to this job, having regard to the directives given them, and with no other interest except to ensure that the public are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that we have the right type of commission, is it not desirable that there should be some means by which the rules necessary for the conducting of some particular trade should be prepared as fair trading rules without the people concerned being arraigned as <Col N="1853" /> restrictionists under a later section of the Bill and compulsory Orders made to restrain them?  I think also the Deputy is not adverting to the fact that those who come voluntarily to get fair trading rules made for their trade are, of course, putting themselves in the position that if they do not keep the rules which the commission lay down on their application then, without any further inquiry or procedure, the commission may proceed to report to the Minister and the Minister may proceed to make an Order which can be enacted by the Dáil and made a compulsory Order as far as that trade is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are various ways in which the whole problem of restrictive trade practices can be approached.  There is the approach suggested by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;that the legislation should prohibit all practices which are restrictive of competition in trade and then permit of the drafting of rules by this commission which would release people engaged in particular trades from that omnibus prohibition.  On the other hand, there was the suggestion that we should rely entirely on the courts declaring certain things to be illegal and letting a body of case law be built up over the years by which traders could guide their conduct.  We have tried to adopt a half-way course. We take power to make laws which will be mandatory and enforceable through the courts, but we also want to give trades which claim that they need rules for their proper conduct and which desire that these rules should not be contrary to the public interest an opportunity of having them vetted by a competent authority and sanctioned by them&mdash;it being understood that if the rules so sanctioned, while not initially enforceable in law, are not observed in the trade they can be given the force of law by a subsequent procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell is not quite right in saying that this is the first reference to services in the Bill.  We have amended the Bill in Committee by the insertion of sub-section (2) of Section 6 and thereby given the commission power to inquire into services affecting the supply or distribution of <Col N="1854" /> goods and the circumstances of the trade under investigation by them. That amendment to Section 6 has required consequential amendments to various sections of the Bill.  One is in sub-section (3).  If the commission is to be empowered to investigate the application of services to the distribution of goods then they should have power to deal with the problem if it arose in relation to the making of fair trading rules.  The best example that I can give now is the availability of hire purchase facilities in respect of any particular class of goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am wrong there.  If a trade union made an agreement with an employer&mdash;as some trade unions have&mdash;to make effective a restrictive trade practice, then that practice of the trade union would be subject to investigation under this Bill.  But a trade union's imposing restrictions on the employment of labour&mdash;which is the purpose for which a trade union exists&mdash;would not thereby be subject to investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Restrictive practices which have for their purpose any of the aims which are now set out in the new Schedule are the type of restrictive practice at which this Bill is aimed. I have in mind a case for the purpose of illustrating its application to trade <Col N="1855" /> unions.  Take, for example, a trade where the employers agreed amongst themselves to maintain certain prices and to operate certain restrictions and where the union then agreed with the employers that its members would work only for the employers who observed those rules.  In that case the union would be as liable to be brought before the fair trading commission as the employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with matters of trade.  The commission is confined to matters affecting the supply and distribution of goods. In so far as the Bill is extended to cover services, it relates to services carried on as a trade.  That is the distinction I make with services of another kind&mdash;the services with which a trade union is concerned, the services given by a worker to his employer.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 6 (1), line 34, to delete the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill we pressed upon the Minister that he should accept the amendment to the effect that the whole inquiry should be held by all the members of the commission. The Minister resisted that claim at the time.  We now suggest a halfway house&mdash;that at least two members of the commission should hold the inquiry.  The analogy I want to put rather strongly is the analogy which is in the Land Commission. Though there are four lay commissioners, two of them have always to deal with an important inquiry in the work of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I think it is essential that, in the work of this commission, we get some stereotyped procedure and some uniformity of practice.  You are going to get that far better by having a commission working with more than one member holding the inquiry.  Apart from that, all of us who have any experience in dealing with this type of body, know that no matter how good he may be otherwise, a single individual is inclined, when making an inquiry, to look at it from the point of view of the individual.  It would be much better, it would strengthen the commission very much and strengthen the acceptance of the commission by the public, if at least two members did, in fact, deal with an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> I appreciate, of course, that the whole commission, as such, must report, but quite clearly that report is going to be coloured and judged almost entirely by the views of the particular member of the commission who makes the inquiry.  I think it would be far better if the inquiry were always made by at least two members of the commission rather than by one. I think that the Minister's purpose in drafting the section in this form originally was that he wanted to provide that the whole work of the commission would not be held up if one of the members happened to be sick.  To increase the number from one to two is not going to prevent the work going ahead, and is undoubtedly going to lead to much more uniformity of practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered every suggestion that was made in the Committee Stage of the discussion, and I accepted them wherever I thought it was desirable to do so; but this was one amendment which I found I could not accept.  I think that, to some extent, the suggestion was made originally on the assumption that the commission was to be composed of persons representative of particular interests, and that it was undesirable that one person representing a particular interest should conduct the inquiry.  That is not what is intended. It is intended that the members of the commission, three in number, will have equal qualifications, and that each will be competent to conduct an inquiry on his own if it is considered desirable in suitable cases that such an arrangement should be followed.</P>
      <P>The intention is not to provide against the possibility of a member being sick because that could be covered by a particular type of provision, but rather to permit of the possibility of more than one inquiry being in progress at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors which I had to take into account in considering the framework of this Bill and one of the criticisms which was made of the measure, was that it would be slow in producing results.  I thought that it would expedite matters if, in suitable <Col N="1858" /> cases, a single member of the commission could conduct the inquiry.  I do not think any problem arises about maintaining uniformity of practice because, of course, the report which the commission will make to the Minister will be the report of the whole commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Based entirely on the report of that single member of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  He will not make a report in that sense. He will conduct the inquiry.  He will record the information which is forthcoming at the inquiry and, presumably, a typescript report of the whole proceedings will be available to all the members of the commission.  He will be merely an investigator for the commission and not a person upon whose report the decision of the commission will be taken.</P>
      <P>I should think that, in the early stages of the commission's work, all the cases will be of such a character that the whole commission would consider it desirable to conduct an inquiry, but that there will be suitable cases&mdash;that is cases of an uncomplicated or minor character&mdash;where it would facilitate and expedite the work of the commission to have the inquiry carried out by one member.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the example of the Land Commission.  I was rather thinking of the Industrial Development Authority where, as the Deputies opposite know, specific sections of work are given to each member of the authority.  In that section he has acted, and still acts, as the individual who holds the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure, but, in fact, it is he who meets the people concerned on the particular issue that he is investigating; he gets all the information which he thinks that body will require, and then brings that information to his colleagues who decide on the line that should be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes it impossible to enforce.  The argument is that if you put in &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo; then you do not merely have to prove the fact of neglect; you have to prove the state of mind of the individual responsible for the neglect.  I am advised that the insertion of the word would in fact nullify the whole provision of the section.</P>

      <P>Take an ordinary contract for sale.  The provision always there is &ldquo;except in the case of wilful default of the vendor&rdquo;.  You do not have to prove attitude of mind.  I think the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is construed in these circumstances as being somewhat more than mere neglect&mdash;a positively stupid neglect, so to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that this wording would have the effect that I have said.  It would mean that a director could be as negligent as he liked and let his company engage in any number of restrictive practices and still escape the consequences of it <Col N="1863" /> because of the difficulty of proving that it was done deliberately, that it was not mere negligence but deliberate negligence, that you would require to prove that state of mind rather than the fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the legal connotation of &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;. It is certainly not the legal connotation that I am trying to get at.  I think the words &ldquo;been facilitated by any neglect on the part of any person&rdquo; are too wide.  I was trying to imply &ldquo;facilitated by any wilful neglect&rdquo;&mdash;in the sense of any serious act of neglect. Perhaps the Minister would consider something on those lines before the Bill goes to the other House.</P>

      <P>In my amendment, No. 15, I have gone a long way to meet the objection raised to the section originally.  As redrafted, the onus of proof is completely on the prosecutor. There is no longer any doubt about that.  That was the purpose of redrafting. I think it goes a long way to meet the point.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Or.&rdquo;  If the Minister puts in &ldquo;or neglect&rdquo; it can be taken that he was neglectful in not turning up at that meeting and he can be convicted for that.  That is not what is intended.  I know perfectly well what the Minister has in mind, and I agree with what is in his mind, but it is not expressed in this form of words, and I do not agree with the Minister that the interpretation put upon <Col N="1864" />&ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is an interpretation which necessitates consideration of the state of mind.  I think that is the lay use of &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; and not the use of &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; as it would be used legally.</P>

Take the further case of correspondence.  Something comes in in the correspondence and, through neglect, the individual director, whoever he may be, does not give the correspondence the care which he should give it.</P>

We do not seek here to make a director liable if his negligence is only of the character which would make him liable in a civil suit but to make him liable if he is guilty of that class of negligence which would damnify him in criminal proceedings.

      <P>There was a discussion about the provision in the Schedule relating to the possibility of a member being personally interested in a particular matter under inquiry and objection was taken to the provision that he should not act unless authorised by the Minister.  I have redrafted the Schedule so as to make it a little tighter than it was, to meet the point raised in Committee. It provides that he will not act as a member during the consideration of the matter, unless the Minister, being of opinion that his interest is not such as to interfere with the impartial performance of his duties, authorises him to act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make certain submissions on the Money Resolution. I make them with special reference to the Money Resolution because the observations I wish to tender now have a very restricted relevance, and I desire to keep them within that narrow relevance for the purpose of the Resolution.  In presenting this Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary told us of estimated costings which had been furnished to him and the estimated price at which the product of the grass meal plant might be marketed if the conditions obtaining now remained stable or any way near stable.  I now submit to him that the costings which have been furnished to him bear little or no relation to the experience of people who have been engaged in this business for some time in this country. Personally, I can neither vouch for the Parliamentary Secretary's costings nor the costings I submit to him now.  I am merely drawing his attention to this in case he should think it expedient to make further and better inquiries before proceeding with this enterprise.</P>
      <P>I think he stated in the Dáil that he hoped to see grass meal produced in Bangor-Erris at about £22 7s. per ton.  I am told that where the procedure has been mechanised to the highest possible degree on the best possible land obtainable for the growing of grass the lowest costing which has been achieved has been in the order of £25 6s. per ton.  It has to be borne in mind that this costing was achieved in Great Britain where the price of fertilisers is much lower than here and where other costs may not be as high as they are here.  It has been suggested by those experienced in the production of grass meal under our conditions that the cost will be in the order of £29 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged further to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that he informed us that his best advice was that this product might sell at something between £31 and £34 per ton according to quality.  I understand that before estimating the receipts of this enterprise from the grass meal one has to have regard to the experience of other vendors who <Col N="1872" /> have found in practice that the average price realised by them during the year 1952 was £31 2s. per ton, from which they had to deduct £1 7s. per ton, leaving them a net revenue of £29 15s: I understand that persons who have been engaged in this business find that the domestic requirement of this commodity, which is mainly from compound feed manufacturers, does not absorb and cannot be hoped to absorb more than 7,000 tons annually, that other producers are in the position to produce 5,000 tons, that the addition of 4,000 tons per annum to the total supply will involve the necessity for exporting a considerable part of the total production of the Bangor-Erris plant, and that it is highly unlikely at the prices ruling in Great Britain or the United States of America that on these costings it will be possible to compete in either of these markets where the product is on sale at a price substantially less than our costings would suggest it is possible for us to accept with any prospect of success.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I think all the facts that I now lay before the Parliamentary Secretary are already in the possession of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. While I do not, for a moment, question his good faith in this matter, I think it would have been somewhat more disingenuous if he had told us plainly and bluntly that these costings had been submitted to him and that he just did not accept them; that he preferred the calculations of the Sugar Company and Bord na Móna to the computations of those who have reported their experiences to him.  I think he also had a duty to tell us on his own initiative that the advices he had received from the Department of Agriculture were of so sulphurous a character he thought it better to ignore them.</P>
    <P>I really wish to see any enterprise to which the Parliamentary Secretary puts his hand in the general sphere of his activities meet with success.  I would be sorry to see an enterprise of this kind initiated in Bangor-Erris with the best intentions in the world, subsequently folding up simply because it could not pay its way.  I would prefer to see it continue as a fifth alcohol factory which makes one's heart turn <Col N="1873" /> over every time one looks at it.  I would ask the House to remember that we already have in Ballycroy an alcohol factory.  I do not know what the cost of the production of industrial alcohol is at the moment, but I would remind the House that on the last occasion on which I had an opportunity of knowing what the cost is we would have saved a substantial sum of money per annum if, instead of operating the alcohol factory, we had blown it up, dumped all the potatoes in the Atlantic Ocean and paid the wages of the employees in full in perpetuity.</P>
    <P>Let us not initiate in the Gaeltacht another enterprise of that kind.  We must bear in mind that the Parliamentary Secretary has said that in dwelling on the costings of this enterprise, we must have regard not only to grass but to certain other crops to which they may ultimately put their hand.  One of these is peppermint for the extraction of oil.  I think he told us that in large areas of the United States of America this crop has practically perished as a result of disease.  I have no reason to believe that such diseases are endemic here but I am bound to tell the House that while I was Minister for Agriculture two or three <i>entrepreneurs</i> approached the Department to seek our encouragement for the launching of such enterprises.  Acting on the advice of those qualified to advise me, I was bound to say to each of these that while the Department would be anxious to help them in any way it could, no encouragement for the prosecution of such enterprises could be given since past experience had proved that attempts to grow these oil-bearing crops, such as lavender, peppermint, linseed and so on, had not been attended with any substantial degree of success.</P>
    <P>Our experience notwithstanding, most of these crops have been tried in England.  Apart from some small operators, who have never shown any evidence of developing into millionaires, as one would expect them to do since they enjoy a monopoly of an immensely valuable market, there has been no large-scale success in the cultivation of these crops in Great Britain so far as I can recollect.  I do not know <Col N="1874" /> if these facts have been brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary, but I think he ought to examine them closely and, in justifying this Financial Resolution to the House, reassure us that he has examined the submissions and, having weighed them to the best of his ability, is determined on the merits to disregard them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous occasion when this matter was under discussion I was unavoidably absent.  I would like to take this opportunity of welcoming the Bill and I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I will co-operate in any way I can in the implementation of this measure.  Those of us who know North Mayo know that it is necessary to formulate schemes for this area because of the considerable number of unemployed.  I sincerely hope this experiment will bear fruit. It would be indeed disastrous, as Deputy Dillon has said, if it should prove to be a failure.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that a considerable sum of money is involved.  On behalf of the people of Mayo I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for having selected Bangor-Erris as the area of operations.  I am not as competent as Deputy Dillon to judge the merits or demerits of this undertaking.  He has, apparently, gone into the matter very thoroughly.  He has, of course, an advantage over ordinary Deputies since he has had long experience of public life, experience as a Minister for Agriculture and as a businessman.  I am sure his criticism is worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>It is always a good thing to take into account the possibility of an export market for any commodity produced here.  Within the confines of the State itself there is a limited market.  For the first two or three years it is only to be expected that production will be slow.  I hope that after that period the project will be worked to its fullest extent and that it will prove successful.</P>
      <P>I think the House should have some more detail than has been given so far by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He was somewhat vague in outlining the proposed scheme.  Many people are in doubt as to what exactly the scheme is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> Some of the people in the area have had dealings with the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands in connection with the acquisition of land.  They have also had dealings with Bord na Móna in that connection.  Most of them are very critical of the manner in which they have been treated by these bodies with particular reference to the payment made for land acquired from them.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take this seriously into consideration when he is acquiring land.  While many of these places may not look a whole lot to his experts they are homes and places to which people can return from foreign countries and spend a period of the year.  I would ask him also to consider in a very particular way, if he is acquiring land, taking steps to see that people are suitably compensated and that payment will be made much faster by expediting the work of the various Departments I mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Hara had been here on the last occasion he would know that the main criticism of this provision was that it was a scheme that had comparatively little labour content in it for the amount of money being spent and that other schemes, with the provision of the same amount of money, could have produced a far greater labour content.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary said on the last occasion that the capital content was estimated at £165,000.  I want to get some breakdown of that figure from him.  I want to know how that £165,000 is to be divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be more appropriate to discuss it on Section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Money Resolution is the more appropriate section on which to discuss it.  Section 13 deals only with the free grant of funds to the company.  There are two different things involved.  There is, first of all, the reclamation and cultivation of bogland and, secondly, the production of grass meal.  As I see it, if I left my discussion to Section 13 I might be restricted purely to the <Col N="1876" /> second portion, whereas I want to get the two as an integrated whole.</P>
      <P>As far as I can find out, the estimates that were given on the last occasion by the Parliamentary Secretary are miles away from the correct position. The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that we will start on a basis of 2,000 acres.  Let us get some facts on that. No. 1, what does he estimate that will cost and, No. 2, what figure will he put in for the drainage of that amount? When he has got his bog drained so that something can be done with it, he will have to decide how to utilise it.  I do not necessarily mean how he will utilise it from the point of view of grass meal or otherwise, but whether he is going to utilise the whole 2,000 acres for the same purpose at the same time.  If he is, then he will want to fence off that 2,000 acres and there will only be the cost of fencing one block of 2,000 acres.  But if, as I anticipate, he cannot possibly utilise the whole lot of that area that he has bought in the same way at the same time, then he must provide in his capital cost for the cost of fencing not merely the block as a whole, but the block into the individual sections.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made the point here on the Second Stage that the climate of Bangor-Erris was such that you could not possibly hope to graze this reclaimed bogland in the winter.  I presume, therefore, that what you would have to do is to strip graze in some shape or form in the summer. What would be the cost of fencing in respect of that?</P>
      <P>When you have got as far as that you must apply the initial dressing of artificial manures.  What initial dressing per acre does the Parliamentary Secretary propose?  What dressing of lime does he propose?  What dressing of fertilisers does he propose?  What is the cost for that and what is the cost of spreading it?  When all that is done, when the bog is made fit for growing something, how does he propose to cultivate it?  What does he propose to sow in it and what is the cost for so doing?  All that will be the cost initially of getting something on this particular 2,000 acres of bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, which I might <Col N="1877" /> perhaps call the fixed bog cost, you will have very substantial costs in regard to equipment.  What type of equipment, very roughly, will be bought?  Approximately, what will it cost?  When we get all that we will have an opportunity of seeing at that stage what the annual labour expenditure will be.  I venture to suggest that in the capital outlay that is concerned I imagine, from what the Parliamentary Secretary said on the last occasion, it will take perhaps a couple of years.  There may be a certain number of people employed for those two years and once the capital money is spent we will consider the annual employment. So far as I can recollect, the Parliamentary Secretary admitted the last time that a fair labour content was about £1 per ton.  That means that the sole permanent employment value of this scheme will be a sum of £4,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's suggestion for utilising the fund would produce a far better employment content that £4,000 per annum.  I am afraid that when the people of Bangor-Erris realise how little there will be by way of employment content in this scheme they will realise they have, to a great extent, on the employment end of it, been sold a pup.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate the discussion on the different sections in Committee but I will endeavour to meet the questions that have been asked by Deputies Dillon, O'Hara and Sweetman.  First of all, I take it that Deputy Dillon's sources of information are the same as mine, a certain association connected with the drying and production of grass meal. The type of activity envisaged at Bangor-Erris bog is not of the same type as is being carried out by the members of this particular association. They are growing grass and drying grass grown on good land and producing grass meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have no experience of the reclamation of bogland and the cultivation of it for the purpose of growing grass.  Nevertheless, I have had some conversations with the representatives of the association, and I am sure they will inform Deputy Dillan that I have <Col N="1878" /> been very frank with them on each occasion on which they approached me. They were not as an association consulted by me on behalf of the Government. However, so far as I had the figures, I made them very readily available to the representatives of that association on each occasion they did come.  I cannot recollect the word being used by the person who spoke to me as the word &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo;, and I cannot say whether he agreed with my figures.  As it was a casual conversation I forget what the actual terms of his reply were.  Nevertheless, I submit that the figures I quoted, in relation to the figures supplied by Deputy Dillon or supplied by the association to Deputy Dillon as he announced them here, are not in the least unrealistic.  I mentioned a figure on the last occasion of £22 7s. per ton as the cost of production of grass meal at the plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The figures were brought to me and I thought it right <Col N="1879" /> to bring them to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it was done out of the Deputy's sense of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make any point in regard to the word &ldquo;behest&rdquo;.  It was probably ill-chosen.  However, the figure quoted by me here was £22 7s. That is the figure I used on the Second Stage of the Bill.  The figure which the Deputy quoted, as being more realistic, as the cost of production per ton was £29 10s. or £29 15s.  To the £22 7s. must be added the cost of pelleting and bagging.  That would add to the cost pretty substantially&mdash; at least £2 per ton.  I take it the cost of £29 10s. quoted by Deputy Dillon is the cost of bagged grass meal. Therefore, I suggest that, in the light of these figures, the actual figures quoted by me are not unrealistic as compared with those quoted by Deputy Dillon.  I understand the cost of bagging is pretty substantial.  The cost I got was £22 7s. per ton, to which must be added the cost of bagging, which would bring it much nearer to the £29 quoted by Deputy Dillon as the realistic costs supplied to him.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of a market, it is well to remember that, in 1948, which was the first year in which grass meal was produced commercially in this country, there were approximately only 650 tons produced, and, without any wide publicity campaign, that figure has been increased sevenfold between 1948 and 1952&mdash;to the extent of 4,000 tons produced last year, 1952. Therefore, while I respect the figures quoted by Deputy Dillon, the overall figures for feeding stuffs, I believe there is still ample scope for the production of grass meal as a constituent of feeding stuffs.  I want to assure the Deputy, and to assure the association through him, that there is no suggestion whatever that the production of grass meal in Bangor-Erris is to be in competition or is intended to prejudice the present producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Upon my word, that <Col N="1880" /> would not worry me one bit.  It is not worrying me that you are going to compete with them.  What I am afraid of is that you will not be able to compete with them and that you will be sunk up to your neck in debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other matters of detail which would probably bring the cost of production in Bangor-Erris much lower.  There is, for instance, the utilisation of the fuel which is actually won in the drainage of the bog itself. The cost of drying to the present producers is very substantial, and I believe that the cost of drying in the Bangor-Erris project will be much less than under the present methods of production.</P>

I was also asked what the cost of the initial fertilising and the initial sowings would be.  The initial liming and fertilising costs are estimated at £24 per acre.</P>

I have said that the cost of liming and fertilising is estimated at £24 and the cost of first sowing cultivation is £4 per acre.  The total is estimated to cost £56,000.  Drying plant and equipment is expected to cost £43,000.  These are the figures which Deputy Sweetman asked me to give at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is going a bit outside this Bill.  It is expected that there will be about ten miles of fencing at about £400 per mile.  It is well to remember that the decision in regard to the methods that will be employed in respect of the actual development work is one for the company.  I think it would be wrong for me either by provision in the Bill or by suggestion to tie the hands of the company. However, the estimates I have given are fairly liberal estimates in so far as we could get actual experience in draining, fertilising and producing grass on bog which is even worse than the bog we experienced anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like the House to remember that this is a purely experimental project for the purpose of winning bogland to make it productive. Deputy O'Hara well knows that there is plenty of bogland to be won in that area and the more we can win and put into a condition that will produce grass <Col N="1882" /> the more satisfactory it will be for the people of the area and the country generally.</P>

I am informed by very good authority that even at the present time there is growing on bogland and other types of poor land in the West of Ireland very valuable plants capable of being distilled or otherwise processed to produce valuable commercial products used for medicinal and aromatic purposes generally.</P>
      <P>I have positive evidence of a shepherd in Donegal or in one of those counties being paid by a person in Dublin at the rate of £1 sterling per 1 lb. avoirdupois for these plants growing wild on bogland.  I am also advised that even with a little care and cultivation these type of plants can be made grow and made a very lucrative source of income for the people in those western areas.</P>

That is to say, £40,000 for the drainage of the bog; £4,000 for the fencing of it; £48,000 for liming and fertilising it and £8,000 for cultivating it.  I think that makes a total of £100,000 exclusive of purchase.  Probably Bord na Móna pay in or around £1 per acre and, perhaps, £2 as a maximum.</P>

Would the Parliamentary Secretary find a single Deputy from any Party who represents a constituency west of the Shannon who shares his belief that there is growing wild in the Province of Connaught or Ulster a plant which can be readily and freely retailed at £2,240 per ton and that to date no living creature has even bothered to sow it?  If that is the basis on which the Parliamentary Secretary has been persuaded to sponsor this financial resolution it makes me tremble to think of what we are embarking upon.  I must confess to being somewhat shocked that if the Parliamentary Secretary was told by anybody that such a potential golconda existed he did not seek the advice or at least the opinion of the Department of Agriculture and communicate it to the House at the same time as he paints the picture, which I have no doubt has been reported to him, of this peripatetic thesis to pluck off the weeds of Donegal a crop worth £2,240 per ton and was left to garner that crop alone.  If there was such a crop to be had in the West of Ireland the Klondike would be nothing compared to the stampede that would take place to it.  What miner ever worked in the Klondike got a return proportionate to that?  I exhort the Parliamentary <Col N="1884" /> Secretary that he had better be mighty careful because if his words are accepted there will be such an exodus from Dublin to the West of Ireland as will frighten the nation.</P>

      <P>I would not bother to reply to the last remark if I thought the Deputy was trying to ridicule what I said.  On the evidence supplied to me there is such a plant growing.  To carry the story further, there is in existence in Dublin a small company which grows and processes these type of plants.  The demand that company has for its processed goods is far in excess of what they can fulfil.  It was the pioneer of that process and of that company who gave me the information that he himself paid £1 sterling for one lb. weight for this type of plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It had a Latin name.  I cannot remember.  Possibly there were two or three different types of plant, but to strengthen my story, a friend of that particular gentleman, who also happens to be a friend of mine, got some advice from this skilled person, and on one day of his annual holidays in West Cork he brought his younger brother, who had some idea of the type of wild plants to look for, and they brought them back in a bag to County Dublin and he got £3 in money for his day's wandering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone through the bog in question on several occasions, and I have watched the efforts of these plants to grow.  The Sugar Company planted, say, an acre of a number of plants of the nature described by the Parliamentary Secretary, and after the first year they found that there was very little turnover. The agricultural expert there has definitely said that he believes that, with experience, he can increase the output of the plants in question. These plants are growing already in a wild state on various bogs in the country, but there is a snag attached to the collecting and it is this, that to collect a pound weight of this type of plant would take you considerably more than a day.  There is no use in the House getting the impression that one can fly to some bog or mountainside in the West of Ireland and in a day collect even £1 worth of these plants.  I know for a fact that some young fellows had the idea that Deputy Dillon has enunciated, that they could become rich overnight from the collection, but they gave it up after a day or two when they found they would make more money working a bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual commercial planting by the Sugar Company is likely to prove a success, and I would be the last to suggest that we should damn this venture in its initial stages, in view of the fact that the Sugar Company have taken the pioneer steps.  What I would suggest to the Parliamentary <Col N="1886" /> Secretary is that he should consult with the Sugar Company and get the latest possible information from their experts on this type of plant he has mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has done that, to give him credit.  He is in close touch with the Sugar Company.  When I was a child, there used to be a song about a little white hen and at the end of the song no one knew the name of the little white hen&mdash;the hen's name was Treminion&mdash;and if you did not discover it you suffered death and destruction. Everyone is telling you about this plant like Klondike gold, but no one can tell you the name.  Surely someone must know the name of this goldmine?</P>

      <P>In view of this extraordinary statement&mdash;I sincerely hope it is true in every detail&mdash;I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary try to get the name of this particular plant or weed and broadcast to the nation at a very early date in order to clear up the matter.  I can visualise a situation where the farmers in the West of Ireland, who in the ordinary way are very hard-working men, will neglect tillage this year and go round the country hunting for this plant.  If they were aware of the name or of the type of plant, maybe they would never be more profitably employed.  I think it is a little like the leprechaun's crock of gold&mdash;they will be for ever trying to get hold of this plant and will not know what they are after.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will inquire more into the matter and broadcast to the nation some night.  It would be much appreciated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to see whether the figures are on a sound basis or not.  Apart from the £100,000 for which we have now extracted the details, with difficulty, there must be some substantial cost each year in fertilisers, in depreciation and such things as will have no labour content.  What annual figure is included for those things in the estimates that the Parliamentary Secretary has before him?  What estimate has he got of the annual cost of keeping these two acres producing grass year after year, leaving aside the factory cost?  I want to try and divide the bog cost from the factory cost.  We feel on this side of the House that, so far as this scheme is concerned with the utilisation of bog, producing something that is usable from bog, it is a sound scheme; but where we think the Parliamentary Secretary has gone wrong is that, when he has got the bog producing, he is going to channel off the product in production that it is going to be difficult to sell and bad from a labour content point of view. The Parliamentary Secretary will realise that it is essential to get the breakdown between the cost on the bog and the drying cost.</P>

That is a sum of £100,000 for initial bog production. The Parliamentary Secretary also told us that the drying plant involved a sum of £43,000, which makes a total of £143,000.  The Bill provides for £165,000 free grant and £100,000 capital, a total of £265,000.  I want to know what the additional £122,000 is for.

      <P>The annual costs are expected to work out in the region of £89,000.  It is hardly likely that the £89,000 will be required in the first year.  However, the £100,000 share capital is really the working capital of the company.  To break up the figure, the annual overhead is estimated at £38,000; annual field costs £22,800; drying costs, including fuel and labour, £20,500.  That amounts to £81,300.</P>

      <P>I should be obliged if the Parliamentary Secretary would agree <Col N="1893" /> to look into one detail between now and the Fourth or Fifth Stage, whichever is the more convenient for him. He mentioned a sum of £11,000 for a transformer which is, presumably, to convert current taken from the high power line of the new electric station at Bangor-Erris.  What is the power required for?  Is it required to grind 4,000 tons of grass per annum into grass meal?  I would ask him to consider the implications of such a contemplated expenditure.  £11,000 for a transformer to bring the current to a mill to grind 4,000 tons of grass in grass meal! Why, I could do it with a mill that would be installed in any ordinary farmer's backyard. If the Parliamentary Secretary suggested that that transformer was a preliminary step for setting up a mill for that purpose, an ordinary farmer would think it daft.  Apart from lighting, and so forth, I do not know what function the transformer could be used for since the Parliamentary Secretary told us it was not intended to use it for the actual drying.  I do not think we ought to press for a refinement of detail at this stage but perhaps it could be mentioned at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill, as Deputies are aware, is to improve and extend the existing health services so as to make those services more readily available to certain sections of the public.  Because medical treatment is becoming more expensive as well as more efficient, these sections find it increasingly difficult to bear the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to-day to describe the scope of the existing services.  That has already been done in some detail in the White Paper issued last July. That White Paper was issued to give a broad indication of the Government's intentions so that interested parties could say what they thought of them. I have since heard from large numbers of organisations, public bodies and private individuals and, on the whole, the reaction to the Government's proposals has been favourable.  There was almost unanimity on the question of the necessity for improvement and extension. The views expressed on the scope of the extensions were not so unanimous.  When I met the local authorities, for instance, I was told by representatives of the farming community that the £50 valuation limit for farmers was too low and the £600 income limit was too high, and by some of the representatives who were not farmers that the £50 valuation limit was too high and the £600 limit too low.  Some groups told me I was going too far.  Others were very vehement that I was not going far enough.  There was fairly general <Col N="1895" /> agreement that the broad lines of development were right, but a few minority groups told me that the general lines were all wrong and that, instead of developing the services along the lines on which the public assistance services and the public health services had been developed, namely, under democratic local authority control, what was needed was an entirely new approach which would virtually cut out the local authorities and hand over the services to sectional groups.  Perhaps the most consistent criticism was that because the proposed developments were relatively costly, though necessary, they should be financed without direct charge on the ratepayers, which means that the cost should be met from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have considered very carefully every suggestion made to me and the Bill now before the House shows certain departures from the White Paper as a result.  Naturally, the Bill will not satisfy everybody, and if I were to try to achieve that I would probably meet with the same fate as the man with the ass.</P>
    <P>A large part of the Bill is made up of unrelated minor provisions and amendments of earlier legislation which experience has shown to be desirable, but in which no major question of policy or principle is involved. The Second Reading is not the time to deal with them.  They are more appropriate for explanation and discussion on the Committee Stage.  A further large part is concerned with the re-enactment, in modified form, of certain provisions of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  The only new principle involved is the handing over of the administration of certain provisions of that Act from the public assistance authority to the health authority.  As the health authority and the public assistance authority are usually one and the same body, e.g., the county council (in Limerick County Borough, the corporation), the effect so far as public representation is concerned will be negligible.  The change will facilitate administration, and it will, I hope, mark the last stage in <Col N="1896" /> the development of medical assistance from a pauper service to the parity which in latter years it has had with the other health services.  The case for the change is so obvious that I do not think I need do more than mention the proposal.  An exception has to be made in the case of certain public assistance authorities in the Dublin, Cork and Waterford areas pending other changes at present under discussion with local authorities in those areas.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are concerned with the new or extended services, but before I deal with them I wish to direct the particular attention of the House to Sections 4 and 63.  Section 4 lays down clearly that a person is under no obligation to avail himself of any of the services provided under the Bill if he does not want to and that he may not be compelled under the Bill to submit himself to medical examination or treatment. Section 63 provides that the Minister for Health will have no power to direct a local authority to make any particular service available to any particular person.  I hope that during the discussion on the Bill these two provisions, and the intentions underlying them, will not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Before going further I would like to tell Deputies, so that they need not tell me, that there are several means tests in this Bill.  I never at any time claimed the contrary.  If there was no means test, we would have a free-for-all scheme as they have in England&mdash; it is far removed from that by the application of means tests.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with the services which, under the Bill and existing legislation, will be available to each of the three categories described in the White Paper as the lower income group, the middle income group and the higher income group.</P>
    <P>Persons in the lower income group will be entitled to general practitioner medical care in local authority dispensaries or in their own houses, exactly as at present except that it is proposed to simplify the arrangements by which they will prove their entitlement to the service.  They will be entitled to free hospital and specialist treatment as they are at present, but a much better specialist service will be <Col N="1897" /> provided locally as part of the policy of bringing these services to the people in their own counties rather than requiring people to go to the cities for such services.  They will be entitled to free medical and nursing care in respect of motherhood, as at present, but with the very important difference, that the patient can choose her doctor instead of the present arrangement under which she must accept the services of the dispensary doctor for her district.  They will be entitled to bring their pre-school children to child welfare clinics for examination and advice (it will take time to establish such clinics outside the larger towns).  They will be entitled to the benefits of an improved school health examination scheme and to improved dental and ophthalmic services, all without direct charge, with the minor exception that a small charge may be made for replacement of spectacles damaged through carelessness.  A new cash grant of £4 per confinement will be payable in addition to any grant payable under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This grant will be paid to the wife of an uninsured as well as an insured man.</P>
    <P>Persons in the middle income group will be entitled to dental and ophthalmic services but charges may be made in respect of such services.  They will be entitled to other specialist services free of charge and to hospital services either free of charge or, where they can afford it, at a cost not exceeding two guineas a week at the discretion of the health authority.  They will be entitled to free medical and nursing care in respect of motherhood (with choice of doctor) and for infants up to six weeks, with hospital and specialist backing free whenever necessary.  They will be entitled to bring their pre-school children for examination and advice to child welfare clinics and to receive dental and ophthalmic treatment in respect of defects discovered at these clinics.  They will be entitled to avail of the school health examination services, including free hospital, dental and ophthalmic treatment for defects discovered at the school examinations if the school is a national school.</P>
    <P>Persons in the higher income group <Col N="1898" /> can, on payment of an annual contribution not exceeding £1 a year, get free medical and nursing care in respect of motherhood with hospital and specialist treatment where necessary and similar services in respect of children under six weeks.  They can obtain the same services as the middle income group at child welfare clinics and they can avail of the school health examination services, with free hospital, dental and ophthalmic treatment for defects discovered at such examinations if the school is a national school.</P>
    <P>All three groups will continue to be entitled to free diagnosis and treatment for infectious diseases, including hospital and sanatorium treatment.</P>
    <P>Nobody has suggested to me that there is anything wrong with what is suggested for the lower income group. There seems to be general agreement that the £4 cash grant is a very desirable addition to the existing services and the proposed arrangement for choice of doctor for maternity has been specially welcomed by all men of good will even by those who have offered objective criticism to other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the definition of the middle income group there has been some controversy.  While there is agreement that it has become necessary, due to the increased cost of medical care, to do something for people outside the public assistance group, the limits for hospital and specialist services of £600 income and £50 valuation have been under fire, some contending that they are too low and others that they are too high. There is a good deal to be said on both sides but I feel that the introduction of the power to enable a local authority on the one hand to impose a charge, and, on the other hand, giving them discretion in cases of hardship will give the amount of latitude needed in the matter and should satisfy most of the critics.  It will be a matter for local authorities to apply the section in accordance with their own assessment of local needs.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that a free general practitioner service, on the model of the dispensary service or otherwise, should be extended to this <Col N="1899" /> middle income class for contingencies other than maternity.  I am not satisfied that such an extension is really necessary.  It is rarely that payment for general practitioner care becomes a hardship for anybody but the very poorest and in my experience general practitioners have always been ready to adjust their fees, often to purely nominal amounts, in cases of hardship without making any compliment of the adjustment.  I cannot conceive a catastrophe arising out of such expenses as one might meet from repeated or prolonged terms in hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to be under no illusion about the application of the charge for hospital treatment for persons in the middle income group as it affects those insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Heretofore, large numbers of these persons got their hospital treatment free, the cost being borne on National Health Insurance funds and latterly as a temporary measure on the Exchequer.  They may now have to pay up to two guineas a week, at the discretion of the health authority.  In defence of the charge, I want to make the following points:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Firstly, every insured person was not eligible for hospital treatment.  He had to be in insurance for a certain period and to have a certain number of contributions paid.  In fact, only about two-thirds of those insured were eligible.</P>
    <P>Secondly, only the insured person, and not his dependents, was eligible.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the period for which the benefit was payable was limited to six weeks in hospital.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there was no guarantee of the availability of funds for this or other additional benefits.  It depended on a surplus of funds at the periodic revaluations of National Health Insurance funds.  The recent arrangement under which the Exchequer met the charge was, as I have mentioned, a purely temporary one pending the availability of the new health services being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It should be mentioned that the contributions payable under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, do not include any <Col N="1900" /> element for hospital treatment.  Many insured persons will, of course, fall within the lower income group and will consequently qualify for free hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>In the light of all this and of the long discussions we had here last year on the Social Welfare Bill, it surprises me that a Deputy should have put down a question recently asking what reduction would now be made in the social welfare contributions because insured persons would not in future be getting these additional benefits as social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I think the insured person in this group is making a good bargain in getting a right to a free or heavily subsidised hospital service for himself and his dependents in exchange for the possibility of a limited free service for a limited period for himself alone.</P>
    <P>I come now to the higher income group.  The only change made from the White Paper proposals in regard to that group is that maternity services will be made available only to such, outside the &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; class, as pay an annual contribution of £1 to the health authority.</P>
    <P>I think it wise to anticipate here certain objections which may be made during the debate.</P>
    <P>We have been told that we are putting the cart before the horse in bringing in a scheme without having the facilities, in beds and buildings, to give effect to it and that what is needed is to provide the physical facilities and the rest will take care of itself.  It is hard to understand this criticism in view of the hospital building that is going on all over the country.</P>
    <P>If we first take maternity accommodation in hospitals, there are at present about 1,100 hospital beds for maternity patients (excluding about 640 beds in private maternity homes) The number of births each year is about 63,000, so that if we take it that each bed can on average take 25 patients in a year, nearly 28,000 out of this 63,000 or 44 per cent. can at present be accommodated for child birth in a hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that so?  Under the present hospital construction programme, nearly 550 additional maternity beds will be provided in hospitals, nearly half as many again as we have at present.  When these are added to the existing accommodation there will be a total of 1,650 hospital beds, which can accommodate over 65 per cent. of the births. Ignoring private maternity homes, which could cater for another 15,000, or 24 per cent., it will be seen that most, if not all, those desiring accommodation in a maternity hospital can be provided with it.  It is expected, however, that many mothers, particularly in rural areas, will, as at present, prefer to stay at home for the birth. The introduction of the new service should not, therefore, give rise to an unanswerable demand for accommodation in maternity hospitals.  Incidentally, the standard of hospitalisation for maternity aimed at in Britain is 50 per cent.  In Denmark, where the standard of medical services is regarded as very good, only about 40 per cent. of confinements take place in hospitals.  In Holland the figure is lower still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar increases in the number of beds provided in hospitals throughout the country for general medical and surgical purposes should mean that there will not be undue pressure on accommodation in those hospitals. About 270 additional beds in general hospitals have already been provided <Col N="1902" /> under the present hospital construction programme and, by the end of 1954, a further 640 will be provided.  By the end of 1955, this total will be raised to 1,100.  The building programme includes substantial additions to the accommodation required for certain specialities which have never previously been adequately catered for in this country&mdash;notably children's ailments, mental deficiency, orthopædics and cancer.  Hospitals to deal with cases under all four of those heads are being built at the moment.  Roughly, 100 beds for children have been provided in recent years and a further 390 will be provided by the end of 1955.  For mental defectives 230 additional beds have already been provided under the programme, and a further 1,050 will be provided by the end of next year. By the end of 1955 this figure of 1,050 additional beds will have become 1,110. Over 300 beds for orthopædic patients have been provided and another 133-bed hospital for the same type of patient is being built.</P>
    <P>A new cancer hospital will accommodate 150 patients and provide full diagnosis and treatment.  These increases in accommodation are not confined to any one part of the country. They include large hospitals in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other centres and extensions of hospitals in several parts of the country.  While the present hospital building programme was not intended to be the final answer to this country's requirements, the implementation will certainly mean that the new scheme will not be unworkable because of shortage of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The position as regards the dispensaries is that there are at present 621 main dispensaries and 392 dispensary depôts in the country.  Three hundred and thirty of the dispensaries and 158 of the dispensary depôts have been reported on as unsuitable.  In May last year I tried a new approach which, I thought should bring about a big improvement in dispensaries.  I had a few slightly different versions of a simple standard plan for dispensaries prepared and sent to the local authorities, and I undertook to pay grants up to £600 towards the cost of each <Col N="1903" /> new dispensary built in accordance with those plans.  With this incentive, the local authorities have undertaken to erect 294 new dispensaries or dispensary depôts.  Some of these are actually in process of being built at present.  Most will replace bad old buildings and I trust that all the present unsuitable dispensaries will be replaced within a few years.  I will, of course, continue to press local authorities to replace or improve unsuitable dispensary buildings as soon as possible. In addition, there is a programme for the provision of county clinics, at least one in each county, which will be on a much more elaborate scale than the dispensaries. These clinics will function as diagnostic and treatment centres for ailments which are beyond the capacity of the dispensaries.</P>
    <P>The story, of course, does not end with buildings.  Equipment is being provided to match the buildings; and experience has demonstrated that adequate trained personnel, medical, nursing and ancillary, of the highest possible calibre is available to provide the services as quickly as the facilities are provided.  In particular, I would like to refer to the professional personnel recruited through the medium of the Local Appointments Commission.  They are all highly qualified and fitted to take their places in well-planned and properly equipped hospitals.  Their work is first-class; in fact, so obviously good that the prejudice against provincial institutions has within a few years given way to a feeling of pride and confidence amongst the rural population generally.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that my Department has been more kind to local authority than to voluntary hospitals, that in fact, we have starved the voluntary hospitals and treated the local authority institutions as prodigal sons.  An examination of the figures will not support that view, and it cannot be sustained as a reason for the growing popularity of the county hospitals.  The method of appointment to professional vacancies, a method which ensures that the sole consideration is merit, has in my <Col N="1904" /> opinion been responsible for the striking success of those institutions.</P>
    <P>Another point to remember is that more people will not get sick because there is a scheme in operation.  People normally will not be admitted to hospital except on the recommendation of a doctor and the suggestion that the scheme is going to cause overcrowding of the hospitals can only mean one of two things&mdash;that there are many people in need of hospital treatment who cannot afford it or do not get it at present, or that doctors will certify that persons need hospital treatment when in fact they do not.  It should also be remembered that any alternative scheme suggested would not produce facilities any more quickly than the present proposals.</P>
    <P>Another argument which is being used against the extension of services now proposed is that the extension will give rise to breaches of medical secrecy.  It is hard to have patience with this sort of humbug.  For decades the dispensary doctors have been dealing day in and day out with one-third of the country's population, attending to their every ailment and illness and sending them to local authority hospitals when they had not the facilities for treatment in the dispensary or at home.  Can any Deputy here say that in the course of his close contact with the public he has heard any complaint of breach of medical secrecy?  Some critics give the impression that medical secrecy is in danger now when people outside the lower income group are concerned.  A &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; infectious diseases diagnostic and treatment service has been in operation now for some years and has been availed of by all sections of the community, without distinction as to income, and here again there is no suggestion that medical secrecy is being infringed.  The few lay officials of the local authority who have access to those records have something to do other than to take the morbid interest in these records that critics of the scheme would ascribe to them.</P>
    <P>For more than 40 years doctors every day have been signing National Health Insurance certificates telling <Col N="1905" /> the lay staff in Arus Brugha or elsewhere exactly what is wrong with their patients.  There was no complaint about medical secrecy.  One can only conclude that the importance of medical secrecy increases with the means of the patient or with the critics' hostility to a particular scheme.  I have called a meeting of the Health Council and if practical suggestions are made on this question of secrecy they will get my careful and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There are really only two extentions of services of any importance in this scheme, viz., hospital services for the middle income group and maternity services for the lower and middle income groups.  In the former case the family doctor will recommend his patient for hospital treatment and the health authority (i.e., the county manager) will make the necessary arrangements&mdash;exactly what he does now for people in the lower income group.  Must we make different regulations for this more wealthy category? In the case of maternity the doctor will be asked to sign a prescribed form to prove he has actually looked after his patient before he is paid by the local authority.  If he is the dispensary doctor he also fills in the registration of birth and sends it to the superintendent registrar.  He has always done this latter act and has never been accused of violating medical secrecy.</P>
    <P>Incidentally I cannot see any consistency between the attitude of the Irish Medical Association towards this question of medical secrecy in relation to the present proposed service and their action in pressing the Minister for Social Welfare in 1949 to arrange for the continuance of a scheme for the treatment of British ex-servicemen which specifically provides that the doctors would, to quote from the scheme, &ldquo;adopt such procedure, obey such instructions, keep such records and furnish such information as may be required by the Ministry of Pensions or the Minister&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;Ministry of Pensions&rdquo; is, of course, the British Ministry and the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is the Irish Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Another argument against the proposed <Col N="1906" /> extension of services is that it will destroy the doctor-patient relationship. I have dealt with this argument fully elsewhere, and all I propose to say here is that it is a poor tribute to the integrity of doctors to imply that they will give a worse service to a patient who is paid for by another than to the patient who pays the doctor direct himself.  I appear to have a higher opinion of the members of the profession than its own association has, and I think my opinion will be shared by every Deputy in this House.  I believe that the great majority of dispensary doctors, county surgeons and doctors in sanatoria have given good service even though they are paid by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The cry of &ldquo;State medicine&rdquo; has been raised.  Picture a Minister in the Custom House directing a gang of bureaucrats&mdash;or worse still, of bureaucrats acting independently of the Minister&mdash;interfering with the medical profession in their relations with patients.  I have asked for examples of such interference, but have failed to get more than one.  Past experience in this matter is a good guide to what is going to happen in the future.  Every dispensary doctor knows that he can give his dispensary patient as good a level of treatment as he can give to his private patient, and better in many cases, because he can give drugs and treatments which he would hesitate to prescribe for his private patient on grounds of cost.  Every county surgeon and county physician knows that nobody will question his treatment of any patient except on the grounds that he has been negligent or neglectful. The numerous doctors working as full-time employees of local authorities in in tuberculosis hospitals and sanatoria can tell the same story.  The one example I have referred to was that county surgeons are not allowed to go outside the hospital on consultations. Now this limitation was introduced because it was found that the privilege, when granted, had sometimes been abused and in any case in which the limitation applies the surgeon accepted the post knowing this was amongst his conditions of appointment.  It is a poor example, but presumably the best that can be found to support a poor case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> Incidentally I might mention that I tried very hard recently when discussing the conditions of appointment of a surgeon to persuade a local authority to give him more freedom for private practice, but I was strenuously opposed and, of course, I gave in. This is not a State scheme.  I have said that more than once, but I have made no impression on those who are more interested in propaganda than truth.</P>

      <P>I am told that the scheme would interfere with the autonomy of the voluntary hospitals.  Here again I have not been told how.  The voluntary hospitals have been treating patients on a contract basis for health authorities, public assistance authorities and the National Health Insurance authorities for years without any danger to their autonomy.  That position will not be changed under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medical Association, which has sponsored many of the foregoing objections, has agreed that there should be an extension and improvement of the health services and towards this end have produced a scheme of voluntary insurance.  Now, the principle of voluntary health insurance is not new.  I had considered it as means of providing a health service years before the association issued their scheme.  It has been tried in various countries over a long number of years, but in no country has it been successful in providing full medical care for more than a portion of the population, and in many countries where it has been tried it has been abandoned or its scope has been reduced.  A voluntary insurance scheme might serve a useful purpose for a limited number of persons, and I have intimated to the Irish Medical Association that I see no objection to its sponsoring a scheme of voluntary insurance for those who are not covered by, or who do not wish to avail themselves of, the Government's <Col N="1908" /> proposals for improved and extended health services.  I am perfectly satisfied, however, that voluntary insurance, State-aided or otherwise, is an impracticable method of providing a health service for the country generally. There are cogent reasons for this conclusion.</P>
    <P>The first of these is that it would cover only a portion of the population and it would be necessary to provide cover for the remainder by other means.  This would result in an unnecessary and wasteful duplication of services.</P>
    <P>In reaching the conclusion that a voluntary insurance scheme would cover only a portion of the population, I must have regard not only to the classification of the population in this country where such a large proportion, including the farming community, is self-employed but also to the experience of other countries in regard to voluntary insurance.</P>
    <P>Next, a principle of insurance is that benefit is paid only to those who have paid up their insurance contributions. The provision of medical care should depend on medical need and not on whether a person is in benefit or not. A person cannot be allowed to die or even to do without medical care because he or she has, possibly for some good reason, failed to take out insurance or to keep up the payment of premiums.  On the other hand, if persons could obtain medical care, whether they were insured or not, there would be no reason why they should insure.</P>
    <P>Another reason is that the people most likely to join a voluntary insurance scheme are those who can readily pay the premium involved&mdash;leaving many of those to whom the payment of the premium might be a hardship without any provision for medical care unless a separate scheme to deal with them is in operation.  The improvident person will not insure and neither will he be able to pay for his medical treatment, but whether improvident or undeserving some provision must be made to look after him.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason is that the cost of administration of a voluntary insurance <Col N="1909" /> scheme would be high&mdash;particularly in this country where such a considerable proportion of the people live outside the large centres of population. The association states that the cost of administering its scheme would not be as high as in what it describes as a &ldquo;State administered scheme&rdquo;.  By this I presume they mean a scheme administered by a local authority.  This is a fine example of &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo;. The cost of administration in the local authority health services is about 4 or 5 per cent.  It is simply fantastic to think that an insurance scheme could be run at so low a cost.</P>
    <P>Finally, the cost of changing over from the present system would be considerable.  The association has ignored this cost, although it demands that the existing rights of all local authority doctors must be preserved. The dispensary doctor might have all his medical assistance patients taken from him but he would still draw the salary payable for his dispensary duties.  I would be prepared to face up to this cost if I thought the scheme was a good one; but it is not.  In the scheme as submitted to me, the association gave no indication as to the amount which would be paid in any particular set of circumstances. In a published brochure it talks of £200 for 1/4.  Actually the insurance company would pay benefits at such rates and in such circumstances, not defined beforehand, as it thought fit and only after a waiting period, again undefined.  The brochure gives the impression that all a person has to do, for instance, is to go into the most expensive nursing home and have his maintenance and medical fees paid up to a limit of £100.  The brochure also states that a maternity benefit of from £15 to £25 would be paid in any year. It is regrettable that any responsible body should have issued a document which would probably have landed a &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; share pusher in gaol.</P>
    <P>The voluntary insurance scheme, as provided in this Bill, is not only defensible but I believe desirable.  It applies to a class who can pay their own expenses if they do not adopt the scheme.  They are free to accept or reject it, and it can, therefore, be truly described as voluntary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> Taking the average number of births per married couple per year the income from contributions should cover at least 50 per cent. of the total cost which is the normal figure arrived at in a contributory scheme sponsored by the State.  It is, therefore, a contributory insurance scheme.  I want to assure Deputies that it is a serious attempt to arrive at a fair compromise between the higher income group on the one hand and the taxpayers and ratepayers on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The young married man with a salary exceeding £600 often finds it hard to balance his income against his expenses.  Many a young man entering matrimony is over-optimistic in considering his future prospects.  He borrows the purchase money for a house, perhaps buys furniture on the hire-purchase system, perhaps by the same means buys a car as a necessary requirement for his job.  He then finds it impossible or at least difficult to meet maternity bills, and with each arrival his embarrassment is intensified. He should not be tempted to economise by avoiding medical advice. Our mortality experience is already too high.  He must not be allowed to resort to the cynical conclusion that he cannot afford a family.  I feel that an unanswerable case can be made for helping such cases and I believe that the contributory scheme supplies the need.</P>
    <P>There is another proposal in the Bill which I refrained from mentioning until now because it escaped the criticisms which were levelled at other provisions. In fact, it has been welcomed everywhere.  That is the provision authorising local authorities to initiate schemes of rehabilitation of chronically disabled persons and to pay maintenance allowances in certain circumstances. The need for these services has been felt for a long time and certain schemes, which are excellent but of only limited application, have been initiated by public-spirited citizens.  Great credit is due to these citizens and it will be my constant endeavour, and I am sure the endeavour of local authorities, to foster, encourage and assist such schemes.  Something more is needed, <Col N="1911" /> however, and the power to do that something more is now being taken in Section 45.  The precise form which rehabilitation measures will take has not yet been determined but I visualise local authorities providing the medical facilities for rehabilitation and the necessary training, with local committees in each area advising on courses of instruction and seeking openings for the rehabilitated person under the general direction and guidance of a national rehabilitation organisation.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the cost of all these improved and extended services.  As I have said in reply to parliamentary questions in this House, and to various deputations I have met outside, I cannot say with any degree of accuracy what the additional cost will be.  It will depend on the rapidity with which the services are brought into operation in the various areas, the extent to which they are availed of, the extent to which local authorities make charges for hospital treatment to persons in the middle income class and the financial arrangements entered into with the persons and bodies who will provide services under the various schemes.  My estimate is that £1,800,000 should cover the additional annual cost of the services provided in the Bill, not in the White Paper, when they are in full operation. This figure must be taken with a certain amount of reserve, but it is an honest estimate and is not deliberately written down.  I will be told that my estimate must inevitably be too low because the cost of the health services in Britain considerably exceeded the estimate.  I do not accept that argument because we seem to have arrived at a measure of stability in the matter of prices and salary and wage rates and because our scheme here is of more limited application than the British scheme and we have more data to go on than they had, including fairly complete information as to their experience. It is of interest to mention that a few critics have painted a lurid picture of the colossal waste and expenditure which would be involved in issuing free medicines.  There has <Col N="1912" /> been no proposal either in the White Paper or in the Bill to issue free medicines except to those who are already entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to give the House details of the manner in which my figure was arrived at but in doing so I would have to disclose what I have in mind for certain services which will be subject to negotiation with persons and bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>It is taken for granted that this figure of cost is an additional impost on the public.  In the absence of the scheme the persons concerned would continue to pay directly for medical and ancillary services and possibly pay more than would be paid under the scheme.  The fact too that a person is kept healthy and able to work or that, having become ill, he is sooner restored to health, will add to the productive capacity of the community.</P>
    <P>Nothing has given rise to so much controversy as the question whether that estimated annual sum of £1,800,000 should be borne by the Exchequer or by the local authority, or shared by both.  Up to the time of the passage of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, only 16 per cent. of the cost of health services was borne by the Exchequer.  Under that Act, the whole financial system was changed and the new arrangement was that the Exchequer would bear the full amount of any increase in current expenditure over the local expenditure in the standard year, 1947-48, until the Exchequer was paying as much as was paid from the rates, and when that stage was reached the local authorities and the Exchequer would contribute 50-50.  I feel that the financial arrangements set out in the Act represent a fair distribution of the cost of health services between the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  For six years rates have increased substantially all over the country, but health charges have remained constant as far as the ratepayer is concerned.  When this Bill is fully implemented in three or four years' time from now, the rates may, as a result, have increased by 1/6.  Take a farmer of £40 poor law valuation.  His cost will be £3 less relief from agricultural grant, i.e., less than ½ per <Col N="1913" /> week.  For this he is assured of specialist and hospital treatment for himself and his family and free maternity service for his wife&mdash;a good investment compared to a nebulous insurance scheme.  As well as that, he contributes to rehabilitation for his unfortunate neighbour and to a maternity grant for the wife of his workman.  The farmer of £20 poor law valuation&mdash;and he represents the great majority&mdash;will get all these benefits for 7d. per week &mdash;the price of five cigarettes.  I have considered this whole question very carefully, and I am satisfied that I would not be justified in recommending to the House that it should alter the financial provisions laid down in the 1947 Act.  Consequently, the additional cost to local authorities of the new services when in full operation will be about £900,000.  I should explain here that the increase will be gradual and the full charge will not materialise for some years.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment to the Second Reading standing over the name of Deputy O'Higgins.  It cannot be regarded as a serious contribution. In 1947, after the Health Act of that year was passed, the Government issued a White Paper outlining its intentions with regard to the future provision of health services.  Shortly afterwards the Coalition Government came in and it decided to proceed with the major part of these proposals.  The history of what subsequently occurred is so vivid in our minds that we cannot forget the great betrayal by that Government. The present Government has again taken up its proposals for 1947 and is asking the Dáil to approve of them.  An inquiry by the Oireachtas or by the Dáil is only justified and usually only sought on a complicated measure where issues are not fully understood, but here we have had five years of acute controversy and every Deputy is able to decide for himself. The issues involved in any Health Bill should be clear to him but especially in a Bill that does not depart in principle from what every Party in the House has approved under the responsibility of office.  It is not an honest amendment.  Nobody wants a Dáil and <Col N="1914" /> Seanad inquiry, least of all Fine Gael, and neither do they want the production of documents dealing with previous Health Bills.  It may be a way of evading a decision to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It may be a bid for a combined Opposition vote.  It may be anything except what it purports to be and it is, therefore, a sham and a humbug.  I ask every honest Deputy, therefore, to reject the amendment.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents, as I have said, the Government's considered view on the nature, scope and form of the extended services.  That is not to say that I regard it as final or perfect and I will consider carefully and sympathetically any suggestions made for its improvement.  One amendment which has already been suggested to me will be introduced at Committee Stage in reference to Section 18.  I propose to amend the provisions of that section in regard to secondary schools to bring them more into line with the corresponding provisions of the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>In every statement issued in connection with these proposals, it has been emphasised that all of them cannot be brought into operation immediately. I want to repeat that warning now.  Some time must elapse before all the necessary facilities are available and all the necessary arrangements made, but there will be no deliberate holding back on my part. Neither do I intend to push local authorities unduly to implement the Bill.  I intend within reason to allow the maximum discretion to local authorities.  When the proposals are fully implemented, I think we will have health services of a reasonably high order and that the community will benefit very substantially from the better standard of health that we can expect and from the increased productive capacity which will result from that improved standard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, while of opinion that improvement and extension of the health services are necessary, <Col N="1915" /> declines to give a Second Reading to the Health Bill, 1952, until it receives a report on the Bill from a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad having power to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
    <P>The meaning of the amendment is, of course, clear but the reasons for it have to be stated.  One of the reasons was supplied by the Minister in his closing remarks, this unnecessary offensiveness in dealing with health matters, the Minister and predecessors constituting themselves as prosecuting counsel, judge and jury and being the sole deciders not only of what they think but what is in the mind of everybody else.</P>
    <P>That amendment was put down because health legislation in this country and attempts at health legislation for ten years back have been associated with controversy, acrimony, bitterness, bad blood and bad feeling. It is because that is the atmosphere there to-night, as anyone can see from the offensive and insulting observation of the Minister, that, I think, decent men and women would subscribe to the view that we should delay controversial legislation for a bit to let the atmosphere clear and meantime get on with the improvements that are crying out for attention and about which nothing has been done.  Talk, Bills, White Papers, long-range abusive speeches from Wexford to Merrion Square, every contribution worsening the state of affairs between the Minister and the only people that can be called upon to work this health measure or any other health measure.  In that state of affairs would not any decent person say: &ldquo;Hold off your legislation. Stop your long-range abusive speeches. Let the scribes that are around you not dip their pens so often in ink and try to link together, whether through Deputies, Senators or others, the only people who will be called upon to work, the only people who can work, this scheme?&rdquo; That is one reason for putting down this motion.</P>
    <P>Surely there is sticking out a case for a tribunal, some tribunal, to ascertain the facts, to find out what the <Col N="1916" /> situation is, to find out whether the Minister is right when he comes here and says that members of my profession and his should be in jail as bucket-shop shysters, or whether the Minister is correct in saying that members of his profession and mine, when they sit down to study the health requirements of this country, are instigated by lowdown political motives?  As long as that atmosphere exists, is it necessary for anyone to have to make the case for any form of delaying action with regard to legislation?</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he cut out from his office, rambled around and met a few county councillors.  Because he met a few county councillors, he changed his views, changed them very considerably.  The White Paper of last June had to be amended very considerably because he rambled around and met a few county councillors; he found he had a lot to learn.  Is that not a strong case for some kind of a fact-finding tribunal that will have power to send for people?  Perhaps if he met a few more people other than the county councillors he met, he would change his mind on other important points.  Perhaps if he met in a friendly atmosphere representatives of the people who know all about this from A to Z&mdash;members of the medical profession, members of the nursing profession, members of the profession of dentistry&mdash;possibly and probably he would change his views on a great number of other aspects.</P>
    <P>A motion such as this, according to the Minister, could not be put forward by anybody with honesty and sincerity. Any impartial person, following the events associated with this question for the last 18 months, certainly will not give to the Minister a monopoly of the honesty of this country in his approach to this particular question. Take the Minister's speech to-day. What was it about? I wondered, listening to the Minister, what we were discussing. I wondered whether we were discussing this Bill or whether we were just having a general chat about health matters in this country.  The Minister outlined a number of things which would either be done or he hoped would be done.  So far as I <Col N="1917" /> could follow the Minister, the things to which he referred, such as better dispensaries, more equipment, child welfare clinics, the building of hospitals, the extension of other hospitals, augmented nursing services, are there as the law of the land for many years back, most of them long before the Minister's time as Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department time and time again vetoed any effort for augmentation of staff and turned down applications for more assistance. No legislation is required, or was required, for the things the Minister outlined here.  You do not want this Bill to build new dispensaries.  At least in half your dispensaries no man with a professional sense would amputate a puppy's tail.  You did not have to wait for this Bill and you did not have to wait and bedevil the relations between the Department of Health and the Irish medical profession in order to improve the dispensaries.  Reports and applications have gone in year after year.</P>
    <P>The powers are there and money is being spent like water all around the place.  You can get ahead with that. The public health service in this country has been starved by the Minister's Department practically from the very beginning.  More work could be done if there were more people to do the work.  Clinics could be started, multiplied and extended if the staff were there.  How many applications were granted and how many rejected even in the Minister's time, or certainly in the time of his Government? No legislation is required for anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, so far as I can see, the only item to which he referred that required special legislation was that extending maternity attendance and hospital attendance on maternity cases for people within a certain income level who paid an annual fee.  There was very little more than that.  Why is that work not being done? Why at this hour of the day, ten years after the first Health Bill, the forerunner of this, was introduced, is no progress being made?  Why is there nothing but fighting propaganda, controversy, political catch-cries and the <Col N="1918" /> smart kind of observations we had to-night?  The Minister accused his medical colleagues of being stimulated by political motives when they put up their scheme and when they put up their objections to his.  The Minister has a very short memory.  Did the Minister not know that it was the very same people who opposed another scheme put up by the Government opposed to himself?  Was it political motives inspired them then?  The Minister knows that of the hierarchy of that body, small in numbers, three or four of them have been candidates alongside the Minister in the political warfare of this country.  He accused those men of having no conscience submerging the views of their profession and their medical conscience to make political difficulties for any Government that comes along whether one of their own political conviction or not. You have this kind of speech made and that kind of statement made and all just worsening the position.</P>
    <P>It is better for us to get back to beginnings and see how these efforts at health legislation originated.  Away back 14 years ago this much abused body of professional men, the Irish Medical Association, moving around the city and country, saw the conditions under which the sick, extern and intern, had to be treated and saw the position with regard to those who required hospital attention with costs of living increasing.  Knowing that it was a very grave hardship and a great weight on all our people above the dispensary level who had to go to hospital when illness struck, they put up to the Department of Health proposals for better health services.  They pointed out all the deficiencies.  They pointed out the limitations, and suggested that some aid or some help in some shape or form should be given to those people so that, when illness struck them, it would not be associated with bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>As a result of what they saw we had the Health Bill of 1945, the Bill that many Deputies here remember.  That Bill was called a Health Bill.  It was a policeman's Bill by which the practice of medicine would be carried on under the shadow of a policeman's baton.  If <Col N="1919" /> a passenger on a bus saw a passenger at the other end of the bus with a pimple on his nose, he could say: &ldquo;I suspect that person to have a contagious or infectious disease.&rdquo;  That person would be arrested and taken away for examination.  Servants could say: &ldquo;I suspect that there is an infectious disease in Mrs. Mulligan's house,&rdquo; and at any time of the day or night the health inspectors could invade that home.  That was the policy of the same Government that is there now.</P>
    <P>That Bill was put through as an urgent measure in this House.  The more we opposed it, the greater was the effort to force it through.  We were threatened with having to sit through Holy Week because the Bill was so urgently required.  And what happened? A miracle happened or we would be suffering as a result of that Bill to-day. A miracle happened.  The pigs of Ireland came to the rescue of the people of Ireland.  The Monaghan bacon factory sensation blew up and, as a result, the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Bill retired.  It had no connection with the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already, Sir, gone extensively into the history and background of this.  Like a child, I am following in the Minister's footsteps.  It had no connection with the Bill, but the same Government was there and the Bill never came back, but, in 1947, we had another Bill which was very different from the first Bill. The policy had changed almost completely. Most of the very, very objectionable features had disappeared, others had been modified, others whittled down, but that was the Government policy in 1947.  That Bill went through the House as the last charter of good health for the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That same Government came back again 18 months ago and a Bill was drafted.  Their policy had changed. We got a White Paper last summer with a lot of very far-reaching proposals in it.  That White Paper was <Col N="1920" /> circulated as the last word in Government policy.  Those were many changes in a few years, but that was only last summer.</P>
    <P>Then last month we found that White Paper was so much scrap.  The Government had changed its mind, and now we have a different set of proposals entirely, a new White Paper, a new Bill, and all the changes brought about because the Minister says he met some people here and there, and, as a result of meeting those few people here and there, he changed his mind. He now scoffs at a suggestion that he should meet a few more and then he would, perhaps, get down to a Bill that would be generally acceptable.</P>
    <P>Let anybody look at the foundations of the medical services of this country. I think we have as sound, healthy foundations as you could have in any country in the world.  A chance should be given to see what is there first. We should see what is there before we launch out on a revolutionary piece of legislation resulting in controversy and animosity, and at the end of it all have the health services of the country carried out either by a blackleg brigade or by a disgruntled sour and beaten body of medical men and to think that by going that road you will improve the health services of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Take our dispensary services.  The personnel that we have there is second to none.  I believe that the dispensary doctor and the general practitioner are second to none in the world fulfilling the same or much the same function and keeping themselves up to date.  They are very, very excellent men, hard working, honest, and popular, loved and respected by their people but suffering under limitations that would break the heart of many people.  They have unsuitable premises and, perhaps, 90 per cent. of the dispensaries are without running water of any kind.  They may have a room rented in a family house with no facilities for patients and no examination facilities.  They are limited in the way of instruments and drugs.</P>
    <P>All those things are crying out for improvement and nothing is being done about it.  Again, you have the county <Col N="1921" /> hospitals and again you have a certain amount of progress but they are suffering from inadequacies of one kind or another.  Any number of improvements could be made without any legislation whatsoever.  Then there is the public health service and in most counties they show no development whatsoever over a long period of 20 years.</P>
    <P>We have our school children being inspected every fourth and fifth year, when it should be done every year; one man, possibly, to look after all the tuberculosis cases of a county; one sometimes two, nurses to cover all the work of a county; one, or no child welfare clinic.  We have all those things there crying for extension and improvement, requiring no legislation&mdash;and nothing whatever being done.  Then, on top of all that, we have this legislation, this succession of White Papers, this long range controversial speech making, this bitter letter writing, these smart and cutting remarks that we heard to-night&mdash;and no attempt whatever to come to an arrangement with the various classes of doctors&mdash; dispensary men, hospital men, specialists, public health men&mdash;nothing but just roll through a Bill and then we will talk turkey to them.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is still in this House a keen sense of justice.  I put it to the Minister, if it is worth putting to him at this stage, to consider those dispensary men down the country. They are working for a salary that barely runs their car, they are making a living out of what fees they get&mdash; some years are good and some are bad.  I do not believe any one of us saw one of that class die worth any money at all.  The medical benevolent fund shows the draws every year where one of those men dies comparatively young; they are small grants&mdash;as small as £20&mdash;to the widows, showing how badly they are left.  Then you have a Minister coming in and taking powers to take away a big lot of such a man's private practice.  That is all right&mdash; compensation can be given in one way or another&mdash;but surely decency and good business would direct that these arrangements should be made in advance.  Personally, I never saw any attitude on the part of the medical <Col N="1922" /> men beyond a desire for a settlement. I saw bungling, mishandling, long-range speeches rather than talks around the conference table.</P>
    <P>Then we go higher up the line, and who are the men picked out for abuse? The specialists and others functioning in our voluntary hospitals, men working all the forenoon, every day in the week, free, no payment, giving their skill in the public wards.  Deputy McGrath smiles.</P>

      <P>That is the constitution of our voluntary hospitals.  In the afternoon they are working elsewhere and making their bit as best they can. Here, again, you have no discussions with them&mdash;none whatsoever.  The Minister is going to take powers and then wade in, tell them all just what they are to do, when they will do it and what they will get&mdash;if anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main part of this propaganda revolves around the mother and child. Speeches, statements and propaganda hold out the picture of every woman who is going to have a baby, getting hospital attention, and getting it free. The Minister gave figures here this evening, and I am going to give the Minister's figures as given to me in reply to a Dáil question.  I asked, as given in columns 233-34 of the debate for the 23rd October, 1952, for the number of maternity beds in public wards in the year 1952, and I got back a reply that the number in local authority hospitals was 604 and in voluntary hospitals 350, making a total of 954.  In addition to those, you had 281 beds in local authority hospitals reserved for unmarried mothers.  The Minister gave a figure this evening of 11,000.  I asked him if it included the beds reserved for unmarried mothers. I asked him was he referring to maternity beds in public wards.  He <Col N="1923" /> said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and the number he gave was 11,000.  The number is 954.  The total average birth rate which he gave this evening is 63,000.  The average number of births over the last ten years is 65,500.  The distribution of beds is as follows: In Dublin altogether, for a birth rate of 15,800 a year, there are 234+17=251 beds.  In the country, the number of beds varies. In ten of the counties, there are under ten in each.  The number goes up as far as 24.  The average is about 12, while the average birth rate is about 1,200.</P>
    <P>In the City of Dublin, and that is the best provided of all, you have 234 beds for 16,000 births.  Anyone associated with maternity work in the city will tell you that the infant mortality rate could be considerably reduced if it were possible to keep delicate mothers and delicate infants longer in hospital following the birth, but the necessity is to roll them out as quickly as possible to make vacancies for others. That is the position in Dublin.  Take the neighbouring counties.  Take County Kildare, where there are eight maternity beds for a birth rate of about 1,300 per annum.</P>
    <P>Nobody can get into a bed in most of our counties, except those cases which are certified as abnormal cases, or, alternatively, those cases which the doctor certifies to be cases in which there are likely to be complications. I believe it should be possible for any woman about to have a baby to have her baby in hospital.  I do not think it is fair to the mother, to the infant or to the family that that event should take place in the home.  Most of the homes are definitely unsuitable, but at the present moment&mdash;and this is where I come in direct conflict with the Minister and his Bill&mdash;in the field of maternity the conditions existing are so appallingly bad that even good service cannot be given to the poor.  We are going to lump in on top of them potentially everybody else who queues up, and the beds remain the same.  Is that honest?  Is the propaganda behind it honest and is that a state of affairs that it is right to bring about?  That is the reason, or one of the reasons, <Col N="1924" /> why this motion is before the House Improve what you have; do what you can; delay your legislation and do not say to people: &ldquo;You are going to get these facilities&rdquo;, when they are going to get the door banged in their faces when they go in to look for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister approaches this Bill in a way in which I think I have never seen a Minister approach a Bill before. He comes in here, seven years after the parent Bill, very many years after his Government assumed charge of the affairs of the country and ten years after this has been a rather hectic subject of political discussion and debate and cannot give us anything even approaching a figure as to what it is going to cost.  He ambles in late in the day and gives us a figure which might be reached in a few years' time and says: &ldquo;On the way I reckon it, it will come to about 1/6 in the £ on the rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister gets his information, but I do know that 1d. in the £ in different counties brings in a very different amount.  In some counties, a 1d. in the £ will bring in £4,000; in other counties, it will bring in about £600; and in others, it may bring in £1,000.  When the Minister talks of the scheme costing 1/6 in the £, what type of county is he talking about?  Granted that populations are the same in any two counties in which the scheme is developed, the cost of development is going to be exactly the same in the poor county as in the wealthy county, but obviously the rate in the £ is going to be very different.</P>
    <P>This Bill, its introduction and the lead-up to it, has on it the stamp of not having been seriously considered, not having been carefully thought out &mdash;no investigation, no inquiry and no spadework and introduced here in the spirit of a man who says: &ldquo;We have a Health Bill which is hanging around here.  There was a burst-up about it a couple of years ago and every time it is touched, there is a burst-up.  I must introduce something to get it out of the way so that I can forget about it.&rdquo; His speech here to-night indicates his intentions.  He is going to pass the Bill by virtue of the number of votes behind him, and, having passed the <Col N="1925" /> Bill, he calls attention to Section 63 and says: &ldquo;I am passing the Bill, boys, but that is the end of it, so far as I am concerned.  I am not going to touch it any further&mdash;hands off; if any county council goes the rest of the road, well and good and good luck to them, but I am not going to urge them or put pressure on them.&rdquo;  What is all the fuss about?  Is a nod not as good as a wink to a blind horse?  Does he not know that the introduction of the Bill is just the piling of another bit of green paper on all the green paper and all the White Papers we have been handling for years back?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the most marked feature of our discussions on health services has been the fact that they have been between the Minister for the time being and the medical profession, between political Parties and political personalities, and it does seem time that we remembered that, outside of the medical profession and the various Ministers from time to time and various Parties and personalities, there are people in this country who are sick and require attention.  For that reason, it seems that, whether we feel that what has gone before this Bill is in all its aspects satisfactory or not, it is time for some body of the nature of this House to try to bring to an end that unsatisfactory situation. Frankly, I cannot see it being brought to an end by any bodies or persons external to the House, even though the House itself may not find itself in the happiest atmosphere for dealing with such an important matter.</P>
      <P>So far as the Labour Party are concerned, their anxiety to secure for our people the type of health services that, quite naturally and clearly, are required, is not and cannot be questioned, and it has been recorded on many occasions; but in so far as the approach to the provision of these services is concerned, we have had so much free advice, not merely from persons directly concerned with health services and with politics but even from the many amateur theological societies outside the House that one is apt to become lost in the maze of words that has grown up around this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1926" /> It seems to me that, whatever else may be our differences, there are at least three spheres in which there are certain fundamental claims of the citizens and of the individual in respect of which there should be no other consideration but the merit of the particular claim or need.  Certainly in these spheres the last thing that should enter into consideration is the question of cash or money.  There is, first, the spiritual sphere and, secondly, the sphere we are dealing with to-night of life and death and the intervening years when life and death are in the balance and, finally, there is the sphere of justice and law.  During all recent years, when we have been discussing this subject, the one thing we seem to have lost sight of is that it is health we are discussing and not the question of money, cash or the professional claims of any profession.  I have a great regard for doctors.  Personally, I feel that in many ways the doctor gives greater service to the community than a member of any other profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that in many ways we fail to give the proper respect and credit to doctors to which they are entitled.  I feel it would be objectionable on my part to imagine that a doctor was concerned with anything else except the welfare of his patient and the reasonable and necessary security that he requires as a citizen to conduct his profession.  Therefore, I think we should exclude, at least from the principle of our approach to health, such considerations as seem to have been included in this matter up to the moment.  Also, if we are dealing with such a question as health, we must have not merely a philosophical approach but also a social approach. Health is like many other basic needs and rights that are due to a member of the community because of membership of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not question the basis on which we provide police protection for the community or water <Col N="1927" /> and sewerage services, or education in its elementary form.  Therefore, it seems to me that, so far as health is concerned, we should have the same broad approach and that the questions of finance and administration should not be regarded as the guiding principle but only the ordinary limitations that anybody comes up against from a practical point of view in trying to give effect to what is desirable and justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is largely the administrative and financial aspects that have been brought to the fore and the social aspect and the aspect of individual rights as citizens that have been placed in the background.  If we are, even now, to try and get the consideration in respect of the health of our people which is required we must try and break with the type of discussion we had in the past.  The approach of the Labour movement to this question has always been that proper health services should be provided by the community as a broad community service, not merely because it is in the interests of the community but because it is the only feasible and practical way in the light of modern developments.  We have frequently been told that the proper way is to enable the individual citizen so to earn his livelihood that he can discharge his family obligations.  That is a very nice ideal and it is one to which probably many of us in this House would subscribe, but it is an ideal and it will be an ideal for many a long day yet.  Consider the position of even those more fortunate members of the community for whom medical attention has not to be limited by their income or purse.  The very developments that have taken place in medicine in recent years place many modern techniques outside the purse of many of the wealthier citizens. These techniques and the care and attention that are required can, in fact, be provided only on a social and community basis.  The best that we can provide in health services should be made available to the sick person without the application of any test in advance and regardless of whether or <Col N="1928" /> not he is a pauper or a rich man.  We should deal with the question of income in an entirely different way and at a different level.  This is most important.</P>
    <P>Many criticisms have been directed against the present British health scheme.  I have some personal knowledge of it.  I recall the case of an individual suffering from a very dangerous disease and in immediate danger of death.  Through that medical scheme, he received a course of treatment in which the drugs alone cost £1,500, and without any question being raised in any way of the entitlement of that person to that treatment.  The attitude was that that person was sick and that there was no other course to be adopted.  That, to my mind, justifies the scheme.  The treatment that was given to that individual could not have been given to him and would not have been available to any other person in the United Kingdom on the basis of income or wealth.  It could be provided only by a social scheme with all the facilities and all the authority of the State behind it.  There are many similar instances&mdash;even to the extent of individual citizens of our country crossing the Irish Sea to receive special treatment in the United Kingdom which they could not secure in this country except at a cost far beyond their means.</P>
    <P>In recent discussions, the Labour Party indicated that we felt that while the broad approach is the ideal approach, at the same time a very strong case could be made for seeking to base our approach to a proper health service on the broad system of insurance&mdash;not that we felt that that in itself was justified but because we realised that our present system, particularly of administration and the provision of funds by the central Government is subject to the ebb and flow of the political tide and that the placing of the individual's claim on an insurance basis provided some measure of security and continuity of financial provisions.  That has been the approach made generally and accepted generally in regard to the other fields of communal assistance; it has been the approach in respect of economic needs <Col N="1929" /> in the form of unemployment assistance, sick pay and so forth.  Possibly, special provisions could have been made for certain sections of the community, but such provisions could also be made within the general broad scope of the insurance principle.</P>
    <P>We felt that, to the extent that the type of service now required in order to provide a proper health scheme in respect of general practitioner service, clinical service, and so forth, could properly be provided only through the medium of developing a local authority administrative machine, it should be a State scheme.  I am not one of those who feel that everything that is touched by a civil servant or by a servant or an employee of a local authority must automatically be condemned. We fail to realise that whenever a service is provided by the State or the local authority which we personally or as a group appreciate, then the civil servant or the employee or the local authority is to be commended &mdash;but if we personally are not receiving the benefits of that particular service then it is subject to criticism, and the good intentions and efficiency of the person administering it are questioned and brought into dispute.  On the whole, I think the standard of service given by those who administer the many branches of our communal machine in this country is high and is to be commended.  If there are any defects, they are largely of our making in this House when we pass the legislation. We find the same difficulty in the Bill which is before the House at the present time.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of finance.  I have indicated that our view was that the health needs of the individual citizen should be the prime determining factor in respect of the service to be given.  So far as finance is concerned, there are differences in the position of individual citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>Here we come to the centre of probably the stormiest of discussions in recent years on health services&mdash;the question of the means test.  I have never known, over a long period of years, a time when the labour movement, in a broad sense, has not been <Col N="1930" /> opposed to a means test.  A means test is not a method of ensuring that a person with an adequate income will pay for whatever services he requires but is rather a means of ensuring that the poorest sections of the community will only receive that service after they have been humiliated and driven to the point of desperation.  I am not particularly concerned then with providing necessary services, whether they be social services or health services, for that section of our community which can possibly provide them for themselves. There are other ways of reducing the size of the hole in the net and of catching those people.  We have done it in respect of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>We have applied a means test in many ways in our legislation&mdash;in our method of raising finances for the State.  We do it in the case of income tax and rates and in various other forms.  But if there is to be a proportionate contribution to the community services, based on the income of the various sections in that community and of the various individuals in it, the test should not be applied at the door of the doctor's dispensary or of the clinic or in the room at the side of the sick bed.  We should find some other way of making that test so that when the individual is seeking medical service, whether it be in a hospital or other institution, he should be free of any other worry or commitment except that of securing for himself and those dependent on him the immediate service that is required to protect and restore his health.</P>
    <P>Having made these fairly broad and general comments, I want to say frankly on the Bill itself that I do not think the Minister should take very much congratulation on it.  I was somewhat surprised at Deputy O'Higgins's vehemence in his criticism of the Bill. He said, in effect, at one stage that the Bill is not going to provide anything new, while at the same time he seemed to feel that the Bill is so&mdash;not revolutionary, it is certainly not that&mdash; obnoxious in many ways and is open to so many objections, that it should be delayed and subjected to new criticism.  In so far as the Bill is concerned, <Col N="1931" /> the Labour Party, quite frankly, are not supporting it because of its merits.  They can find very little merit in it, but they are supporting it because of the principles in it which are at stake in so far as health legislation is concerned and because of whatever small advances are being made under it.  The advances may be small from the point of view of providing more extended and more adequate health services, for the community, but even so these small advances have to be welcomed and supported by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We cannot, on the basis of our outlook and policy, accept the viewpoint that has been adumbrated very widely through the country that the Bill is to be condemned purely on the question of the cost involved.  If that were to be the approach, then probably most of the social legislation that has been introduced in this and other countries over the last half century would never have reached the Statute Book, because, in every case, those proposals when brought forward were condemned mainly on two grounds: (1) the cost involved, and (2) the impossibility of the community carrying the additional burden.  But the community has carried the burden, and the health and welfare of the community have been improved because the community had the courage to ignore that type of criticism and to insist that, so far as social life is concerned, progress and upward advances were desired instead of standstill fears as to what to-morrow would bring.</P>
    <P>I have read through the Bill fairly carefully.  Quite frankly, I am at a loss, in many instances, to understand what the Bill really intends to convey. I think that in so far as the Bill itself is concerned, that the lower income group, or to use the more correct term &mdash;the public assistance group&mdash;are getting little or nothing beyond what they enjoy at present.  It is correct to say that there has been a slight change as regards the determination of means. How far that change will continue, it is hard to know at the moment.  There is the suggestion in the Bill that, at the beginning, the people in this group <Col N="1932" /> will make a declaration as to their means.  They are then required to report any changes in their means.  If they fail to do so, they will be guilty of an offence.  If they give false information they will be dealt with under a penal clause in the Bill and can be fined up to £50 as well as being sentenced to three months' imprisonment, or be made suffer both penalties.</P>
    <P>When one recalls the agitation that was carried on against the system of differential rents in Dublin and other centres because of the same type of requirement; when one realises that the declarations in regard to income and changes in income related not only to the head of the house but to his sons and daughters&mdash;that he had to take responsibility for the statements in respect to their income&mdash;one can see that, after a while, even though this white card is supposed to wipe out all the obnoxious memories associated with the red ticket, the old application of the means test will start to operate again.  While there were many strong objections to that system of eliciting information about income in respect to differential rents, it can be said that, in the case of the son and daughter of a family who were asked to state their income, and the contribution they were making towards the rent that at least they were going to live in the house in respect of which their income was to be a determining factor.</P>
    <P>We have here an interesting development that now the son and the daughter are to be regarded as contributing to the income of the individual who is seeking some of these health services.  We know that very strong objection was taken to that principle when it was applied in the case of differential rents in Dublin and in other places.</P>
    <P>In the case of other groups dealt with in the Bill the position is so unclear&mdash;due largely to the question as to what regulations may be made&mdash; that it is very difficult at the moment to measure in any degree what, in fact, are the benefits which are likely to flow to any particular one of the groups in the Bill.  In the case of an insured worker the Minister has <Col N="1933" /> already pointed out that, whereas a man to-day can receive free hospital treatment, this Bill proposes to impose on him a fee of £2 2s., and that he can also secure the same treatment for his dependents by the payment of a fee up to the same maximum.</P>
    <P>In the case of other groups left outside the three first sub-sections of Section 14 there is no indication as to what the charges are because they are to be prescribed by regulations and are apparently to be at the mercy of the Minister and of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister used one phrase which attracted my attention.  He said that in formulating his criticism of the insurance scheme proposed by the medical association one aspect which induced him to consider his own scheme rather than that of the medical association was the fact that the scheme under the present Bill would continue to develop a health service under the democratic control of our democratic system.  I would like to be clear on that because it seems to me that there is one thing which is made most clear in the present Bill.  It is not merely the question referred to by Deputy O'Higgins that the Minister, under Section 63, is divesting himself of all responsibility but that he is clamping down, in a tighter form than ever before, the complete control of the county manager over the services set out in the Bill.  Frankly, I do not see where the democratic control of the elected local authorities comes in so far as the Bill is concerned.  That is one aspect that is highly objectionable.</P>
    <P>There is in Section 4 another peculiar feature.  I take it that it is an attempt to amend one of the features to which objection was made in the 1947 Act.  It is set down that no citizen will be required to undergo examination or accept treatment in so far as the Bill is concerned.  At the time the 1947 Act was going through, I personally expressed the view that, in the same way as we took power to prevent a parent physically abusing his child by beating him, we were entitled to ensure that the child was not abused by being denied proper medical care and attention.  We had <Col N="1934" /> a very extended debate on these aspects of the matter at the time and, possibly, the feeling to-day is that we should not take quite so stringent a line in respect of the individual citizen.  I understand that if the section is left as it is in the Bill and it becomes law, we can have the interesting position that a typhoid carrier can work on food to be eaten by many hundreds of people and that, except for the proposed regulations in regard to persons handling food, there will be no power to control that person and to see that he or she does not continue to be a menace to everybody he or she may come in contact with.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, I suggest the Minister should look at the section again because it is only some years ago that we had a situation like that in Dublin and there were no powers at the time to deal with it and very peculiar measures had to be taken to try to prevent that carrier becoming a wider menace.</P>
    <P>A peculiar aspect of the Bill&mdash;one that will be referred to by individual Deputies&mdash;is that the test of the Bill cannot be made in many ways on a national basis because the existing medical services largely depend on the way in which they are applied and administered in county to county. Speaking from my experience in Dublin, I can see certain limited benefits being provided by the Bill.  I agree that, while the insured worker at the moment receives hospital treatment without payment and will now, possibly, have to pay up to two guineas, he has the advantage of a similar service being made available for his wife and children.  That is a certain advantage and the man has to weigh the gains against the losses.</P>
    <P>I agree that, particularly in the case of the higher-paid workers, particularly those in clerical employment, small business people, and so on, who will come within the limit of £600, the Bill will provide many advantages.</P>
    <P>There is one criticism that should be made here against the Bill.  The Minister, in explanation of his reasons for not including general practitioner service, seems to feel that the heaviest <Col N="1935" /> burden that falls upon families in the middle income group is hospital expenses. I do not altogether agree with that.  The heaviest expense in many cases is the ordinary expense of going to the family doctor, paying 7/6 or 10/- and then buying the medicine.  In many cases the calling in of a doctor is deferred and deferred for hours and days in the hope of being able to avoid the expense until finally the sick person become so ill that only hospital treatment will meet the case.  Then the hospital expenses start to mount.</P>
    <P>In many ways the cost to the nation of ill health, especially among the middle income group, would be very considerably reduced if these people could be relieved of the continuous fear that some member of the family may become ill, that the doctor will have to be sent for and medicine bought.</P>
    <P>Even though there is the provision that certain services can be made available where hardship can be shown, my feeling is that in many cases these persons will be slow to take advantage of these facilities.  Even in regard to the maternity services which are to be provided for certain groups on payment of this £1, I feel that in practice it will not be availed of because there are many people&mdash;and I think they are foolish&mdash;who will not claim, and in many cases have not claimed, under national health, never mind what they regard as part of the public assistance system of health services. I can well imagine a person like a bank clerk in a small town being very slow and reluctant to pay his £1 in order that his wife may qualify for this maternity service.</P>
    <P>We should again examine the basis on which that charge is being made. The Minister seeks to argue that it is a form of contribution.  We know very well it is not.  Reference has been made elsewhere to the proposal made by the Trades Union Congress, that a nominal charge would be made to get around the difficulty.  There was no lack of clarity as to what the purpose of the charge was.  We were anxious to get the health service.  Objections were being raised and we suggested <Col N="1936" /> that a means could be found whereby a particular service could be brought in, apparently on an insurance basis, and if that was not satisfactory let those who were opposed to it make the objection.</P>
    <P>I feel that the present approach is on the same basis but, instead of that, it is being based on the payment of £1. It is being given, supposedly, a contributory basis but, of course, the scheme as a whole is not in any way tied to the insurance principle, and in practice it will be found far better to wipe out that particular charge and, in so far as we feel that the welfare of mothers and children should be the first and primary consideration we should avoid difficulties and complications and make the service available on need and not on the payment of any fee.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned as I said with the principle of providing extended and improved health services we can find no objection.  From that point of view, naturally, we feel that the Bill should be supported.  At the same time we want to make it quite clear that we have the strongest possible criticism to make of features of the Bill.  We hope that on Committee Stage it will be possible to bring forward that criticism, possibly not in the form of amendments because of the type of Bill, because of Standing Orders, but the Minister has indicated his willingness to consider criticism, and we would propose to test his good faith in that regard, because in many cases the amendments can only be put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If he desires, as he indicated in his introductory speech, the best possible health services that can be provided out of our resources at present, then I think he should listen to the suggestions made in the House and not, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins pointed out, steam-roll the Bill through by the strength of the votes behind them. We had that experience before when discussing a health Bill.  After very strong criticism we were told by a representative of Fianna Fáil that in the final analysis votes would decide it.  If that should happen again it would be a bad approach.  It would <Col N="1937" /> mean that an attempt to deal with the health services would again be made the cockpit of political differences. Whether we can avoid that I do not know.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned we have approached this matter on the basis of our desires in respect to the health services.  We have very great differences with the Minister on many features of the Bill, but we welcome even the slightest advance, and indeed the advance is very small at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that not very much was raised by way of principle on this Bill, and I do not think that I am called upon to deal with any details which were raised.  These can better be dealt with in the Committee Stage. There were a few matters of general principle raised which I propose to refer to.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins stated that my figures with regard to maternity beds were not the same as were given on another occasion.  All I can say is that the correct figures were given to-night.  In the figures given to-night, no account was taken of the beds at present provided for unmarried mothers.  They are left aside on the assumption, I suppose, that they will be needed for that purpose in the future as in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another point mentioned by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins which I should like to deal with.  He said that the dispensary doctor would lose his private practice.  I cannot see how that will be.  The dispensary doctor or, in fact, the private practitioner will be exactly in the same position when the Bill is passed as he is at present.  The dispensary doctor is a general practitioner dealing with medical assistance patients.  The general practitioner who is not a dispensary doctor deals with people who pay a fee.  They will remain in the same position in the future as they are in at the moment.  The only difference is that the dispensary doctor will no longer have to attend to his dispensary patients in cases of mid-wifery&mdash;at least, he will not have to attend them free&mdash;because a woman in the lower income group will be free to choose whatever doctor she wishes.  She may choose a dispensary doctor or any other doctor.  If she does choose the <Col N="1938" /> dispensary doctor, he will be paid a fee for attending to her.  As far as the dispensary doctor's general practice is concerned, he will be in the same position, because there is no reason why he will not get the same type of practice he has at present.  But, in addition to that, he will, I am sure, get some of his dispensary patients as maternity patients and be paid for them, so that he will be better off.</P>
    <P>Take the general practitioner who is not a dispensary doctor.  He should at least be better off because presumably he will get some of these dispensary patients also and will be paid for attending them.  I cannot see how any point can be made that any general practitioner, whether he is a dispensary doctor or not, will be worse off in his general practice when this Bill is passed than he has been in the past.  It is not right that that point should be made.</P>
    <P>One other matter was mentioned by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins to which I should like to refer.  I do not want to be put in the position of finding fault with medical men.  I quite agree with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy Larkin that the medical men in this country have given very good service. But referring to medical men is a very different matter from referring to the medical association.  For instance, I have often found great fault with the Labour Party, but I have never found any fault with labouring men.  The labouring men, I think, are foolish who vote for the Labour Party, but the fact that I find fault with the Labour Party does not mean that I am saying anything against labouring men.  Anyway, 90 per cent. of them do not vote for the Labour Party.  The fact that I say anything about the medical association does not mean that I have anything against the doctors.  I think that the doctors on the whole have done very well.  Just as I find fault with the labouring men who vote for the Labour Party, I find fault with the doctors for electing the executive they have in the medical association, because I think they could put in a more sensible executive if they had more sense.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Larkin's <Col N="1939" /> speech very carefully and I can hardly find any fault in what he said.  I think Deputy Larkin outlined what might be called an ideal scheme of health services for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He dumbfounded them on the other side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised however, at the speech because, if he was speaking for the Labour Party, I am surprised at the attitude he took up in this House some two years ago.  I presume he was speaking for the Labour Party.  As I say he outlined what might be regarded as an ideal health scheme.  But we must, of course, have regard to what we can afford.  It may be that Deputy Larkin is right, that we should give free medicine and free medical services to everybody and try to take the money off the people in another way.  It might be better, but it is not easy to see how that can be done as we are in the position that the rates are practically as high as they can go and the taxes are practically as high as they can go.  We have, therefore, to look at the position and try not to increase the rates or the taxes more than is absolutely necessary and that means not to extend our services to any wider classes than we think needs them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I want to make clear because it was referred to by Deputy Larkin, not in an offensive way. When we speak of doing away with the red ticket, I made it clear in my introductory speech that we are only doing it as a matter of convenience.  I do not mind if a person says to me: &ldquo;You are taking away the red ticket and giving a white ticket.&rdquo;  That is what we are doing.  We are taking away the red ticket and giving a white card.  This is what we are aiming at. Under the present law a man must go <Col N="1940" /> to a warden for a red ticket every time he needs a doctor.  If his wife gets sick in the middle of the night he has to go to a warden for a red ticket and then get the doctor.  It might happen that he would have to go again the next night to the warden and get a red ticket and then go for the doctor. He might get sick himself on the third night and some one would have to go to the warden for a red ticket and then go for the doctor.  That is what we want to cut out.</P>
    <P>The idea is that if a man says he is entitled to free medical services and is in the lower income group and is found to be so by the local authority, they will issue a white card which will last for 12 months.  There is no such thing as going to the warden for a ticket.  I am not making any claim that that is less degrading than the red ticket, but I am saying that it is more convenient for the person concerned.  There is no use in talking about things being degrading, and so long as we have the means test all these things must apply. Deputy Larkin spoke about a number of things.  Really, so long as we have a means test these things must all apply.  If we can do away with that means test they will not apply.  As it happens, our Bill has this means test and the other things follow automatically. On the Committee Stage we can, as Deputy Larkin said, discuss these matters.  Perhaps we will be able to improve things to a certain extent. I am quite open to suggestions for improvements in the Bill.  If suggestions are made about amending the Bill, I promise to give very careful and sympathetic consideration to them.</P>

      <P>While it is not possible and it would not be in order to discuss the proposal for legislation <Col N="1948" /> dealt with by the House some minutes ago, it will be possible to discuss the peregrinations of the Minister for Health in the last 12 or 18 months.  He took up office in 1951, flying a kite for Deputy Dr. Browne and he has been flying that kite from Cork to Donegal, from North to South, and from East to West, for the last 18 months.  What a kite it has been! The hand that held the kite was the hand of the Minister for Health but the cord was weighed down and tied around Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne.  This kite was supposed to be a wonderful new health scheme and I think it is proper that, in reviewing the administration of the Minister for the last 18 months, we should discuss the vast amount of tilting that has gone on at multifarious windmills since he resumed office.  We were first told when the present Minister found himself restored to office that we were shortly going to have a mother and child health scheme which would be free for all.  That was assured to the people of the country by those who put the present Minister in power. It was assured to them by Deputy Cowan, by Deputy Dr. Browne, by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and by every one of the multi-coloured Deputies who support the present Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what the people of this country think of the administration of this Department in the last 18 months.  Was the Minister paid his salary to create false hopes in the breasts of Deputies Cowan and Browne?  Was he paid his salary to bedevil relations between the State and the medical profession?  Was he paid his salary to turn the members of every county council in the country against a health scheme?  Was it for that purpose that he was put there as Minister for Health?  I do not know at the end of the story.  The Minister would like to see this the end of the story but he will find that it is only the start of the story itself.  Despite all the play-acting and antics that he <Col N="1950" /> and his Government have indulged in during the last 12 months, sooner or later the people will realise that this important matter of health is not the plaything or the particular monopoly of any particular Party or Deputy in this House.</P>

I have no idea how much it is going to cost but the cost is going to fall on your rates, and the cost on the rates will be something around 2/- or 3/-.&rdquo;  Why did the Minister do that unless he intended the scheme he was going to introduce to be killed and be still-born?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can wait for as long as necessary, to ensure a proper receptive demeanour on the faces of the Minister and others.  I want to make this charge in all seriousness. The Minister for Health wanted to placate certain Deputies, Deputies Browne and ffrench-O'Carroll.  At the same time, he did not want to cut athwart the low rate campaign being indulged in by Deputy Cogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that the Minister finds himself doing the things I now refer to and for that reason he talked about a free-for-all health scheme.  For that reason, he ensured that every local authority in the country would be against it and for that reason he stated to-day that the scheme he was introducing would not be his responsibility but the responsibility of the county councils. He then had achieved a wonderful political miracle.  He had got Deputy Browne, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll to dance the same step like the Royalettes.  That is the political miracle the Minister thinks he has achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that all the great promises made 18 months ago are so many broken words.  Everything that was so important when the last election was being fought, when the Government was in the meltingpot, is forgotten, and the Minister has brought in to-day a proposal which recognises existing services and saddles those who thought they were to get a free-for-all health scheme with five different kinds of means tests.</P>

      <P>For these reasons I hold that the record of the Minister, for whom personally we all have a high regard, is amongst the worst ministerial records the House has ever had to investigate.  I regret to say of any Minister that he has done nothing, but I am afraid it is true to say it of the present Minister.  During the past 18 months people have been sick and have been dying just as they were in June, 1951, and there are still only the same number of maternity beds and the same hospital facilities.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister why, instead of all the talk and all the nonsense he has indulged in in the past 12 months, he did not devote his time and the time of his Department to devising some practical solution of the health problems of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by pressing on with the hospitalisation drive, by giving better dispensary conditions in rural Ireland and by providing some of the machinery under which the health scheme can operate?  Why did he not devote attention to that?  If he had done so or had even done something, he would have achieved a very important advance in the past 12 months.  In that connection, he can report nothing, and it is astonishing that, in introducing the Estimate, he was so ashamed of his own lack of progress in these months that he had not a single word to say as to why this money should be voted by Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <P>The Deputy accuses me of not being serious about this Health Bill.  I am serious.  I brought it to Second Reading and the reason I got it to Second Reading is that my colleagues are also serious about it. Every colleague in the Government is serious about this Bill and that is why it has reached the Second Stage.  My predecessor was serious about his Health Bill, but his colleagues were not, and he never got so far.  That is the difference between the two.</P>

      <P>It is said that I tried to hold Deputy Cowan and Deputy <Col N="1958" /> Browne &mdash; naturally I am delighted to hold them, if I can &mdash; because I adopted Deputy Browne's scheme.  I said here in introducing my Bill that I was taking exactly the White Paper issued by me in 1947 and following it exactly, having made some changes after meeting the county councils and so on. Deputy O'Higgins has the art of not sticking to the truth.  I never said 2/- or 3/- on the local authorities &mdash; I said 2/-.  The Deputy is able to build up a case by saying 2/- or 3/- when it should be 2/- or 1/6.  I said to the local authorities that my estimate was 2/-, but they asked me, every single one of them, to reconsider the matter from the point of view of whether a charge could not be made for hospital attendances.</P>
      <P>I agreed because I am a good democrat and Deputy O'Higgins finds fault with me because I agreed.  He says I got them to object purposely so that I could do so.  I did not, but I listened to them and agreed, and because there is now a reduced sum in relation to central and local authority funds, I say that my estimate is 1/6 in the £ instead of 2/-.  That is how that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate, it was put down last July.  The Dáil adjourned for the Summer Recess without considering the Estimates for certain Departments and mine was one of them.  The Dáil very kindly gave us the money to carry on, provided we introduced a £10 token Estimate to give the Dáil an opportunity of discussing the Health Department, and that is what we are discussing to-night.  I wonder what Deputies think of the performance by members on the benches opposite.  The expenditure of the Department of Health is somewhere about £5,000,000.  It has a lot of activities, and the House has heard what Fine Gael had to say about it.  Is it not a nice example for anybody coming in to listen to this deliberative Assembly discussing these matters and to hear what the Fine Gael Party, the Opposition in this country, have to say about the Health Department in respect of a full 12 months?  Any outsider who came in here and listened to the discussion would go away with a very poor <Col N="1959" /> opinion of this Dáil, but I suppose we have to put up with the material we have.  We cannot get any better on that side.</P>
