      <P>When I reported progress last night, I had been pointing out that the question before the House was directed to two members, Deputies Dr. Browne and Cowan.  I also pointed out that, irrespective of the by-elections and irrespective of the viewpoint conveyed in the speeches from members of the different Parties, ultimately whatever decision was taken this evening would be the vote and responsibility of these two Deputies and their colleague, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll. I went on to point out that nobody could cavil at them casting their votes any way they thought fit. That is the privilege of any member of this House no matter to what Party he belongs.  But I did question the <Col N="376" /> basis on which they proposed to cast their vote and I questioned the basis on which in advance of the conclusion of the discussion they committed themselves to support the motion of confidence in the Government.  It is as well not merely from the viewpoint of the life of the present Government but also from the point of view of trying to maintain some clarity in our political life that decisions of this character, which are so vital at the present time, would bear some relation to reality.</P>
      <P>It is most difficult particularly for those of us who in many ways in the past and even to some degree at present have found ourselves on common ground with Deputies like Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan in respect of major matters of policy and social affairs to follow the peculiar development of their minds in relation to the last two years.  I recall that Deputy Dr. Browne in particular has repeatedly expressed not merely opposition to the policies that have been pursued by the present Government but very grave concern.  He did indicate at the time of the election of the Government which he supported that he had certain expectations as to how their policy would work out.  Later he indicated that he had been gravely disappointed in so far as that policy had quite clearly brought about a position in which there had been a very considerable increase in unemployment and a very considerable increase in prices without as he had originally hoped a parallel increase in wages and salaries to compensate wage and salary earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On these basic issues it seems to be very difficult to understand and appreciate the position in this debate.  Even within the past 24 hours in so far as the policy of the Government is concerned there have been major questions of doubt raised particularly by Deputy Dr. Browne.  To-day the two Deputies to whom I refer find themselves, whether they like it or not or whether they appreciate it or not, supporting a Government which by some peculiarity now finds itself with responsibility for the situation in this country which was asked for in the report of the Central Bank and which quite clearly, as far <Col N="377" /> as I can understand, cannot be accepted or endorsed by Deputies with the outlook of Deputies Dr. Browne and Cowan.</P>
    <P>It is a most startling development to find that the policies adumbrated in that report by the Central Bank which were publicly repudiated by the Government and which the Government says they were not bound to follow have worked out in practice to such a very close degree on major economic questions and that after two years of watching the working out of that policy it is still possible for these two Deputies to justify the continuance of their support of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Apparently, their justification is to be found not in any conviction that the policy of the Government is the correct policy but rather on the attitude that they must condition their support to the present Government by their attitude to what they regard as the record of the Fine Gael Party.  One might quite well agree that the record of the Fine Gael Party over the period 1922 to 1932 was one that met with the opposition of practically all progressive elements in this country.  One might take it from what was said by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan, particularly Deputy Cowan, that the record of the Fianna Fáil Party particularly in the period 1939 to 1947 was one that was opposed by all progressives.  In that way, we have got almost an equal balance.  But that in itself is not sufficient to explain their votes, nor is it sufficient to justify the manner in which they propose to cast their votes.</P>
    <P>I posed a question last night, and I think it was a fair question.  It was this: do these two Deputies prefer to see a position in this country in which the only choice which is going to be offered to the people is that of a Government by Fianna Fáil or by Fine Gael because that, in effect, is the position that they are helping to create.  They propose to continue their support of Fianna Fáil and they propose to disassociate themselves from any alternative which is practicable and which can exercise any restraining influence or act as a brake, on the <Col N="378" /> more conservative elements in Fianna Fáil and, on the other hand, can exercise pressure on the more progressive elements in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, like every other Party in this country, is not homogeneous. It has its progressives and its conservatives, and to the extent that Fianna Fáil constitutes the Government, it is, I think, the duty of those of us who have a progressive outlook to try and do what we can to strengthen the progressive elements in that Party and ensure that they will follow more progressive lines.  I do not know of any way in which that can be done by placing ourselves in thraldom to Fianna Fáil.  Those Independent Deputies who have now gone through two years of that political thraldom not merely have not taken a different viewpoint from the Government on any major measures, but seem to find it impossible to dissociate themselves from even the most minor matters of policy.  Deputy Cowan, particularly, is not merely an apologist for Fianna Fáil, but one must feel that his most nauseating qualities are somewhat sickening to the members of Fianna Fáil themselves.  That, I think, is not a position that is easy to understand. The frequent little sparring matches that we used to have between the Minister for Finance and Deputy Cowan have now passed away, and the two are like cooing doves, the Minister for Finance patting Deputy Cowan on the head.</P>
    <P>As regards the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to the Labour Party, one would gather from it and from the <i>Irish Press</i> that their hearts are bleeding for the Labour Party.  We are told that the Labour Party are going to lose seats to Fine Gael, that the Labour Party is imperilled and with the <i>Sunday Press</i> calling Deputy Larkin to save the Labour Party from Deputy Norton.  I wonder do they think that we are all children and that the Labour Party is run on the same basis as their Party &mdash; that, when the Leader comes into the room, all bow down.  Deputy Norton is the elected Leader of the Labour Party, and to him we give our loyal support as the elected Leader, no more and no less.  We have, within the Labour Party, that conception and <Col N="379" /> understanding of Party loyalty which may appear somewhat peculiar to them. That kind of play-acting, while it might apparently bring results in regard to Deputy Cowan, is certainly going to have no effect in so far as the Labour Party is concerned, and Fianna Fáil knows that very well.  But they are very clever politicians, and they realise that, with the help of their daily newspaper, it is very easy to cause confusion and create misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>We have the latest example of that in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> with a seven-column heading: &ldquo;Aiken's reply to Costello&rdquo;.  In smaller type we have a heading with what purports to be a quotation from the speech that I made last night.  &ldquo;We expect little from the Coalition: Larkin.&rdquo;  The statement I made was that when we entered the inter-Party Government we expected little from the inter-Party Government and I gave my reasons.  It was an experiment.  We were entering a field of activity where we had not got men who had experience of administration or the exercise of executive authority in Government Departments.  The inter-Party were taking on responsibility for the first time and naturally we realised the difficulties and disadvantages of that.  I made what I considered to be a reasonable, fairminded explanation as to why we did not expect undue results at that time.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is concerned at the moment not with what happened in 1948, but it is very much concerned with what is going to happen this afternoon, and as to what is the future that is facing them.  They are very anxious to kill and destroy the idea in the minds of people in this country that there is any alternative to Fianna Fáil.  To the extent that they can create, as they think, friction between the Labour Party and other Parties in opposition, and to the extent that they can create, by that type of deliberate distortion, misunderstanding, they hope to build up a wall of security around themselves, an atmosphere in which there will be complete division between all the Parties in opposition so that Fianna Fáil will be saved by that division.  The Labour Party did <Col N="380" /> participate in the inter-Party Government and to that extent they are still prepared to provide this country with an alternative to Fianna Fáil, subject to that alternative being in conformity with the central points in the Labour Party programme.</P>
    <P>I think that in many ways we should give credit to Fianna Fáil for this, as I pointed out last night, that over a long period of years, even though there might be disagreement between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil and even though for many years Fianna Fáil, as the Government of this country, did things that we thought were not proper and failed to do things that we thought were essential, yet the differences between us were not so sharp and a crisis did not arise; but with the continuance of the development of the more conservative aspects of Fianna Fáil policy and the growing reluctance on their part to give any heed to the viewpoint of the masses of the people and their growing disassociation with the actual lives of the people, breaking point finally came.  The breaking point came in 1948 when we adopted our policy to meet what we thought was a critical situation.  It was agreed upon at meetings of the Labour Party that on that point there was a growing demand and growing pressure from elements who have supported the Labour Party over many years.  It was based simply upon the proposition that: &ldquo;If we, the electorate, vote for Labour because we are opposed to Fianna Fáil how long are the votes we give to the Labour Party in the Dáil going to be used to permit Fianna Fáil to put through policies that we as ordinary electors are opposed to&rdquo; and we finally had to make up our minds.</P>
    <P>That applies to Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan because nobody in their sane senses will suggest that the election of Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne was on the basis of the policy that has operated for the last two years.  I do not think, in the wildest imagination, that Deputy Cowan or Deputy Dr. Browne received the votes given to them on the basis that their votes to-day in this House would be to justify a policy that has increased unemployment by nearly <Col N="381" /> 27,000 in two years.  They were not given votes to support a policy that has increased the cost of living from 103 to 126 points in two years.  They were not given votes to allow that increase to take place while at the same time the wages and salaries were adjusted by a maximum of ten points.  Deputy Dr. Browne was not even given votes to support the type of Health Bill that has been going through the House.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is quite proper when facing the realities of this vote of confidence to try to examine the basis on which these Deputies propose to cast their votes.  I put the question to the members of Fianna Fáil as I put it to those Independent Deputies.  Are we to pursue a policy in which, as I say, the alternative to a Fianna Fáil Government is a Government composed solely of Fine Gael?  I wonder do ordinary back benchers of Fianna Fáil ever ponder that question.  The Tánaiste said last night that, in his opinion, we had now reached a stage of development in this country, because of proportional representation, in which Governments would have very narrow majorities.  If Fianna Fáil cannot be the Government, whom do they want in their place?  It is a fair question, and it is a fair question to Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan.</P>
    <P>The country to-day cannot afford any longer government solely by Fianna Fáil or solely by Fine Gael.  We have the record of Cumann na nGaedheal in ten years and we have had the record of Fianna Fáil.  I think the majority of the people now feel that even though the progressive elements that are outside of those two Parties may be divided and splintered in this House much to our general misfortune, it is desirable that until such time as the present political situation has worked itself out there should be some kind of a break from either of the big Parties. That is the way the elections are going to work out for some time.  There will be some period before any one Party in this country will have a clear and unequivocal overall majority.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, then not merely the Labour Party but members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Independents <Col N="382" /> must make up their minds what combinations will develop.  If Fianna Fáil objects, as they have been so strenuously telling us, to any association of the Labour Party and Fine Gael to-day, will they tell us what the alternative is?  Are we merely to give, as Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne have given, unquestioning and servile support to Fianna Fáil no matter what they do as a Government? When we come back here after a general election and Fianna Fáil is a minority, votes given to the Labour Party are to be cast to return Fianna Fáil as a minority Government; and having done that they are to sit with their fingers in their mouths for five years or less while the machinery of Fianna Fáil continues to churn out their particular policy whether we like it or not and whether the Fianna Fáil back benchers like it or not.  I see Deputy McGrath smiling.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy say what Social Welfare Bill the Cumann na nGaedheal Government passed from 1922 to 1932? Could he indicate one measure of social amelioration that they brought in?  Did they not reduce the old age pensions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1947 the Fianna Fáil Government refused a miserable half-crown to old age pensioners on the grounds that the Government could not afford £500,000.  Now when they have learned a lesson they can afford another £11,000,000.  Incidentally on the subject of social welfare no matter how anxious the Labour Party may be to provide for it, there is something <Col N="383" /> more basic.  There is no use setting out to provide social welfare as a sop for 27,000 additional unemployed men and women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cover the ground again that I did last night in great detail.  I want to mention one particular point.  Deputy Dr. Browne has raised the question of the alternative. Deputy Dr. Browne has the same responsibility of any other member of this House for finding the alternative himself.  If he fails to find it let him carry the responsibility outside.  He has asked whether the Labour Party has its programme ready.  I have already pointed out that the Labour Party does not propose to take a number of points from its general election programme and offer them to Deputy Dr. Browne, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or anybody else.  We propose to contest an election on a Labour Party programme. We have to say quite clearly what we regard as essential.  If nobody else feels they are essential, we are satisfied to stay where we are.  We have no ministerial ambitions and from the point of view of the elections and the preparation of the Labour Party programme it is not a question of ambition. The Labour Party happens to have a democratic organisation and the question of that programme is now going through the process of that organisation.</P>
      <P>In due time our programme will be presented not merely to the Party as a whole and to the public but also to Deputy Dr. Browne.  Deputy Dr. Browne can quite easily set down the principal points of any programme on which the Labour Party could associate with other Parties and he will generally find that he and I would agree on the points which should be basic to any Government policy and they are the points he is not getting from Fianna Fáil.  He realises that it is becoming vital to decide who is going to settle the financial and credit resources of this country.  There is no difference between us on that.  It has been indicated even by the Tánaiste that that is a problem that is presenting itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cowan and I will agree that the present unemployment position is of such a character that it should be treated as an emergency.  I wait with interest to see whether the Taoiseach, when replying, will give the undertaking to Deputy Cowan which that Deputy asked for.  Deputy Cowan asked for an assurance that the present unemployment problem will be treated as an emergency.  I can see the Labour Party giving that undertaking but I wonder will he get it from the Taoiseach and, when he is not given it, will he still vote for the Government? Every vote that is cast by these three Independents may be divided into the 27,000 unemployed and each of those votes is equal to 9,000 idle men and women.</P>
    <P>Equally with those Deputies the Labour Party can agree on housing. It is significant that in the period of two years in which this Government has been kept in office by the votes of these Deputies employment on local authority housing, which is the most vital factor and the most vital sector of housing, has dropped from 11,000 to 7,000 men.  These Deputies in the Labour Party would not agree with that.  They give credit generously to the fact that it was a Labour Minister, the late Deputy Murphy, who not merely initiated the present housing campaign but put such tremendous impetus into it that it is still rolling along after two years of Fianna Fáil attempt not merely to delay it and hold it up by their financial policy but by a continuous tightening up of red-tape regulations.  So much so that in Dublin even the local members of Fianna Fáil on the council have to intervene with their own Minister to get him to relax the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>However, let us conclude on the point.  As I said earlier, I do not expect that Deputy Cowan, <Col N="386" /> Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll will change their decision on this vote.  These things do not happen like that but I do think it is important that they should realise what their vote signifies.  In my opinion, while Deputy Dr. Browne has maintained a very strong personal support over the past two years, I understand that, in respect of wide sections of the people, week after week that support is departed from, not because of his attitude on questions of health but because health is not the whole sum and that one cannot cover by a progressive policy on health the support of a conservative policy on the basis of economic issues which determine the health of the people.  That is the dilemma that Deputy Dr. Browne has got himself into and in which only he can make a decision. He is quite at liberty, if he is satisfied that his present policy is the correct one, to sacrifice his political support and his political future.  I do not for a moment think he has got any personal ambition or is concerned in any way with being in public life from the point of view of any prestige.  I think, even possibly, to some extent, it applies to Deputy Cowan although he has a little more ambition than Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
      <P>Neither of these Deputies nor Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll is entitled to sacrifice, in addition to their personal political prestige, the support and the sincerity that was given to them by their supporters and I frankly think it is a fair and straightforward question to put to these Deputies, whether they believe the men and women outside this House who voted for them in 1951 are convinced that they have been pursuing the proper policy during the past two years and are convinced that the votes of these three Deputies will be passed correctly in accordance with their mandate when they give this vote of confidence to the Government.  I frankly do not think so.  But, whatever may be my opinion or the opinion of Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Cowan, there is one other factor that we are all agreed on, that is, that we are the servants of the people outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the reluctance <Col N="387" /> of these Deputies to vote against the Government is based on one very simple fact&mdash;it is the same basis as conditions the attitude of the Government &mdash; that at the present moment a general election will result in reduced support for the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is more than likely that their Government will not continue.  It may be quite true, as the Tánaiste says, that as a Party it is quite proper for them to utilise every device of the parliamentary machine and of the Constitution to remain in office as long as they can in the hope that their policy, from their point of view, will show results that will swing opinion back.  But, in the meantime, outside this House, there is a majority of people who do not want to wait, who want to have their ordinary democratic right now, to pass judgment on this Government.</P>
    <P>The Government, as I say, is quite entitled to go on for the full five years, if they can, but I question whether Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll have an equal right to go against the clear expression of popular opinion in the by-elections and, quite clearly, against what must be the basic outlook of their own supporters and to allow this present situation to continue in which every vote cast by these three Independents represents 20,000 idle men and women and a balance of 9,000 idle men and women, when they cast their votes to keep this Government in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively to speakers on both sides of the House.  I listened with very close attention to the speech made by Deputy Larkin last night and this morning, in which he gave the reasons for the political policy which Labour have pursued since 1948.  His speech to my mind was a revealing and frank picture of the political situation as he saw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned that it was the desire of each political Party in this House to achieve office without the support or assistance of any other political group.  That is quite a reasonable statement.  For many years past Fianna Fáil have adopted that <Col N="388" /> attitude.  They were not prepared to take part in a Government unless they themselves had complete say.  They were prepared to accept support from people on the side line but there was no part in that Government for people who were not members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Fine Gael view, it is quite reasonable for me to suggest that if they had the strength of Fianna Fáil they, too, would like to have a Government composed completely of Fine Gael Ministers but circumstances are such that at the moment and for many years to come I do not believe that the Fine Gael Party, even though they have shown a revival, will be in any position to assume office on their own. Consequently we have statements by the leaders of the Fine Gael Party that they welcome co-operation from other political groups in this House.  In that respect they show more agility and a more intelligent approach than the Fianna Fáil Party have shown.  The Labour Party, according to Deputy Larkin, would like to have enough Deputies in this House to give them a majority.  As far as the Clann na Poblachta Party is concerned I was a member of that Party for a number of years and it was our desire always to have enough Deputies in this House to form a Government, but I gather from the statement made by the Leader of that Party recently that they no longer believe in a Government by Clann na Poblachta and that they have now changed to a policy that would give us a Government on the same lines as that in Switzerland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was never the intention when that political Party was formed.  I have nothing more to say on it except that I agree with Deputy Larkin in this, that in 1947 and 1948 when Clann na Poblachta began the policy we had in the Clann was the Labour policy and we made no bones about it that we were in thorough agreement with the Labour Party on all major issues.  We believed that we would succeed in winning the support of the people of the country where <Col N="389" /> Labour, to my mind, had failed up to that, but there was no fundamental difference between us with regard to policy.</P>
      <P>I came into public life as a member of Clann na Poblachta, as a firm believer in that policy which I have since pursued as an Independent.  It was no desire of mine to be here in this House as an Independent.  It was as the result of disagreement on a fundamental issue that I left the Clann na Poblachta Party in 1951, and from 1948 until the present time I have never made any secret of the fact that I had as little time for Fine Gael as for Fianna Fáil.  If I had in 1947 and 1948 a belief that either of these Parties would solve the difficulties that faced this country and put into operation a suitable economic policy, then people like myself would not be in public life in Clann na Poblachta&mdash; we would be members either of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  Consequently I find myself in a completely independent position in this House, with no allegiance to any political Party but with an allegiance to the policy which I pursued since I came into public life. I still say that, as far as I am concerned, as a young man I see no difference on fundamental matters between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I know indeed that Fianna Fáil will disagree with me and feel very annoyed that such a suggestion is made.  They can point, and rightly so, to many achievements in the field of social welfare and in certain advances made in the industrial life of the country.  They can point to those achievements, and they deserve credit for them, but in fundamental matters I think there is no real difference.  We have even to-day Deputy MacEntee across this House shouting that Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal as they were, reduced the old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are making a vital mistake if they are harping on their achievements of the past with little to offer the youth in the future.  That is the tragedy of this position that they have taken up to-day.  It does not make the slightest difference to a young man or woman in Ireland, be it in Dublin or in rural areas, to-day what Cumann na nGaedheal did <Col N="390" /> between 1922 and 1932.  There is not one single extra vote going to go to Fianna Fáil for suggesting that Cumann na nGaedheal reduced the old age pensions in 1931.  What the public want to see is what is going to happen from 1953 on, not what was the attitude of Fine Gael between 1948 and 1951.</P>
    <P>Now, as I see it, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are fundamentally conservative in the major field, in one of the most important aspects of public life, that is the question of control of our own credit and financial system.  I see no difference between the outlook of Fine Gael and that of Fianna Fáil in that matter.</P>
    <P>Coming to the field of agriculture, I do not propose to go into it to any extent except to say this: Deputy Dillon is very fond of saying here in this House: &ldquo;Let the facts speak for themselves.&rdquo;  What progress has been made in the last 30 years under Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil in the field of agriculture?  It has to be admitted to-day that little or no progress has been made in that most important aspect of our life.  They both have their differences of opinion on a system but neither of them has so far made a success in the field of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the methods adopted by these major Parties for solving the unemployment problem. That problem has been there since 1922 and little or no improvement has taken place.  Emigration goes on merrily all the time.  Without going into detail too much I would like to suggest that the main plank of agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the one thing in which one can see co-operation between both, is in their belief in private enterprise as a solution of our difficulties.  Both of them have stated time and again that they believe that private enterprise, admittedly with a certain amount of State help, is going to be the solution to the problems in the West of Ireland and the problems of development generally. That is common ground.  Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael believe in that.  Consequently there is to my mind a great difference between Fianna <Col N="391" /> Fáil and Fine Gael on the one hand and the Labour Party on the other.</P>
    <P>Down the years Fianna Fáil have succeeded by good tactical manoeuvres in making Fine Gael to my mind really more conservative than they are.  I am being perfectly frank in all this because I believe we must face facts.  I would like to say that I believe this country has now reached a new stage in political development and that the causes of what we are discussing to-day in this House started away back in 1947 or 1948.  Deputies will recollect that in 1947 there were three by-elections and that a new Party on the political scene, Clann na Poblachta, swept the decks in two of those by-elections. It must be remembered that they were new, they had no organisation worthwhile, but in spite of that they won two seats from Fianna Fáil, against the Government.  That showed that in 1947 people were getting very dissatisfied with this big Fianna Fáil machine.  In other words in 1947 and 1948 Fianna Fáil was slipping back.  I do not propose to deal in any detail with what happened between 1948 and 1951 except to say that Clann na Poblachta played an important part in public life in those days, even earlier, from 1947, because they gave a feeling to the people that there was hope for the future, that there was a chance that other people could guide the destinies of this country apart from Fianna Fáil and the present Taoiseach. The Clann failed, and failed badly. We will leave it at that, but if they did nothing else they put new life into Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I remember that in Galway in 1948 Deputy MacEoin was speaking in the square and said that Clann na Poblachta was only a chip off Fianna Fáil and that the chip would return to the block in a very short time.  Even there the belief was prevalent amongst Fine Gael that Clann na Poblachta represented the more progressive view of the Fianna Fáil Party and that much of the support coming to Clann na Poblachta was coming from former Fianna Fáil supporters who had become dissatisfied with the Fianna Fáil outlook and programme between 1938 and 1947.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> In 1951 the people were bewildered and the general election showed that they had not made up their mind what they really wanted.  Fianna Fáil got a chance.  They had regained a certain amount of support from Clann na Poblachta but the remainder of the people decided to stay aloof and wait patiently until they would see what was going to happen.  In the period 1947-48, Fianna Fáil got a bad fright and they got three years in dry dock to make changes.  They came back here in 1951 a little chastened but with no new blood&mdash;or there may have been new blood but no young blood on the Front Bench.  They spent the next three years carrying on as if there had been no break between 1948 and 1951; they carried on in the same way as they did between 1938 and 1947.</P>
    <P>We are coming to a transition period in Irish politics.  To my mind, the old generation represented both in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is losing its grip. A new approach on economic matters is needed here in this House.  As I have already said, Fine Gael have shown more ability to adapt themselves to changing circumstances and changing times.  I do not know what is going to happen here on this motion, but judging by the result of the by-elections, if there were a general election in the near future, Fianna Fáil is facing a period in the political wilderness. That may happen this evening or it may not happen for 12 months or two years; but I believe you cannot stop the avalanche, that the tide has turned and that Fianna Fáil is going to lose.  Whether they can postpone their defeat this evening is another matter.  They will have to face the wilderness, be it in 12 months' time or two years' time, and no action that they take in the meantime can stop the avalanche overwhelming them.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest admiration for Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.  He is an individual, as Deputy Larkin said last night, who has his own place in Irish history.  It might be no harm for Fianna Fáil now to put the ship into dry dock.  There is a lot of timber on that boat that needs replacement. There is a new set of officers needed&mdash; and I think that a new captain on the <Col N="393" /> bridge at this stage would be no harm. There should be more promotion from the ranks and a new crew taken in and a chance given to them.  A period in the dry dock for Fianna Fáil would do them good.  They would have a chance to study and see where mistakes were made and to put a more progressive policy before the people in future.  That means, of course, that while they are there a new ship will be launched to guide the destinies of the State &mdash; and I, personally do not envy the captain with the crew.  No doubt there will be many on that boat very fine members, good officers, but he will have some brigands as well.  There is no doubt that on any boat like this you are bound to have a few who are out for plunder.  You will have that on the next ship that sails &mdash; but that is inevitable in Irish public life.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has suggested that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned they represent the Irish people.  The inter-Party Government, as it was in the past, was a matter of different sections of the community pulling together.  Fine Gael represented one section; Labour, Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan represented other sections.  Surely if Fianna Fáil represents the people, as Deputy de Valera suggested, it must represent, in order to get the support it has here, the big farmer, the small farmer, the poor man, the rich man, the industrialist and the labour groups; and are not all those groups inside Fianna Fáil fighting their corner?  Is not the same thing happening in an inter-Party Government, with only this difference, that in the inter-Party Government&mdash; I am not going to stick to the last inter-Party Government, but any type of inter-Party Government&mdash;they can fight their corner in a Cabinet or common room and in the interests of all concerned hammer out a policy?</P>

      <P>I think it is a very constructive suggestion.  I agree thoroughly with the Taoiseach.  I do not think it is a good thing as a rule to buy a pig in a bag.  I think it would be a good thing if the various Parties going to form an inter-Party Government or multi-Party Government would sit down and agree to hammer out a policy, so that the Independents and everyone else would know what they were facing.  I have no objection to that and that is what I would like. I am trying to point out that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned they are really a group of Parties that are held together by the personality of the Taoiseach himself.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, it should be quite clear to anyone who wishes to check on my attitude in this House what I propose to do in connection with this vote.  This motion says: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;reaffirms&rdquo; is very significant as far as I am concerned.  The day this present Government took office I saw no reason why I should have confidence in Fianna Fáil going back into power and I am afraid my judgment was right at the time.  I say I am afraid, because the results have been sad in the last two years for many of our people.  To my mind, this vote of confidence would mean that if I wanted to support the present Government on certain issues I would have to take responsibility, a certain amount of responsibility, for the budgetary policies that have been pursued in the last two years.  I could not accept any responsibility whatever.  I never agreed from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; with the method adopted by Fianna Fáil in their efforts to clear up the alleged mess.  If that mess did exist, they should have found another way out of the dilemma because further hardships were imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> I think the Taoiseach was very foolish in putting down this motion.  It is quite clear that there have been issues in this House on which I gave support to the present Government, and I made clear in my remarks here on the day that the Taoiseach was elected that, even though I was not supporting him as Taoiseach, if good legislation was introduced I would have no hesitation at any time in giving my support to that legislation, and I have done so.  At no time have I tried to take advantage of the Government's weakness with regard to numbers in this House for the sake of putting them out and I have no intention at any time of lending myself to any such proposal or action.  But this is a different matter.</P>
    <P>Last night the Tánaiste said that good times were coming.  I have not been many years in this House but the longer I am here the more cynical I am becoming with regard to the good times promised.  The Tánaiste said that the worst part of the blizzard was over and that good times were coming. He made the reasonable case from the political point of view that Fianna Fáil having weathered the storm were entitled to the political benefits of the victory which will come in the next two years, that they are entitled to get from the people an appreciation of Fianna Fáil's efforts.  That is asking a little too much.  I do not believe that in the next two or three years there is going to be a Utopia in this country. If the main reason why this motion was put down, as the Tánaiste said, is that Fianna Fáil want a chance in the next two years to reap the political benefits of their budgetary policy of the past two years, then I do not see how I can support them.</P>
    <P>May I say that as an individual I dislike intensely the idea of having to face the electorate in a strenuous campaign? I know perfectly well that every Independent Deputy will have to face the power of the political Parties in an election.  I have very many political scars left on me after the last election.  I can say quite definitely that I owe no thanks to any political Party for assisting or helping me in the <Col N="396" /> last general election.  As a matter of fact, I was more slandered by political groups on the Opposition side than by Fianna Fáil.  Having looked at the matter calmly and conscientiously and taken into consideration the results of the by-elections, I feel that the most reasonable course for the present Government to pursue would be to ask for this vote of confidence in the polling booths and not in this House.</P>
    <P>I say that in the knowledge that if there is a general election there will be a strengthening of Fine Gael.  I believe that is bound to come, but we can do nothing about it.  Even if the election is postponed for 12 months, it will be all the same.  But I think a strong Labour Party, perhaps with Independents in this House, will ensure that we will not have an overall majority again in this House for any Party that will trample on the lives of the people, especially the poorer sections.  I think there will be sufficient Deputies to ensure that that state will not be reached.  In addition to that, I do not think we should treat the Irish people as fools.  Having had experience of this type of majority dictatorship for 17 or 20 years, I would say that they will be very slow to hand the reins of office to another Party, who differ very little from that particular organisation, to allow them to pursue a similar course of action for four or five years.  We need not worry about that.  I do not know what will happen as far as this vote of confidence is concerned, and if the Government do stay on, I want to reiterate what I said on a former occasion, that if there is good legislation introduced in this House, no matter who likes or dislikes it, I will support it at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy McQuillan, I realise that it is a matter of considerable difficulty for those Independent Deputies who have been watching the progress of the country in the last few years to separate the two aspects of Fianna Fáil policies, that aspect which is concerned with putting the finances of the nation into order and that which relates to our permanent policy for the national <Col N="397" /> development of the country.  But at this stage it is essential for us on this side of the House to reiterate the statement that everything we have done in the past and everything that is going on at present indicates that we are in no way reactionary, that we have formulated most of the advanced policies, indeed virtually all of them, which have brought progress to the country in the belief that the people can stimulate economic activity through their own Government.</P>
      <P>That idea was initiated by us and it still is our conception.  The idea that the State can stimulate private enterprise, can assist private enterprise, can replace private enterprise where it is absent, is being pursued at a far higher level of activity than it was during the period of the inter-Party Government.  So far as giving private permanent employment is concerned, employment that lasts, employment that is not based on false economic ideas, employment that is not purely temporary, we still have in our Party credit for most of the ideas, for most of the policies, and we can point to most of the results.</P>
      <P>I hotly resent the suggestion either by members of the Labour Party or any Independent Deputy that we lack initiative, that we are reactionary, that in any sense we are a Party who are not prepared even to take risks when we think risks are worth taking in helping to stimulate industry in this country.  We have at this moment a long term programme for agricultural and industrial development.  We believe quite sincerely that if the people of the country can watch the progress of that programme and co-operate in making it a success we shall prove that we have, as we have had in the past, the know-how in regard to the regeneration of this country, in regard to overcoming all the evil results of our history.  It is for that reason that we have asked for this vote of confidence in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has cost this country tens of millions of pounds in the past 20 years to half convert the Fine Gael Party to some of our ideas.  Their blocking tactics in the past have made our problem in the future more difficult. <Col N="398" /> They have delayed progress, have delayed in giving the people of this country confidence in their own institutions and in their ability to progress. The Fine Gael Party has been spoonfed with Fianna Fáil doctrines.  The only normal thing in their policy is the result of their attempting, urged by Labour, to look through Fianna Fáil spectacles and these spectacles have never fitted and we do not believe they ever will fit.</P>
    <P>I believe myself that a great number of their own supporters in the country have no genuine belief in some of the Fianna Fáil policies which they have half-adopted, and have been compelled to half-adopt through pressure that has been placed upon them by the Labour Party.  You might say that pressed by the Labour Party, their policy has been a stilted imitation of some aspects of Fianna Fáil policy, served up with a rather doubtful sauce in order to make it more attractive.  We have had evidence recently that they were prepared, if they think it pays them, to become more conservative again, and some of the observations they made on social welfare and health, and their failure to pass the Social Welfare Act in their term of office, were evidence of the fact that I do not believe they have a real genuine philosophy of their own.  During their term of office they neglected many aspects of Fianna Fáil policy which was left to them in the form of plans in operation or about to come into operation and showed once again their conservative instincts. There was an obvious case for the expansion of the sugar-beet industry, but it was not expanded.  There was an obvious case for the expansion of the machine-won turf industry, but no action was taken for two years.  In regard to a number of major industrial developments they delayed taking any decision.  In regard to the tourist industry, they failed to amend legislation governing the administration of the Tourist Board.  That was left to us.  They did not inaugurate any new policy of note.  I think the only single new policy they had was that in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  They boasted a lot about the land rehabilitation scheme, but what they were doing was changing the <Col N="399" /> emphasis in regard to certain details of administration in respect of the land reclamation scheme and they gave it a new name &mdash; the land rehabilitation scheme.</P>
    <P>They talked a lot about capital development, as though they had invented the idea, but the idea of encouraging private and public capital investment was the exclusive invention of Fianna Fáil, done in spite of opposition by Fine Gael.  And after all the talk and boasted achievements, in this year we are spending far more money on our own Fianna Fáil capital development schemes than they spent, and we are doing it in a sound way.  We are raising money in a sound manner.</P>
    <P>During the course of the by-elections that have taken place, I tried to find any reference to how the Fine Gael Party would face the problems of the day, and during this debate I have listened to nothing but abuse with no positive suggestions.  There have been vague suggestions that if they were returned to office they would prune public expenditure.  They are well aware that we have got to make savings of some considerable amount in order to balance this year's Budget. They are well aware that we have had to desist from the habit of overspending during the financial year in order to balance the present Budget. But beyond trifling suggestions for economies we have had no definite proposal as to how they would prune expenditure or suggestions by means of which they would reduce taxation. We have had all sorts of vague suggestions about restoring subsidies but they have not given any evidence of showing where they are going to find the money to restore subsidies&mdash; whether they wish to leave the Budget unbalanced deliberately &mdash; or whatever action they propose they have not indicated it to this country.</P>
    <P>They have talked vaguely about making use of external assets but they have given no details either to the country or to the House as to how they would make use of these assets. We have challenged them and said that there was not very much over <Col N="400" /> £120,000,000 reserves left and asked them what they would do; what way they would diminish that reserve or at what point they would stop, or for what purpose they would reduce the reserves. We have had no positive statement from them whatever.  We have made it clear that we are perfectly willing to make use of investments in England for productive purposes and that when the net reserve is reduced to an amount that bears some reference to one year's imports that care must be exercised.  We have no conservative view about the repatriation of assets. We have had a lot of vague talk by members of Fine Gael without any indication of how they would use the assets if given an opportunity.  Many vague references were made to the high rates of bank interest by some members of the Fine Gael Party but none of them committed himself to any action in that regard, and in fact, most of the suggestions they made in regard to economic policy were suggestions concerning matters about which if they were really sincere they would have commenced detailed investigation during their last term of office.  Anything that looks advanced in Fine Gael policy in connection with economics must obviously be studied carefully and if they had any sincerity they would have set about the investigation of such fundamental problems as rates of interest and control of finances and so forth.  It is very easy to talk vaguely about these matters but the proof of their sincerity would have been the investigation of these matters either by themselves or any kind of commission or committee they cared to set up. They set up no commission or committee and so far as external assets were concerned the strangest irony of the whole situation is the fact that they actually invested huge amounts of securities in Great Britain and it was only after they had left office that they were liquidated.</P>

      <P>We claim on this side of the House that the Opposition have grossly exaggerated the difficult conditions of to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are well aware that times are difficult for housewives in this country and in all countries in Europe, in countries that never saw the war, in countries that remained neutral during the war and in countries that gained in prosperity as a result of the war.  The difficulty of the cost of living is to be found everywhere, but we think that it is completely wrong and recklessly dishonest to exaggerate these things. We do not admit that misery and starvation are stalking the land.  We have only to go around the country and to travel abroad to other countries to realise that we managed to survive a difficult period in our economic history reasonably well and that, provided there is some stability of Government and a lively vigorous Government with a forward constructive policy, economic conditions should improve.  I <Col N="402" /> think the lie No. 1 in regard to the whole of the latter during the election took shape in the deliberate attempt to persuade the people of this country that the increase in the cost of living was caused solely by this Government, that there was something unique about it, and that there were no other countries in the world in which the cost of living had risen to the same extent as it had here.  Deputies opposite, during the election, poured forth their tearful sympathy with the people so cruelly treated, and they made bloodcurdling attacks on the Government which they alleged were solely responsible for the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is much easier to rant and exaggerate about that matter than it is to tell the dull facts, because facts to refute that sort of talk are dull and unimpressive to the people of a country who have to buy their requirements and who, like the people of every other country, find the cost extremely high.  The propaganda indulged in suggests that we can remain isolated from the rest of the world and that no matter what happens outside the country, costs here can somehow be kept down.  At one time subsequent to 1950 and the outbreak of the Korean war, if Deputies study in detail the commodities indices, they will find that a great many raw materials increased temporarily by 100 to 120 per cent. above the pre-June, 1950, cost.  All these materials introduced into the manufacture of goods here had a tremendous effect on the cost of living.  Members of the Opposition like to give the impression to the people that the price of agricultural produce can rise in this country by 40 per cent. since 1947 and that that will have no effect on food costs in general, whereas it must alter the scale of living costs inevitably.</P>
    <P>It is just as well to give some facts in regard to the position in relation to the cost of living in this country compared with others.  I got from the United Nations statistics, a statement of the principal countries in Western Europe and how the cost of living stood in 1950 as compared with 1938.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can have the figures.  He does not like to hear of what happened during the three years of the Coalition, during which they had an opportunity of proving all the assertions they made of gross profiteering and during which they had an opportunity of correcting the price control administration, examining it and making it better if they could.  In 1950 in comparison with 1938, Ireland was about halfway down the list, so to speak, of ten principal European countries in the order of cost increases. There was a number of these countries in which the cost of living had gone up less than here, partly because of subsidies and partly because of the strength of their currencies, and there was a number in which the cost of living had gone up more than in this country, partly because of war destruction, partly through an evident lack of good price administration and partly because of inevitable losses associated with severe destruction.  In any event Ireland was just about halfway down the list.</P>
      <P>If the position is again examined in 1953, after the Korean war and after all the difficulties of rising costs, it will be found that this country is still about in the same position &mdash; about halfway down the list, with countries above it and countries below it.  I shall not go into the figures in detail but they reveal that there has been nothing abnormal here in regard to that situation.  The cost of living has gone up in two relatively undamaged countries in Europe and in a neutral country in Europe as much as it has here.  Of course, it is very easy to try to persuade the people of the country that we are responsible for all of it but it is far more difficult to refute that statement because people are naturally human.  They like to blame someone for the ills and the difficulties that beset them but, as I have said, if any Deputy cares to study in detail the United Nations figures for the increase in the cost of living he will see that the position is as I have described it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming the Coalition Government for the fact that Ireland was just halfway down the list as I have said.  That is not my point.  I <Col N="404" /> have indicated the reasons for other countries being in a better position in regard to the cost of living &mdash; such as subsidies for which taxation has to be raised, and in these countries taxation would be higher than here &mdash; and the reasons on the other side of the fence so to speak.  The point is that after the difficult position created by the Korean war there is no evidence, as far as I can see, that the cost of living became uncontrolled.  In other countries which had to face similar difficulties to those which we had to face, control was maintained but certain countries, either because they were damaged during the war or partly for reasons of bad administration were not able to maintain effective control and the increase in the cost of living was greater in these countries than in this country.  Some countries through the strength of their currencies continued to be slightly better than we were in regard to the cost of living, but in general, the position of this country was maintained.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate in this House one would get the impression that there had been no increase in wages since 1950.  I think it is essential to stress again that, while the position is not as satisfactory as we should like it to be, the increase in wages that has taken place since 1950 has gone at least some distance to compensate for the increase in costs.  I wish to stress again that we wish that to be so.  We made it perfectly clear that under present circumstances the best thing for this country was to have a realistic approach to the cost of living and that the only way of doing that was to reduce the subsidies and to compensate for that by increased children's allowances and by making it evident that wages must increase. Listening to some Deputies you would imagine that there had been a complete standstill in wages since 1950, that no compensation had ever been given either in the form of children's allowances or increased benefits to the workers of this country, and that they were not in the same position in that regard as they were before costs increased. I think it well to stress that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the <Col N="405" /> Taoiseach gave some account of the difficulties through which we have been passing.  I think it is well to stress again that nothing exceptional that has happened in this country has not happened everywhere else.  Previously, I recorded, for the future history of the Dáil, many quotations from the reports of international economic organisations which foretold very accurately exactly what would happen once the boom, stimulated by the Korean war, commenced.  As I have said, the results have been similar in practically every other country.  The only difference between this country and some other countries is the fact that the last Government, who pretend to be modern economists and who pretend, I presume, to understand modern economic theories with regard to the extent to which the State can influence economic development &mdash; which, I suppose, has best been propounded by the late Lord Keynes &mdash; thought they knew all about them but certainly they applied them in a completely crazy manner.</P>
    <P>Economists, either those representing the socialist school or those of the more conservative type, do not differ very much any longer.  They have more or less the same ideas.  But the last Government, by failing to balance the Budget of 1951, broke every known modern economic principle.  There was nothing modern in that whatever. There was nothing up to date about it.  It was simply the result of careless government.  It had no economic foundation.  It was a policy that would not be recommended either by the socialist economic advisers in Great Britain or by what might be called the advanced semi-socialist administrative liberal Administration of Sweden.  It was solely a political device to escape disaster and it made the difficulties for us, who succeeded that Government, all the greater.  We had to clear up the mess and apply what we believed to be up-to-date economic principles.  The result was unpleasant for everybody.  Those results are now passing away.  Even their prophecies proved wrong.  They said that the present Budget would show a surplus of £10,000,000.  In that <Col N="406" /> connection, it is interesting to remind the members of the Labour Party that the economic adviser of their own T.U.C., at the time of the Budget, said that in his view the picture was false.  He condemned the Budget, but he made it quite clear that he did not believe there would be a surplus&mdash;and he proved right in the event.  There was no surplus.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that members of the Labour Party should have any great satisfaction in the acts of Fine Gael. My own belief is that their support of Fine Gael is not justified in their own interests.  If they really consider long-term policy and long-term progress, and forget the difficulties of the past two years, I do not believe they should have any great faith in the Fine Gael Party in the future.  Members of the Labour Party disliked the corrective effects of our economic policy and were disappointed that the cost of living continued to rise for a time.  They were disappointed at our having to reduce the subsidies.  At least, I should like to draw to their attention the fact that we put through this House a Social Security Act, the fact that business is slowly but steadily improving, the fact that unemployment is steadily decreasing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>More schools are in course of erection than at any time during the term of office of the Coalition Government.  We are spending about five times as much on land reclamation as was spent in the last full year of the Coalition Government. We are employing more people on arterial drainage than were employed by the Coalition Government in their last full year of office.  We are planting far more acres of forest than were planted by the Coalition Government in their last two years of office.  We are providing more money for roads. We have multiplied the machine-won production of turf by three, compared with what was done in the last full year of the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of consumers in the rural network of electricity has been increased by 30 per cent.  We are providing 11 new power stations for using native fuels.  During the whole term of Office of the Coalition Government, no power station was sanctioned which was to burn native fuel of any kind.  We have schemes for harbour development.  No work was done in that regard by the Coalition Government: <Col N="408" /> it is now being done by the Fianna Fáil Government and it is giving employment.  We have arranged for the ordering of new ships by Irish Shipping Limited.  Nothing was done in that respect by the Coalition Government. Measures to expand tourism are now in operation and the number of new industries that are starting is constantly increasing.  Therefore, so far as one of the major features of what is known as modern economic policy to overcome trade recession is concerned, not only are we doing more work but we are employing more people and spending more money than was ever spent by the Coalition Government.  It is a major feature of what is known as modern economic policy.  I do not believe myself that there are any panaceas in this world for some of the ills of mankind.  Even when the Government spend large sums in regard to capital development, there may be certain adverse repercussions.  Believing that the national development of this country has long been delayed through historical influences, all we can say is that we are employing this policy in full measure and are devoting a sum of nearly £40,000,000 this year to capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>I took occasion to examine some of the economies in other European countries where there are, shall we say, advanced administrations or administrations that are not reactionary, where the interests of the workers are safeguarded and where the State assists private enterprise.  I found that the money that will be spent in this country this year, as a percentage of the income of this country, is as high as in any other country in Europe. We have nothing to be ashamed of. There is no sign of any conservatism on our part.  If you compare the capital expenditure, exclusive of any defence construction, in this country this year with that of any of the modern countries in Western Europe, the comparison is excellent, so far as we are concerned.  There is no evidence of any kind of reactionary feature in the economic measures taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>So far as the unemployment that now exists is concerned, the House has <Col N="409" /> heard from both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce the measures taken to speed up works, the plans for which have been under consideration, in the Dublin area and other areas.  I wish to stress again that we are fully aware of the present difficulties being experienced in the constructional trades and it is interesting to note that the previous Government never even thought of what was going to happen if local authority works ceased in certain places because the schemes were completed.  No preparations were made by them to provide for that situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as usual, misunderstood me.  I was speaking of areas in which local authority works have been more or less completed.  If in a certain county, due to the good work of the county council, the vast majority of houses required have been built, there is immediately a problem of how to employ people in the building trade in the area.  They have been trained for a particular class of work and they cannot be asked to go to knit socks in another place.  It is a real problem, a problem the present Government have to face.  Our attitude is, first, that we have far higher expenditure on capital works of every kind which create a good effect in every area and, secondly, we are hastening the examination of schemes where this unemployment is particularly severe, schemes which still exist and are still required.  Everything is being done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was interrupted by the Deputy, I wanted to say that we would much prefer to have these people given jobs of a more or less permanent character.  We want to stimulate permanent employment, employment that can be assured for a number of years. We know more about how to give employment to people than any other Party, because it was we who initiated nearly all the schemes for giving employment and for solving this problem. We know the problem is not easy to solve, but we are tackling it as <Col N="410" /> rapidly as we can.  I want to make it quite clear that if the unemployment problem in Dublin and certain other areas cannot be solved by our bringing to fruition a regular series of schemes that are likely to continue for a number of years, quite definitely other measures of a more emergency character will have to be adopted; but it is very much better to have a series of schemes going into operation, giving sound employment over a number of years than to provide schemes of a purely emergency type.  We are considering employment both from the point of view of the permanent series of schemes and the provision of emergency employment.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely clear that, in the world in which we live, no Government could tolerate persistent unemployment in a trade where employment could be given by asking all the people to contribute their means to ensure that schemes will be provided.  We in Fianna Fáil certainly hold to that point of view.  There are some forms of unemployment that are very difficult to deal with &mdash; employment in skilled industries where workers have been trained in only one kind of work and where there may be a temporary recession, due either to excessive imports, as took place during the period of office of the Coalition Government, or some other cause such as a sudden ceasing or reduction of public demand. For example, recently there was some recession in the motor car assembly industry, but now one has only to look at the registration number plates in Dublin to realise that the demand is coming back again for private cars. The industry, I think, has gone through its period of recession and conditions in it are better.</P>
    <P>In regard, however, to what might be described as the constructional trades, I hold the view that the Government has an obligation to do all it can and we are examining the position. My own belief is that we shall be able to tackle the problem satisfactorily. There is a certain hard core of unemployment about which I need not go into detail because it has already been mentioned by other speakers but which no Government, <Col N="411" /> neither this nor the previous Government, has yet solved.  Average unemployment during the years of the Coalition Government remained at a comparatively high figure compared with some other countries.  They were not able to solve the problem.  They had a level of some 7, 8 or 10 per cent. of unemployed as compared with the whole working population, whereas certain other countries, I think, largely because of defence commitments, were able to reduce that percentage.</P>
    <P>The last Government were not able to solve the problem, and during their period of office about 100,000 people left the country in addition.  To my mind, it is extremely dishonest for any person to say here that he can solve the problem of the hard core of unemployment, unless he gives very specifically an indication of how he proposes to do it.  Most people who talk about the hard core of unemployment never give details and never explain how they are going to overcome some of the adverse reactions that might arise if they attempted to solve it.  I have been speaking about the particular problem which we have faced recently, and my own belief is that Fianna Fáil has all the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and all the ability to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to our action in connection with the Central Bank Report.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me again to state very definitely that we did not follow the proposals the Central Bank Report made to us.  We took some of the statements made as a warning, but in regard to their principal proposals, we have done exactly the opposite.  We believed that their advice should be examined and that their evidence in regard to statistical economic facts should be examined. Many of the facts they put forward were correct.  We thought their proposals were much too drastic, but I want to say again that I as an individual and collectively as a member of the Government will not be associated with the slavish acceptance of the Central Bank Report put forward by <Col N="412" /> Deputies of the Labour Party.  I deny it.</P>
    <P>The principal proposals were that we should cut down public works&mdash; we did not cut down expenditure on public works; as I have already indicated a record amount of money is being spent this year under the heading of public and capital works.  The second proposal was that certain capital types of work should be paid out of current income and not by borrowing. We did not do that; we are borrowing money for all our capital works.  The other main proposal made was that we should have a large Budget surplus to correct inflation. There never has been a Budget surplus; there was a slight Budget deficit last year, and this year, only by making economies on current expenditure and not on capital expenditure, will we succeed in balancing the Budget.</P>
    <P>In regard to the principal heads of the Central Bank Report, we did not follow their suggestions, and the whole idea that this Government is a Government desiring to suppress the people, to restrict development, to prevent development and to cut down on expenditure for increasing production is a myth created by people whose only interest is to attack us without reference to the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin, speaking again about the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party, got confused, I think, as to the difference between correcting an economic situation and going ahead with a policy of full national development.  I still think that a great many Independent Deputies seem to be confused in that regard.  We have stated that so long as there is international peace, and so long as people outside this country do not create more trouble the prospects for this year are good.  All the evidence is there.  Exports have been increasing.  We believe tillage will increase this year.  Farmers have been adopting more scientific methods of development on a scale never before seen in this country.  Industrial production is increasing in many fields. The trade agreement should be to our advantage.  There is every sign of a reasonably prosperous future provided <Col N="413" /> there can be some continuity, provided we do not have the spectacle of a Government of conflicting views, a Government from which inevitably there springs dissension.  It is because we have not had the opportunity of seeing the full results of our policy that we have asked for this vote of confidance from the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I need say at this stage but, in conclusion, I want to emphasise again that the biggest difficulty we have had to face in the last two years is persuading the people who are obsessed quite naturally with their own domestic problems that most of the difficulties that have been experienced here have been experienced in other countries, countries which have known no war, which remained neutral all through the last war and which were undamaged. Yet, the cost of living in these countries rose as high as it did here and housewives in those countries experienced difficulties comparable to those experienced here.  One of the most human factors in that situation is that if one goes abroad and meets a family and sits down with that family and starts talking about their problems the first thing one will be told, whether it is a rich or a poor country, whether it is a country that faced war or remained at peace, is that the principal difficulty is the increase in the cost of living.  To try to persuade the people here that they are in a special position, that none of that need have happened is to my mind disgracefully dishonest. It has proved very troublesome from our point of view because it is so much easier to believe a thing like that than to accept the rather dull and uninteresting comparisons with other countries. I believe that by increasing production it should be possible to increase the income of the people.</P>
    <P>We, in Fianna Fáil, believe that if production and output increases the workers should share with the employers in that enhanced prosperity through increased wages, wages which will have a real purchasing value.  That is what we hope.  We believe that if the farmers can take advantage of the Government's present policy in the assurance that for a number of years <Col N="414" /> that policy will not change, they will be assisted in their development.  Increased output in agriculture will in turn make the towns prosperous and that, in turn, should bring about an increase in the real value of wages, which is a thing that has been extraordinarily difficult to achieve in any country faced with the difficulties we have had to face in the last few years.</P>

      <P>The difficulty with the Minister, and it is quite obvious from the speech we had from him to-day and from the speeches he has delivered from time to time here in this House and in the country, is that all his knowledge and experience of the matters about which he talks, the hardships on the poor, unemployment and so on is gained entirely from books of statistics and not from practical knowledge or practical experience.</P>
      <P>I presume Deputy Dr. Browne was disgracefully dishonest yesterday when he asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Was the Government going to take steps to provide sufficient capital to make employment available on the scale required?  The Opposition had not exaggerated the position with regard to the cost of living, unemployment and emigration.  These were charges that must be met by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I hope the Taoiseach will meet those charges when he comes to make his two hours' speech this afternoon. Deputy Dr. Browne went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people were well able to stand a hair-shirt policy.  They were no weaker than the people of any other nation but what hurt them was that the hair-shirt seemed to be put on for lack of thought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What hurt them was not the hair-shirt but the fact that it was put on by the present Government for lack of thought!

      <P>Those of us who had the privilege of listening to the Taoiseach in this House for the last 26 or 27 years will say, I believe honestly, that it was the poorest effort he ever made in his life &mdash;so poor that, as I say, it depressed some of his own supporters so much they had to clear out of the House.</P>

The Fianna Fáil Party are in the dock.  They are on trial and have been put on trial by the people of this country.  It is not what Fine Gael did between 1922 and 1932 that is the issue here to-day. Perhaps, I know more than anybody else in this House about what happened between 1922 and 1932.  I was here.

      <P>We are told about the progress made by Fianna Fáil.  We are told that Fianna Fáil did this, that and the other thing.  Will Deputies get it into their heads that Fianna Fáil has been the Government of this country for 18 years out of the last 21 years?  Surely to goodness, unless they were completely dead from their toes to the crown of their heads, they should have achieved something in 18 years?  Are we to assume from what they say that if there had been a Government there other than Fianna Fáil nothing would have been done in that 17 or 18 years?  Are we to assume that if there was a Labour Government, a farmers' Government, a Fine Gael Government or a Government composed <Col N="418" /> of any Party they would have sat down in their seats and done nothing for 17 or 18 years?</P>
      <P>That sort of nonsense coming from Fianna Fáil does not go down at the cross-roads now, nor will it go down anywhere else.  When I hear of the progress made by the Fianna Fáil Party in the 17 or 18 years out of the 21 years, I apply two tests.  We hear a lot of blather from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs about the schemes and plans they have for unemployment. We heard about those plans in 1931 and 1932 from the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the result of their 18 years is that there has been more unemployment in this country in the last two years than there was when they first took office 21 years ago.  That cannot be challenged. That is true.  There is more unemployment since Fianna Fáil first took office 21 years ago, notwithstanding the fact that in the same period one-sixth of the entire population of this country, that is to say, 500,000 people emigrated.  These are the two tests to apply to the progressive policy of Fianna Fáil.  That cannot be challenged.</P>
      <P>I want to assert that the only period in the last 21 years in which there was a very substantial improvement in the employment situation in this country was during the three years the inter-Party Government were in office. There is no question about that.  I invite Deputies to go to the Library to look at the figures there and check them.  These figures are furnished by the various State Departments. Deputy Dr. Browne also said yesterday that it would be unwise for Deputies anxious for industrial progress to bank on Fine Gael changing its spots.  Deputy Larkin reminded Deputy Dr. Browne that he was a member of that Government for nearly three and a half years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Is it not true to say that there was more industrial progress made in that three and half years than in any similar period since the State was founded?  More people <Col N="419" /> were put into industrial employment. Official figures are there to prove that. There can be no doubt whatever about it and Deputy Dr. Browne knows that quite well.</P>

      <P>It all depends on how you look at figures.  I challenge any member of the House to deny that during that period there were more persons put into industrial employment than at any similar period since this State was founded.  There is no doubt about that.  I hear a lot of blather from Fianna Fáil Deputies and from Deputies like Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan about the workers, the poor and the trade unionists.  I hear a lot about what Fianna Fáil is supposed to have done for the workers.  Deputy Dr. Browne talks to us about Fianna Fáil being the friend of the workers.  When were they?  At what period were they?  I challenge that.  I have always done so and I do it now.  They were always the enemy of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And in so far as they could do so they did all in their power to split not merely the Labour Party but the trade union movement in this country.  That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers and the poor of this country got a better break under the inter-Party Government than in any period since this State was founded. Wages and earnings were brought into closer relationship with the cost of <Col N="420" /> living than at any time since the State was founded.  Not merely was full employment provided for those in employment, but there was overtime not merely for the head of the family but in many cases for other members of the family as well.  It is on record that during the inter-Party Government period, for the first time since the State was established, the earnings and wages of workers passed out the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs this morning talking about the cost of living and comparing it with other countries.  Apparently, the only time he lifts his eyes from the book of statistics is to place them on the ends of the earth.  The cost of living got so out of hand in 1947 that Fianna Fáil, in order to try and befool the people, changed the cost-of-living index.  The Taoiseach the other day &mdash; he is the man who always talks to us about falsehoods, about telling the truth and not having any prevarication &mdash; talked about the cost of living going up by 13 points.  He did not tell us, but he was reminded of it afterwards, that when Fianna Fáil changed the cost-of-living index in 1947, they had in mind the Supplementary Budget which they were later to introduce.  They took out of that index the articles and the commodities which they were going to increase under the Supplementary Budget.  That was a dishonest device.</P>
    <P>We took over in February, 1948, with the index at 100.  For two and a half years, notwithstanding all that happened in that period, and notwithstanding the fact that there was more than one round of increases in wages and salaries during that period, the cost of living not merely never exceeded the 100, the figure at which we took it over from Fianna Fáil, but it actually dropped on one occasion below it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>You blinkered that by the two price system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to have something to say about that later, and if I do not say it perhaps some member of the Labour Party, when speaking, will deal with it for me.  That was the cost <Col N="421" /> of living in the three years, notwithstanding the outbreak of the Korean war.  In the three years from February, 1948, to February, 1951, the cost-of-living index went up by three points, and only increased by these three points in the second six months of that last year.  That was something of an achievement.  There was some relationship between wages and prices during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not achieved in any easy manner.  It was achieved because we were ever watchful of the prices of every commodity, and particularly of essential food commodities. We were ruthless, and that is the only word to describe it, in seeing that there was going to be no over-charging by anyone for any commodity.  Deputies will remember, particularly those who were here at the time, that I was challenged over and over again by Fianna Fáil Deputies when on this side of the House because I would not allow the butchers to increase the price of fresh meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the position, and there can be no challenging of that statement.  I was pressed over and over again by people in the manufacturing industries and by people in the distributive trades to decontrol prices.  The argument was always put to me that if I decontrolled prices and allowed free competition, it would lead to a reduction in prices &mdash; that is if they were allowed just to juggle their different cuts and so on.  But I knew what would happen, and I did not do it.  I was backed to the uttermost by every one of my colleagues in the line that I took.  The result, as I say, was that for two and a half years, notwithstanding the fact that there were increases, and notwithstanding the fact <Col N="422" /> that there were increases in the price of goods coming in from outside, and that complaints were being made to me by people that they were not getting the same margins of profits, I was quite straight in telling them that, in my opinion, they were getting a fair margin of profit, but that they were not going to get away with the immense margins of profit which they got away with during the war under Fianna Fáil.  They were not going to be allowed to do what they did under Fianna Fáil when they had wages riveted to the desk with their standstill Orders.  When Deputies from any side of the House talk about Fianna Fáil as the friend of the worker and of the poor, I ask them not to forget about the standstill Orders on wages by Fianna Fáil.  May I tell the House that there was a standstill Order on wages in draft in the Department of Industry and Commerce as late as October, 1947.  That was not during the war period.</P>
      <P>We have had all this nonsense about the cost of living.  We are told now that we are no different from anybody else and that it is dishonest to talk about these things.  The Fianna Fáil Party are to-day the Government of this country, but let me remind the House of the campaign about the cost of living which Fianna Fáil conducted throughout the country in the last six months prior to the 1951 General Election, a campaign which was spearheaded by Deputy Cowan.  Deputy Cowan put down a motion condemning me and calling for my resignation at a time when I was in hospital.  Deputy Cowan was outraged then at the increase in the cost of living which had gone up two points in three years.  He was so outraged that he demanded that his motion be taken in my absence.  He said that the people were suffering so much from the high cost of living that a delay could not be contemplated by him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan was outraged to the extent that he was shedding crocodile tears over the sufferings of his constituents due to <Col N="423" /> the two-point increase in the cost of living.  The Deputy became almost purple in the face when the price of butter was increased from 2/8 to 2/10 per lb., but as Deputy Larkin pointed out this morning, when it went up from 2/10 to 4/2 per lb., he becomes the apologist for Fianna Fáil &mdash; a champion of its increases.  It makes one almost sick.</P>
      <P>Do Fianna Fáil Deputies remember the speeches which they made about the cost of living at that time, and all the tripe that was written about it in the <i>Irish Press</i> and in the <i>Sunday Press</i>&mdash;a three-point increase in three years compared with an increase of 23 points in less than two years under Fianna Fáil?</P>
      <P>We claim that we put people into employment and good employment.  We reduced the numbers that had been queueing up at the labour exchanges looking for jobs to the lowest figure ever touched since records were kept in this country.  That is true.  Will any Deputy deny that the inter-Party Government, with the support of practically every man in this House, outside the Fianna Fáil Party, brought a feeling of confidence into this country?  It gave our people a feeling of confidence in their country such as we have not had for a quarter of a century and such as we have not had for the last two years.  There was harmony in the country and people were happy.</P>
      <P>I want to put this quite seriously to farmer Deputies in this House.  Will any farmer Deputy in this House conscientiously stand up and say that the 1948 Agreement that was signed in London did not bring a period of prosperity to this country, both to agriculture and from agriculture flowing to every other section of the people and for the first time, remember, because in the inter-Party Government it was realised, and not merely realised but acted upon, that until such time that you put agriculture on its feet there was very little you could do for any other section of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We went! London <Col N="424" />&mdash;we did not send civil servants there &mdash;and we made what I believe was an excellent agreement that has worked out in the event to the great benefit of this country.  I do not think any Deputy from any side of the House, no matter which Party he belongs to, in his heart will question that. Because it did bring prosperity to the farmers of this country, the farmers were put in a position to meet the increased rates which had to be imposed to meet the new services and to give employment.  Farmers were put in a position for the first time to be able to pay comparatively decent rates of wages not merely to their own employees but to those who are employed by the county council.  That is true and it cannot be questioned.</P>
      <P>Again, will Deputies ask themselves conscientiously, has Fianna Fáil any right to claim any credit for the enormous increase last year and this year in farming exports from this country?  I do not think that farmers&mdash; and farmers know a lot more about this than I do&mdash;will suggest for a moment that calves that were born after June, 1951, became our exports in 1952.  We hear a lot of talk about increased exports.  We are all entitled to be pleased with the increased exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  I want to go to another aspect of the 1948 agreement that was not referred to. There has been a good deal of talk by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and some of his colleagues&mdash; sometimes even Deputy Childers is let loose on it; he gets his riding instructions as he got them from the Minister for External Affairs to-day&mdash;about industrial exports in this country.  It is true to say that quite a number of our industries have been able to keep in full production and some of them in nearly full production over the last two years because they were able to export a substantial percentage of their production to Great Britain.  Why were they able to do that?  Why could that not have been done before 1948&mdash; because of the famous or infamous article in the Trade Agreement of 1938 <Col N="425" /> which was the biggest obstacle on the industrial side which we had to get over in 1948, when we tried to get Article 1 of the 1938 Agreement out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But with this difference. We were unable to get it completely out of the way, but we did get the door open to the extent that has allowed us to export into Britain hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not millions of pounds, worth of industrial goods since 1948 up to the present moment.  Deputies in the trade union movement and in the Labour movement and industrialists in this country know that to be quite true.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that some of our industries in this country because of what we secured for industrial exports in 1948 are exporting as much as 40 per cent. of their entire production and I am glad to say that the quality of the goods is excellent, so excellent and the price so right that they are meeting and beating keen competition.  I know one industry which has exported not merely to Great Britain but has exported to a continental country and has put its products into that continental country over a 25 per cent. tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

      <P>That makes hay of the remainder of your argument about the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask any person in this House who has any sort of an open mind: is there any comparison to be made between the way in which this country was governed and the fruits that flowed from that Government to the community over the three and a half years when the inter-Party Government were in office and what has accrued in the last two years?  In what are you asked to reaffirm your confidence?  For what reason are you asked to reaffirm your confidence in this Government?  Do not mind the Minister for Industry and Commerce who for, I think, the seventeenth time in the last 14 months &mdash; I have been ticking him off with a pencil&mdash;has stabilised the cost of living. As a matter of fact, he made a speech in which he had the cost of living <Col N="426" /> stabilised three days before he announced an increase of ½d. a lb. in the price of domestic sugar.  Since 1927 the Minister for Industry and Commerce has always been promising us jam to-morrow.  It is always around the corner.  He has told us now that if you will only give him another chance we will have the jam, a double application, within the next two years.</P>
      <P>Do not mind that kind of nonsense. What you are dealing with here is a Government who come in here looking for confidence from the Dáil instead of looking for it from the people, where it should be sought, a Government whose policy increased by no fewer than 30,000 persons the number of unemployed in this country within a year and a half.  It is all right for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and others to look at that in a book of statistics, but I sometimes try to visualise that figure, 30,000, as the entire population of the City of Waterford or more than a third of the population of my own county.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies here, particularly those who talk from books, just think of that as a number.  Very few of them think of the misery that is nearly always behind it.  Are Deputies aware &mdash;if they are not they ought to be&mdash; that men in this city, many of whom came from rural areas, constituents of our own, and who have been in constant employment for the last four to six years, anyway, in the building trade in this country are now disemployed. While the present situation lasts, they are unlikely to be reemployed.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk from the Taoiseach from time to time about the inter-Party Government being dependent on small groups.  He made a speech during the recent by-election in which he said that a Government that was beholden to a small group was in an impossible position, it was pushed hither and thither, and that way lay disaster.  I wonder what was he thinking about, or had he completely forgotten Deputies Cowan and Browne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things I would like to deal with, but do not want to be unfair to other Deputies.  I do not <Col N="427" /> want to inflict any further suffering. I know what was inflicted on myself yesterday by the Minister for External Affairs for two hours and 20 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs this morning, on the instructions of the Minister for External Affairs, that measures are being taken by Fianna Fáil, that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in this debate told us the plans they had for dealing with unemployment. Someone may have mentioned the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; but that is all we heard.  In any case we have been hearing about the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for dealing with unemployment for 21 years at least.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers, who is in such close touch with business, economic and social life that he lectures the rest of us here, tells us that business is improving. I will offer a wager here of £1 to 1/- there is not a businessman from here to Donegal or from Donegal to Kerry that will subscribe to that and I do not care what his political views are.  Business has been getting steadily worse over the last 12 months and at the moment &mdash; and this is part of the reason for the 30,000 additional unemployed &mdash; we are in the middle of the greatest business slump that ever hit this State since it was created.  That is true and any Deputy in touch with the people in business outside, either employers or employees, knows that is true.  Deputies who are in touch even with some of the biggest business premises in this city &mdash; it is true also outside the city &mdash; know quite well that in the last year and a half some of the biggest establishments have not made anything like enough money to pay their running expenses.  We are to vote for a continuance of that and an aggravation of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> In the light of what I have said and what has been said by other speakers on this side of the House, is it any wonder that the Government are afraid of their natural lives to go before the country?  Does anyone think that if the Taoiseach was not absolutely convinced that he would suffer the greatest political defeat he ever suffered, that he would sit there in the humiliating position he has sat in for the last three days?  No Government, no Head of a Government, has ever been in the pitiable, humiliating position that the present Government and its Leader have been in for the last three days.</P>
    <P>I will say this for Deputy de Valera: I believe that if he thought he had even a sporting chance in a general election he would take that chance.  He knows he has not.  Must he not be driven to the sorest straits to which a human being can be driven, when he is trying to carry on with the support of Deputies Cowan and Browne?</P>
    <P>It would almost make you weep to sit in this House yesterday afternoon and to see the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach, pretending to laugh and smile and enjoy the buffoonery of Deputy Cowan.  I have differed from the Taoiseach politically all my lifetime, and I suppose I always will, but I never thought his respect for himself would drop so low that in order to obtain a vote from Deputy Cowan to keep him and his Government in office he was prepared to pretend that he was enjoying the bit of showmanship put up by Deputy Cowan here, while at the same time a man of the Taoiseach's make-up and temperament must have been almost sick looking at it.  I believe the Taoiseach would go to the people if he thought he had a sporting chance, but he knows he has not.  No man has gone more often to the country, no man has gone when it was not necessary more often to the country; and Deputy Dillon read out here last night statements that Deputy de Valera made in somewhat similar circumstances, except that his position was much stronger in 1947 in the by-elections. The speeches then made by Deputy de Valera were the most compelling arguments against the motion now before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The members of the Fine Gael Party have no reason in the world, in repect of their work for any section of the community, to hang their heads in shame.  We are entitled to our views and we will put our views in this House and outside it.  We have always done so, and when the people went against us we took it from them.  We sat here for 16 long years in opposition, when we had to put up with all the unbearable and ignorant arrogance that we got from the present members of the present Government, with all their cheap gibes, and some of them very unworthy ones.  We stuck it and we kept going back to the people, general election after general election, and even when we came back here after a general election with reduced numbers it did not change our principles and our attitude in one iota.</P>
    <P>There were certain definite fundamental principles that we believed the people respected and that they would ultimately give their support to them. We knew over a long number of years that, with that particular type of political magic that is peculiar to himself, the Taoiseach was able to hoodwink the people.  We knew that the people's mind was on catch-cries, empty slogans, rather than on the hard realities and the economic facts of life.  We knew that would pass and, mind you, we put in, even in opposition, even with reduced numbers, 16 years of service to the Irish people in this Irish Parliament&mdash;which I hope the Fianna Fáil Party will have the spirit to emulate when they cross over to this side of the House very soon. It is talked and sneered about in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Sunday Press</i> and at cross-roads as if there was as great a difference between those who sit on these benches and on the Labour Benches as there is between oil and water.  What is the difference?</P>

      <P>There is no need to tell Deputies in this House that they made more money on their farms under the inter-Party Government in three years than in any similar period under Fianna Fáil! Well now, I thought you should like to be reminded of the good times that they had and I like to remind them that there is a chance even yet, that even to-day those good times may return to them again.  There is one consolation to those of them who are farmers.  Deputy Aiken is, like myself, a bit of a book-farmer, but those in Fianna Fáil who are farmers have this consolation, that whatever they may lose on the roundabouts by way of their seats they fully made up on the swings from the increases, and from the still greater increases that there will be from what they are producing off their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said last night that the Taoiseach was appealing from the people to the appeal court that consists of three, or maybe four, Independent members of this House.  So long <Col N="432" /> as they are members of this House they have, of course, the right to vote as they choose, but I want respectfully to suggest that no Deputy can conscientiously vote for a continuance of a Government that has inflicted so much hardship and human misery in the last two years and been responsible for 30,000 additional unemployed, and the loaf increased from 6d. to 9d. and so on, increasing or causing hardship and misery.  From the other side of the House we are told that people like the old age pensioners have been compensated for the increase in the cost of living.  Give the old age pensioners one loaf of bread per day for seven days of the week and this comes to 3d. more than the additional allowance they got, not to talk about tea or sugar or butter or anything else.  The thing is absurd.  We have a lot of talk about Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal as they were, taking 1/-off the old age pensioners.  May I resspectfully submit to those Deputies that the removal of the food subsidies reduced the old age pensioners and the blind pensioners, not by 1/- but by nearer to 3/- per week, even allowing for the 1/6 additional which they got. There are several ways, of course, of reducing money.  It would have been a much easier thing and weighed less heavily on the old age pensioners and blind pensioners of this country if the Government, instead of taking away subsidies from their food, had reduced their pensions by 1/-.  They would not have suffered as much, but that would not have suited Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin forestalled me this morning.  I had brought in a copy of &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; and there is a ring around the heading to which he referred, but, of course, it was much more appropriate that Deputy Larkin should deal with it because he was the person concerned and in any case he could deal with it much more effectively than I could and he did so.  One of the troubles is that 95 per cent. of the people who read this read nothing else.</P>

      <P>Let any Deputy or Party compare the record of work for this country and for all sections of the people of the inter-Party Government and the Fianna Fáil Government.  I wish this could be determined on its merits, but it is not going to be determined on its merits.  The Government, if they carry this motion to-day, will carry it by the votes of three or perhaps four Independents.  Not one of the three or four Deputies will be voting because he believes in the policy of the Government, because he agrees with the policy of the Government. Two of them at least will be voting, unfortunately, because of a vicious spite and hatred against a certain member of this House, and one of them because of a particularly violent dislike to another member of this House.  Those are the facts, and all this talk by certain Independent Deputies, and all their denunciation of Fine Gael, was just a cloak for their real reasons for voting &mdash; just a cloak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reminded last night by one of the Ministers that I disliked general elections.  Of course I do.  No one here who has any experience of elections wants joyfully to dance into the middle of one; but it is not what we like or we want that counts, it is what the people are demanding, that is what counts.  There is not a single Deputy sitting in this House to-day but knows <Col N="434" /> the people want a general election.  Is there any Deputy in public life in the last 30 odd years who ever saw such real interest in what is happening here as there has been for the last two or three months?  Have Deputies ever been so frequently accosted in the streets and on the reads by people asking them: &ldquo;When are you going to have a general election?&rdquo; Have not the people in the only chance which they got shown in no unmistakeable way that they want a general election and want it for one purpose only, to get rid of the present Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach had a perfect right to put down this motion but I object completely to the way in which it has been done.  Since Tuesday afternoon until the Taoiseach will conclude and the vote will be taken, 28 hours will have been used in discussing the motion.  If the Taoiseach wanted a vote of confidence I cannot see why, seeing that the Dáil is at the very busiest time of the year, he could not have approached the Whips and arranged that a motion of confidence be put before the House without any discussion. It could be all over in a quarter of an hour on last Tuesday or at any time fixed and the 28 hours could have been used to much more effect in transacting the business we are sent here to transact.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, it could have been done in a much simplier way. Since the result of the by-elections became known, it has been quite clear that the people have turned very strongly against the present Government. The Taoiseach could take for granted, without any motion of confidence, what attitude Clann na Talmhan, Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Poblachta would take in such a vote of confidence.  A simple letter addressed to five or six Deputies would have decided the issue as the Taoiseach knows quite well, without a long waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers on the Government side have tried to fight shy of the fact that it was the result of the by-elections which caused this vote of confidence. No matter how you side-step this result, the people in Cork and Wicklow <Col N="435" /> and Dublin North West a short time ago made it quite clear that there is a big swing away from Government policy, in other words, a very determined vote of disapproval of the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>When the present Government was seeking a vote here for the Taoiseach and subsequently for the Government, Deputy de Valera put forward a 15-point programme.  I would like that the Taoiseach, when replying, or some Minister speaking after me, would point out which one of these 15 points has been fulfilled, which has been even tackled and which ones the present Government have not completely reneged on.  It was the policy of the inter-Party Government taken over without a blush.  The only thing they could say was that in seeking support of certain Deputies on the 13th June, 1951, Fianna Fáil, not having a policy of their own, could implement the policy of the inter-Party Government better than the inter-Party Government itself could.  That was how they came into office.  One of the points was that the food subsidies would be maintained, that they would not be cut. Since then the people have learned to regard that promise in the same way as they regarded the promise of Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, a few days before the last general election, when he assured his own constituents that the tax on tobacco and drink would not be reimposed if Fianna Fáil came back to power.</P>
    <P>This vote of confidence has been brought on by the result of the by-elections. The result of the by-elections has been caused by the fact that Fianna Fáil have gone away from the people.  It is not the people who went away from Fianna Fáil, they were forced away.  Fianna Fáil has gone back on every single thing they took office and got into office to do.  Of all the rosy and very catchy promises they have not fulfilled one of them. Not alone that, but some of the promises have been put completely into reverse, food subsidies being one.  After spending three and a half years while we were the Government, blaring over loudspeakers and from every place <Col N="436" /> where they could get an inch of space in their own paper, that the cost of living had gone sky high during the time of the inter-Party Government, they got into power.  They secured their votes to a large extent on that constantly repeated fallacy that the cost of living had gone up during the time of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I remember that not long since I challenged the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, here in the House as to what had gone up, with the exception of 2d. in the lb. of butter and I think 2d. in the gallon of petrol, during our time. After a lot of fumbling for papers over there he said the loaf of bread had gone up a farthing and I think he mentioned that the ordinary household spool of thread had gone up a halfpenny.  Fianna Fáil is now learning that the Irish people cannot be trampled on, that they cannot be gulled and fooled as they have been by the present Government.  They have been sitting on that side of the House since the 14th June, 1951, just two years, because they went into power on promises they had not the slightest intention of fulfilling and which they made no effort to fulfil since they went in.</P>
    <P>Every single good work we started during our time has been smashed and cut and set aside.  The policy of a certain crowd of people behind the scenes who were trying to impose their will or their views on our Government, and that we steadfastly rejected and I am proud now that we rejected them, Fianna Fáil has swallowed and put into operation.  One of the results of that has been that we are exporting £20,000,000 worth more of agricultural produce this year than ever before, £20,000,000 more than last year.  Some of that £20,000,000 has been due to an actual increase in production, due to the policy of the inter-Party Government, but the great bulk of the £20,000,000 has been achieved by a very different means, by the deliberately and carefully calculated policy of depriving our own people of the means to purchase our own food.  I would go so far as to say that £15,000,000 of the increased agricultural exports which went across the Channel this year has <Col N="437" /> been nothing more or less than the result of Fianna Fáil policy in denying employment to those seeking work, in cutting down in every possible way and in allowing the cost of living to go up to such an extent that the working man, his wife and children, had less to eat last year and in the aggregate it has amounted, in my opinion, to very near £15,000,000 worth of agricultural produce.  The Minister for Finance could very easily walk in here on Budget day and calmly announce that agricultural exports had increased by £20,000,000. The exports have increased because the present Government have denied to the people of the country the means to purchase the food they had been purchasing and to live up to the standard that we had established.  That is the reason for the complete setback which the Government met with in the three recent by-elections.</P>
    <P>During the period from 1948 to 1951 I occasionally had to go through the city in the evening, and there was scarcely any evening when there was not a meeting at some street corner addressed by some Fianna Fáil speaker.  His theme was the way the cost of living had got out of control under the inter-Party Government, and assuring them that if Fianna Fáil got back into power the cost of living would be controlled.  I listened to them on several occasions declaring that the inter-Party Government were a shocking crowd and allowed the cost of living to get out of control.  Having listened to that for three and a half years, I do not blame people if some of that sunk in.  Some of the people believed that.  The people in the City of Dublin particularly believed it.  So much so that they went a long way to putting Fianna Fáil into power and, when they did, the Taoiseach and other members of the Cabinet proceeded to trample on those who placed their confidence in them and showed them what they thought about them.</P>
    <P>Mention was made that out of the six by-elections which have occurred in the last two years the Government succeeded in winning two, North Mayo and Waterford.  It would not be out of place if I revealed once again, as I <Col N="438" /> revealed on a previous occasion, that from my own personal knowledge the people of North Mayo were fooled.  I say deliberately that the electorate of North Mayo were fooled and fooled by no less a man than a Parliamentary Secretary in the present Government.</P>

      <P>When the present Government came into power, the first thing they did was to make bloodcurdling speeches, particularly the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, which had the effect of freezing the credit of the country.  By these speeches they wanted to discredit the inter-Party Government.  They wanted to show that they were right in some way or other.  They wanted to show that there was something seriously wrong in this country.  Incidentally, what they were doing was taking advice that had been thrown at the heads of the inter-Party Government for three and a half years and rejected by them.  That advice was to restrict <Col N="440" /> credit in the way Fianna Fáil has done. We see now the disastrous consequences of it.  I must say that I did not see what would be the full consequences of it when we were receiving the advice.  I see the consequences now.  Private employers and people who might be inclined to put money into private enterprise had their credit frozen.  People had put money into the building of houses and had from 50 to 70 men working for them.  These workers are now in England because credit was frozen.  People could not get credit to continue building and, when houses were built, there was nobody to buy them.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have stated that they are bringing down the unemployment figure from the 90,000 at which it stood a short time ago.  If they are bringing it down, how are they bringing it down?  They are bringing it down by the mean device of trying to put people off the dole.  It is not the man who is drawing the dole wrongfully that is being put off.  We know that some people are drawing the dole wrongfully, but it is not that type of person that is being put off.  It is, perhaps, the father of a family who has no work or who has not a shilling who is being put off.  The Government increased the cost of living on that man, and now the few shillings he was getting are cut off and he can starve.  The resul can be seen by everybody.  Anybody who goes to a railway station can see trainloads of our youngest and bes flying from the country as if from the plague.</P>
      <P>I have not much contact with the City of Dublin, but some of the events that happened recently, particularly what happened yesterday afternoon outside this House, are enough to disquiet anyone.  I can understand Deputies representing city constituencies being quite alarmed.  I have been ten years coming to this House now and never before have I seen between 2,000 and 3,000 people in a crowd marching outside the House, and 300 police mobilised to keep the gates closed.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I said from 2,000 to 3,000, and I am quite sure that <Col N="441" /> is an underestimate from what I saw. It might be said, and it has been hinted, on the Government side, that these people are not genuinely looking for work.  That is not true.  Anybody who went among them and looked at them would know that they were men with hard hands genuinely looking for work and with no hope of getting it. I do not see this matter getting much publicity in the papers.  Certainly down in the West of Ireland it is not known.  Never in my time, and certainly not in the inter-Party Government's time &mdash; that desperate period in the history of Ireland, according to Fianna Fáil&mdash;was one single unemployed man seen outside the gates of Leinster House.  On the contrary, Fianna Fáil Ministers can look up the files and they will find that many works of development during our time had to be slowed down because there were not men to go to work on them. Deputy Davern may laugh, but I remember that the hydro-electric development works at Ballyshannon were in danger of completely closing down because men could not be found to do the work.  The Minister for Social Welfare can back me out in that, and any Fianna Fáil speaker can rise within the next hour&mdash;there is still time&mdash;if that statement is untrue.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Davern and Deputy Ó Briain, the Parliamentary Secretary, want to verify that, the figures are there.  It was in the summer period of the year.  I cannot remember what year, but there was a danger that the whole works would have to close down completely because there were not enough men to work them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> Among them were some of my own neighbours who enjoyed plenty of employment during the inter-Party Government's time, in Dublin, and they were men who were not afraid of a day's work and would work against men from any part of the country.  I saw some of them outside the gate yesterday, and certainly if they had a chance of coming in here I would not like to think of the tender way they would handle the Government.</P>

      <P>Unemployment has reached a position in this country where it has become dangerous.  I will not dwell further on it than that.  It is no longer something that can be joked about by the Government side of the House &mdash; where it seems to be a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with the unemployment situation is the increase in rates of interest for loans and agricultural credit for farmers.  It seems we simply must follow everything that the Government across the water does.  I will not repeat all I said on the occasion of the Budget of 1952, but I know that Budget was dictated across the water.  Mr. MacEntee went so far as to send a most warm letter to Mr. Butler on the occasion of his Budget. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British House of Commons this year gave reliefs to every single citizen of the British community.  Mr. MacEntee comes along, and what does he do?  He copper-fastens everything he did last year, and in addition, insists on every one of the Ministers of his Government &mdash; finishing up with Deputy Childers, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; contributing so much extra taxation towards what I might truly describe as a squeezing of extra revenue from the people.  All last summer and winter were taken up by this House with Minister after Minister coming in seeking additional money. <Col N="443" /> The Minister for Agriculture was the only exception.  He had no schemes to put forward to tax the farmers but he has got his marching orders from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to cut down on the land reclamation scheme.  I think he is asking £2,200,000 this year for reclamation but if Fianna Fáil are in office, of that £2,200,000 not much more than half will be spent on the farmers.  And Deputy Davern may take me up on that if he likes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>All these things have resulted in the biggest defeat of the whole lot &mdash; strangely enough &mdash; in Dublin North-West, in the city itself.  Even in the country, where the people have longer distances to come to the poll and where a number are indisposed and old&mdash;even there, a majority came out, and a very determined majority, to see that Fianna Fáil knew exactly what they were thinking.</P>
      <P>This motion of confidence in the Government, Sir, has been asked by the Taoiseach.  I want to say this: that the people of the country want that motion defeated.  It has been flung across the House that nobody on this side of the House wants an election. I think that Deputy Morrissey, speaking a few minutes ago, put it very decisively when he said: &ldquo;It is not what we want in this House that matters; it is what the people want that matters.&rdquo;  The people at the present time in my opinion want a chance to mark their ballot papers again.  I will not prophesy, as Deputy Dr. Browne apparently does, what way they will vote, but at the present time the people are clamouring for a chance to mark their ballot papers and I have not the slightest doubt what way the majority will mark these papers when they get a chance.  I hope they will get the chance soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to warn the Government&mdash; and there should be no need to warn them &mdash; that the greatest safety valve democracy has, is a general election. It gives the people a chance, if they are tired of the Government that is in, to put them out, and it gives a chance to the people to use in a constitutional <Col N="444" /> way the one weapon at their disposal.  It is a very dangerous experiment for a Government to try to hold on to office.  The last three by-elections should not have left any doubt in the mind of the Government as to what the people want.  Every time I go home to my constituency I meet many people and many previous supporters of Fianna Fáil among them and what they say is not: &ldquo;When are you going to have a general election?&rdquo; but I am asked: &ldquo;When are you going to put them out?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern and the Parliamentary Secretary may smile, but I think there will be a very different smile on their faces in a short time.  They are beginning to feel the blast very sharply now.  It is very evident on that side of the House.</P>
    <P>I was listening to most of the Taoiseach's speech on Tuesday and I was astonished that there was complete silence on the question of what they are going to do.</P>
    <P>In this motion of confidence the Taoiseach in effect says: &ldquo;I am Taoiseach.  Here is my Government. I have been carrying on for the last two or three years since I got into power in any old way I liked.  I want you to give me a vote of confidence to carry on in any old way I like for the future&rdquo;.  That is exactly what the Taoiseach asks the Dáil.  Neither himself nor the Tánaiste who is, I suppose, the principal spokesman for the Government, has given any indication of the plans they have for the relief of unemployment, how they propose to ease the cost of living, how they propose to put an end to the misery and poverty that have been brought into many homes, or what they propose to do about trade and business in the country.  The doors of every business premises in the country have been virtually closed as a result of Government policy.  Any Deputy who is in contact with shopkeepers must know that.  Shopkeepers make no secret of the fact that their customers, ordinary farmers and workers, who were able to buy food for decent meals during the period of office of the inter-Party Government and for a while after it left office, are buying most sparingly, in bits and scraps, now.  Shopkeepers have <Col N="445" /> told me that a great many of their customers, in the towns particularly, are not able to buy sufficient food for the maintenance of their families.</P>

That is a nice picture and it is about the best indication of how the public pulse is going. This is not a matter for laughing and joking.  It is a serious matter, particularly for the poor working man's wife, who sees her husband out of work and who has to depend on the £1 or £2 which he brings from the labour exchange, who sees her children badly clad, under-nourished and badly fed.

The last matter to which I should like to refer is the manner in which the Department that I administered during the period of office of the inter-Party Government is now being administered.  I refer to the Department of Lands and Forestry. About 1940 the operations of the Land Commission were brought to a standstill. The Land Commission were prohibited from resuming and acquiring land for the relief of congestion.  The staff were dissipated and scattered or were confined to merely routine work such as vesting.  When the inter-Party Government came into office, they were faced with the problem of removing the ban which had been imposed on the work of the Land Commission, somewhere, I think, about the 14th April, 1941.  I do not know whether that announcement was made through the Dáil or whether it was merely said that owing to the emergency the work of the Land Commission should stand over for a few years. I was not here at the time and I cannot say whether the House took that as a genuine excuse.  The war, however, finished in 1945 and in 1948, when we took office, the Order had not been revoked.  We know the way in which the Land Commission has been administered since.</P>

That was one of the drawbacks I had to contend with for the first 18 months, because the outdoor staff cannot be expected to take in a number of young men and in a short time turn them out as fully-fledged inspectors able to value land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of Government policy.  I am trying to deal with the policy of the Government in dealing with the Land Commission. Since they took over office, their policy has been a continuation of the policy which was operated for six or seven years prior to the advent of the inter-Party Government.  The present Minister is not acquiring any fresh land. He is using the pool of land which the commissioners acquired during my time.  He is using that pool and, apparently, having great fun in dividing it, but he is adding nothing to it, with the result that if there is another change of Government in a year's time or in two or three years' time, the incoming Minister will find things in the same condition as I found them in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, expenditure on the Forestry Department has been cut.  I shall not dwell on that further than to say that if it is the Government's wish to make a genuine effort to stop the flight from the land and to stop emigration from the western seaboard from Kerry to Donegal, they have no finer instrument in their hands to achieve that purpose than the implementation of the forestry programme which I left to Deputy Derrig when he took over <Col N="448" /> office on the 14th June two years ago.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government introduced the Undeveloped Areas Act but, so far as I can see, that Act is being used as nothing more or less than an electioneering stunt in order to bamboozle and fool the people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce here last night indicated that the Act is not working out as well as he thought it would.  He hopes that there will be 12 factories established west of the Shannon.  Again, that is a Fianna Fáil hope for the future&mdash;&ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  He said that 35 or 36 factories would be established in Dublin in the near future.  That is more centralisation. That is the be-all and the end-all of the famous Undeveloped Areas Act of which we had such hopes. He says that 15 projects are under consideration and he has hopes that 12 of these will materialise.</P>
    <P>For Deputy Killilea's information, I hope that they will materialise &mdash; more so than the biscuit factory for Ballina which the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised just a year ago. I suppose some people were fooled about that particular project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer now to a statement which the Tánaiste made in this House last night in relation to the butter subsidy.  I do not know why he made that statement.  He must be very well aware that it is a serious misstatement.  He said that it would take a subsidy of £1,000,000 to bring down the price of butter by ld.  That is altogether wrong.  I corrected him at the time he made the statement but yet he clung to his misstatement. Taking winter and summer production alike, it takes a little under three gallons of milk to produce a lb. of butter.  A penny a gallon on milk represents £1,000,000.  A sum of £1,000,000 devoted to the subsidy on butter would mean a reduction of 3d. in the lb.  I do not know why the Tánaiste insisted on making that misstatement last night unless it was for the purpose of scaring the people&mdash; seeing that, already, butter has gone up from 2/10 a lb. under the inter-Party <Col N="449" /> Government to 4/2 a lb. under the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;into believing that it will now take £16,000,000 to bring the price of butter down to the level at which it was during the inter-Party Government's term of office.  It will not take one third of that sum.  Butter has been taken off the tables of the working-class people, and their children are deprived of it. Those of them who are fortunate enough to be able to buy margarine are doing so.  We are now in the position that we have 60,000 to 70,000 cwt. of a butter surplus.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and those Deputies who sit on the Government side of the House consider that it is a great comfort to the working man and his wife and family to know that, although they are denied the lb. of butter, somewhere in this country there is a huge store of 60,000 to 70,000 cwt. of butter which they can look at but cannot buy.</P>

      <P>I will not be drawn along that line, good, bad or indifferent. I am sticking to one thing and that is that the people of this country consumed 760,000 cwt. of butter each year under the inter-Party Government. They were able to buy it and, thank God, they were able to eat it. Along with that, we had to import butter.  What is the position to-day?</P>

      <P>You imported the New Zealand butter, the yellow butter, <Col N="450" /> which received so much adverse criticism while the inter-Party Government were in office.  You are imposing that imported butter on Dublin and on a radius around Dublin&mdash;so much so that the people there cannot buy a lb. of Irish creamery butter.  But the people can read that, somewhere, in cold storage&mdash;probably on a ship on the Liffey&mdash;there are between 60,000 and 70,000 cwt. of the best Irish creamery butter.  I suppose that, sooner or later, the English people will be subsidised, as they were before&mdash;in other words, bribed&mdash;to eat the butter which our own people are denied.  It is like the extra £20,000,000 worth of food, meat and so forth that was exported and that represents an increase in our exports.</P>

Some Deputy may try to argue from what I have said that I am opposed to increased agricultural exports.  I am not.  I should like to see this country exporting £200,000,000 worth of agricultural exports instead of £100,000,000 worth but, first of all, I want to see that our own people are adequately fed and then by all means export the surplus. So long as we deny it to our own people, we cannot call it a surplus.  I do not want to see food withheld from the tables of the working people and the poor in order to sell it abroad.  I always encourage every farmer in my constituency whom I meet to produce as much as he possibly can.  I always encourage him to knock as much as he can out of his land, and I am always prepared to give him any advice which I may be able to give him and which he may require.</P>

Deputy Lehane and Deputy Davern know the conditions that obtained under the inter-Party Government.  I have not the slightest doubt that the prosperity that the people enjoyed at that time and a great deal of what might be called the just imposition of taxation will be restored to a large extent within a period of six months of the inter-Party Government's taking office again.</P>

      <P>I believe that the prosperity, the full employment and, above all else, the just imposition of taxation that obtained during the period of office of the inter-Party Government can be restored.  I think it can truthfully be said that, under the Coalition Government, we had the lowest ever number of discontented people.  I think that that happy position can be restored.</P>
      <P>If the present Government had implemented their 15-point programme&mdash; which was our policy &mdash; and took up where we left off, it is very difficult to say what the result of the recent by-elections would have been, but I feel certain that the motion which this House is now discussing would not have been necessary.  In other words, we should not be in the position in which we are to-day.  We would not have unemployed people marching up and down the streets of our city and bus loads of Gardaí protecting Leinster House for the first time in the history of this State and we should not have train loads of our youth flying the country.  We should not have 78,000 young men, between the ages of 15 and 45 years, fleeing from the land to take up occupations in our cities and towns and across the water.  All that has happened in the short period since 1946.</P>

We believe we can restore prosperity and go a long way towards stopping emigration.  The people in the recent by-elections have shown that they are angrily disposed towards the present Government and are determined to get shut of them. The unemployed marches are proof of that, together with the fact that Leinster House has to be guarded by a strong force of guards and military against the anger of the Dublin people. We believe that in a period of six months we can go a very long way towards restoring the prosperity the country enjoyed two years ago and will enjoy again in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, when concluding his speech, made an observation which I think deserves to be refuted.  He said that there were two Independent Deputies who support the Government because of a vicious spite against some other member of the House.  He also said that there was another Independent member who supports the Government because of a vicious hatred and spite against another member, and I take it he is referring to myself, <Col N="455" /> because over and over again the accusation has been made against me that I in some way bear hatred, ill-will or spite towards one member of the House.  I want to make it clear beyond all question that I have never borne any ill-will or hatred for any member of the House.  Every member of the House is my friend, and if any member is in need of any help I can give, he will get it.  I think it is an appalling thing that the leading Opposition Party, Fine Gael, and certain sections of the Press should concentrate on this campaign of abuse which seeks to represent a Deputy's policy and actions in this House as being inspired and motivated solely by personal ill-will and of hatred for another Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is true that, during the period of the inter-Party, I expressed strong disagreement with the policy pursued by the then Minister for Agriculture, but there was nothing personal in that opposition.  It was based on policy, and policy alone, and the records of the House will show that again and again during the administration of that Minister and that Government, ex-Deputy O'Reilly and myself, two Independent farmer Deputies, introduced motions designed to change that policy.  Let us hear no more of the suggestion that no Deputy can disagree with inter-Party policy unless he bears hatred, ill-will or spite to some member of that Government.  It is a vicious slander from the Independent Deputies &mdash; the same accusation has been directed against Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and Deputy Cowan.  I want to say that I resent it and that it should not be repeated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin last night raised the tone of the debate.  He raised it to a certain extent above the gutter by concentrating upon the issues before us in a serious way.  He spoke of the difficulties of a Party such as the Labour Party in a situation of the kind we have and he showed how difficult <Col N="456" /> it would be for them to support any Party.  As he said, when you take a cat by the tail&mdash;I think he was referring to the Fine Gael Party&mdash;it is often very hard to let go.  He thereby indicated a certain difficulty that faces the country.  There are people who say that this motion should not be put to the House, that the Government should go to the country.  The only purpose of going to the country would be to secure a change of Government. If the Government went to the country and secured their return to power, it would mean that the same policy would be continued, so I take it that those people who appeal for a general election, whether genuinely or not, are asking for a change of Government. I would like to examine this question to find out what would happen if there was a general election and if the present Government was to become a minority.  Would we immediately have an alternative Government, with a policy and programme, capable of taking over the reins of administration?</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin very properly indicated that there is no certainty of any such thing.  He said that his Party would put a programme forward and submit a programme to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and, if that programme was accepted by either, they would then give conditional support to the Party that accepted it.  After an election, therefore, we would have a long period of uncertainty and unrest, a period during which the Labour Party and Fine Gael would be fighting out the various issues between themselves. Deputy Larkin said that during the period of the inter-Party Government the Fine Gael Party worked in the broad light of day and in the darkness of the night to undermine and destroy the Labour Party.  In face of that it is quite evident that Deputy Larkin is not likely in the event of an opportunity arising to form another inter-Party Government to make as soft a bargain as he did in 1948.  At that time Fine Gael gained a certain number of seats and the Labour Party lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour came out of the experiment very badly.  That is in accord with the history of Fine Gael.  Fine Gael is a <Col N="457" /> kind of political Christie.  They have a cupboard filled chock-full of the skeletons of the small Parties that tried to help them out and put them into power.  They have the remains of a number of Farmers' Parties that they gobbled up and destroyed.  That is the policy they have pursued all down the years.  I take it they are determined to continue with that policy right to the end.</P>
    <P>Now, the Labour Party has some sort of leadership.  I do not think there is any leadership in Clann na Talmhan judging from our experience here to-day. Because the Labour Party has some leadership they will fight for their existence and not allow themselves to become skeletons in this political Christie's cupboard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be very creditable to the Fine Gael Party, but it is nevertheless true.  They have destroyed their allies one by one. Clann na Poblachta came into this House, a strong, virile, vigorous Party of 10 or 11 members.  At the end of the inter-Party régime there was nothing but the head and the tail. They were just the same as a herring that hunted with a hungry cat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach opened this debate in his usual moderate and restrained way. He outlined the difficulties the country has experienced in building up and sustaining the nation.  Whether or not we agree with him on everything, every Deputy must acknowledge that the Taoiseach is by far the ablest Leader this country has produced.  He has great moral and physical courage, but it is not that alone that has marked him out.  It is the fact that not only has he shown the moral courage and the necessary ability but he has also had patience, perseverance and <Col N="458" /> vigilance in watching the nation's long-term interests and safeguarding them.  He has sustained this nation against attack from outside and against the danger of want in time of emergency.  He has sustained it against involvement in war.  For that reason he deserves to be treated with respect.</P>
    <P>One characteristic marks out the Opposition and that is its animosity, towards the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach's integrity has enabled this nation to become a free nation and to become firmly established as such.  For that reason I think it is only right that his Government should be given an opportunity of proving that its policy over the last two years is from the long-term national point of view the safest and the best policy for the nation.</P>
    <P>What is the alternative offered by the Opposition?  It is nothing but a medley of conflicting and discordant suggestions from a number of Parties with conflicting interests.  They have declared their intention not to prepare an agreed policy and put that policy before the nation.  They are prepared to go to the country with rival policies. Should they prove successful they will resort to bargaining in relation to ministerial office.  They may reach some kind of hotch-potch agreement which will enable them to carry on for some time.  That was the history of the three and a half years of inter-Party Government.  I know it because I was endeavouring during that time to secure something in the nature of a sound national policy.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who agreed with the proposal that an attempt should be made to form an all-Party national Government.  I recognised from the outset that the first fundamental for the establishment of such a Government was fair play and goodwill on the part of those who held ministerial office.  Time and time again here we had one Minister who maliciously defamed his predecessors; one Minister more than any other was the chief culprit in that respect.  I knew it was impossible in those circumstances to look forward to a national Government because Party politics and political partisanship were the main issues of <Col N="459" /> that particular Minister and some of his colleagues.  The Labour members of the inter-Party Government have a fairly creditable record in that respect. Unfortunately for me I had a share in putting one Independent Minister into office and he was the Minister who from the very outset misrepresented the position in which he found the country when he took office and misrepresented the position in relation to agriculture thereby seeking to defame and destroy, if possible, the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still Deputy for the County Wicklow and you may find that for a very long time hence I shall still be Deputy for the County Wicklow with God's help and if I have my health.  Since I have referred to health, I should like to say that I never listened to a more disgraceful statement than that made by the Leader or whatever he is of the Fine Gael Party.  He said that on this vote the Division Lobbies would be turned into hospital corridors.  He suggested that it was a shameful and disgraceful thing for a man to suffer illness.  Good health is a blessing which we all hold from the Almighty.  We enjoy it from day to day, from hour to hour, or even from one moment to another.  We do not know how long we may enjoy health and we do not know how soon we may be deprived of it but no man with any sense of decency would insult or offend a man who lost his health.  The ex-Taoiseach was the one man who availed of a stretcher to bring one of his supporters into this House and there was not one opponent of the ex-Taoiseach's <Col N="460" /> who said a disrespectful word to that man when he was brought into the House.</P>
      <P>I myself on that occasion had a deeper respect for that particular Deputy than I ever had before or since when I saw him come to cast his vote under great difficulties.  If any citizen had to walk on a crutch through the poorest street in Dublin, you could take it that the lowliest loafer on the street would not offend or insult him. It was left to a leader of a political Party to spit upon any unfortunate Deputy who might have to be brought into the House to vote regardless of which side he might vote for.</P>
      <P>The ex-Taoiseach made another statement which could hardly be allowed to pass.  He spoke of two disreputable Independent Deputies upon whom the Government might have to depend on this vote.  What right on earth has Deputy John Costello to describe any Deputy as being disreputable? What is his own record? What is the record of his colleagues? Let him look at the responsible Ministers he had assisting him when he was head of the Government.  Let him look at General Mulcahy whose feast day is celebrated on the 8th December.</P>

      <P>Let him look at Field-Marshal Everett who achieved fame in the battle of Baltinglass.  Let him look into the mirror and see the man who solemnly pledged himself, when seeking office, that he would uphold the connection between this country and the British Commonwealth and who availed of the first opportunity, whether under pressure or otherwise, to sever the last link with that Commonwealth.  Could the man who so shamefully broke faith with his own supporters and with the people throughout the length and breadth of the country look into the mirror and describe himself as reputable?  How could such a man dare accuse other Deputies of being disreputable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this House are proud of their reputations, proud of their status <Col N="461" /> as honourable representatives of the people.  We try to carry out in the spirit and in the letter the policy which we advocated.  I have always advocated a progressive national and agricultural policy.  I must say that I have great respect for Deputy Larkin, particularly when he speaks in this House.  He speaks with moderation and restraint, but I think he errs slightly when he refers to me as being conservative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>As Professor Joad used to say, it all depends on what you mean by conservative.  If conservatism means conserving or preserving the things that are good and desirable in Irish life, then by all means am I conservative, but if it means opposing reform, opposing improvement and opposing an improvement in the standard of life of our people, then I most emphatically protest against being described as a conservative.  If we were to go into questions of policy, I think Deputy Larkin would find that I am at least as progressive in my outlook as any Deputy in this House.  I believe that every boy and girl reared in this country ought to have a reasonable prospect of obtaining employment within this country and a decent home in which to live and enjoy the ordinary comforts of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would always be prepared to support any action on the part of the State to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of all people securing full employment.  I was interested to learn that a speaker, on behalf of the demonstration of unemployed workers in the city yesterday, declared that he had no confidence in the present Government, but he also said that they did not want Fine Gael.  So it seems that there is a fairly strong feeling in this country that the removal of the present Government would not solve our economic and social difficulties. The Taoiseach was right, and so was Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, when they indicated that this Dáil was elected for a period of five years by the electorate.  This <Col N="462" /> Dáil is entitled to take that period in order to carry out its programme, the programme on which the majority of its members are agreed.</P>
    <P>This Dáil has a perfect right to do that if it so desires.  This is the Parliament of the nation.  Sooner or later this Parliament must render an account to the people.  It must give its account within a period of five years and it may, if it so desires, present that account within a shorter period.  That is a matter for the Dáil itself and for the Government.  Therefore, there is no merit in the suggestion that this Dáil has no right to propose a vote of confidence in the Government.  We have got to ask ourselves what is this vote of confidence.  It is a vote of confidence in the present Government. We have also got to ask ourselves what would be the net result of our action in voting against this motion.  It would be a vote of confidence in the Opposition. Is there any Deputy on any side of the House who could have confidence in men like Deputy Costello, Deputy Donnellan, who has grown a little, Deputy Blowick, or the Leader of the Labour Party who is trying to save his small Party from being eaten up and destroyed by that devouring monster, Fine Gael?</P>
    <P>I want to say that I believe we will be in a better position to judge the policy of the present Government when it has been carried out to its fullest extent.  I believe that the country is in an improving condition. That is true, particularly of agriculture. One would think, listening to some of the silly speakers and some of the legal gentlemen we have in this House, that agriculture was in a state of decline and decay.  I have never known agriculture to offer better prospects to the farmer than it does at the present time.  Since the change of Government two years ago, the price of milk has been increased by almost 3d. per gallon, the price of wheat has been increased by 17/- per barrel, and the price of beet has been substantially increased by 11/- or 12/- a ton.  In the last year of the inter-Party Government we were devoting £500,000 to land reclamation and improvement, while in the present year we have voted £3,000,000 for the same purpose, thereby <Col N="463" /> indicating clearly that there is a progressive policy in operation in regard to agriculture.  Since agriculture is the basis and foundation of our whole economic system, there is hope that we may see a further substantial improvement in conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House much longer since I know there are other speakers to follow, but I think that anyone who views the issue fairly will acknowledge that this vote of confidence by Dáil Éireann is justifiable in present circumstances.  It remains for the Government, having secured this vote of confidence from the Dáil, to press froward with its programme of national development as rapidly as possible.  I believe, in spite of my conservatism, that there is a good deal of further employment which the Government could give.  Bord na Móna has proved to be a source of very substantial employment for our workers. Work in regard to afforestation and schemes of that kind should be pushed forward as rapidly as possible so that employment may be provided on a very substantial scale.  No one wants to see any decent citizen, who is able and willing to work, in the position in which he is unable to secure employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact in regard to the Central Bank, as every Deputy of the House is aware, is that when it asked in its report for a cutting down on works of capital development, the Government repudiated that suggestion most emphatically, and instead of cutting down on works of capital development, the Government very substantially increased expenditure on these works in the present year to a figure of over £40,000,000.  That sum of money is being raised by the State on the security of the taxpayer and is being expended on works of capital development.  I am in favour of extending that still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in the course of his speech, dealt with the housing problem and suggested that, as far as it relates to local authority schemes, it is on the <Col N="464" /> way to being solved.  I believe, however, that we should still further improve housing conditions in the rural areas.  I do not think it is right that any small working farmer should not have as decent a house as the workers in Ballyfermot or in any of those other city areas.  I am told that these corporation houses are very good houses. They are certainly very good if compared with the houses in which many of our small farmers are living to-day. Let us go ahead with works of improvement and development of that kind, works designed to provide employment and to raise the standard of living of our people and thereby induce our young men and young women to settle down in Ireland and establish homes here.  That is our objective.</P>
    <P>What is the objective of the Opposition &mdash;of Fine Gael?  In spite of everything that I could do when the inter-Party Government was in power, there was a ruthless cutting down of the area under tillage.  Last year, a campaign was organised by the Fine Gael Party to cut down the area under both wheat and beet.  This year, thank God, there is a substantial increase in the acreage under these two crops.  The people, in spite of Fine Gael and of everything they could do to hold them down and drive them into panic, to bewilder them and confuse them, are settling down and are determined to go ahead.  I think that is what we all desire.  We have a so-called Republican paper, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in which a gentlemen named Skinner writes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This whole campaign is designed to prevent recovery, to prevent an improvement in the economic and business life of this country, to create confusion, discontent and uneasiness amongst our people.  I think it is time that that kind of sabotage of our national economy was brought to a close.  It is time that people should adopt a more responsible attitude.  Our farming industry, as I have said, is improving and is capable of still greater improvement.  The business life of the community is very sensitive to alarms of that kind.  They disturb the people's minds.  What we need is to restore confidence in our business people so that they will be enabled to provide further opportunities for employment for our people.</P>
      <P>The people who are opposed to the present Government, and want to climb into office by hook or by crook, do not want the employment problem solved or more people put into permanent employment, and neither do they want to see the economic situation of the country improved.  What they want is confusion and chaos in order to exploit it.  I think, however, that the people are beginning to size up Fine Gael in that respect.  They are beginning to see that they are nothing more than a Party of political opportunists who are mad for ministerial office and, if they can get it, are determined to keep it by any and every means at their disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If those people will keep quiet.  One of the statements made by Deputy Morrissey was that every farmer Deputy must acknowledge that the inter-Party Government brought prosperity to agriculture.  That statement was made very deliberately in the course of this debate.  The inter-Party Government had nothing whatever to do with any improvement that has taken place in agricultural conditions since 1947.  We all know that in 1947 we had a very severe winter and conditions were bad in the early summer of that year.  Nevertheless the prices of live stock, cattle and sheep, rose sharply, as every cattle trader and every farmer knows.  They rose during 1947, because of improved shipping conditions, to the level almost of the British price, and they have remained at that level ever since.  It had nothing to do with the 1948 Agreement. It did not matter who entered into that agreement.  The prices had risen before that agreement was signed and anyone who cares to go down to the Library and read the shipping statistics <Col N="467" /> or the prices of imports for that period will see that the price of cattle increased by almost 50 per cent. and in some cases by almost 100 per cent. in the latter half of 1947.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy knows that; yet we have certain politicians trying to cash in and seek to secure some kudos for themselves upon the assertion that they brought about agricultural prosperity. Any increased prosperity that has come is the natural result of the relaxing of wartime conditions restricting shipping and causing a world shortage of food supplies, particularly of animal products.  Whatever happens we can hope to look forward to that condition prevailing for a long time.  It does not matter what Government is in power, that will happen.  However, a Government can do immeasurable harm if we are to be influenced by the policy advocated by Deputy Dillon of cutting down the acreage under wheat, the acreage under beet and that of other cash crops for which there is a secure and permanent market.</P>
      <P>We may face some risks in regard to the export market at all times.  We never can control that market but at least we can control the home market and we can ensure that our farmers will obtain a reasonable return for their work.  The farmers all over the country are waking up to the importance of that market.  They are waking up to the value which the growing of wheat and particularly of beet has in their economy.  They know these crops provide the proper rotation which improves their soil and lays the foundation for better leas and better grasses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the things that make for improvement in the standard of living. Because those things are possible under the present Government, because they are not possible under the Opposition, I am determined to support this motion, and I hope the Government will continue with that policy of intensive development of agricultural and industrial resources because that is the only way in which they can provide a better standard of living for our people and better social services.  I hope they will also persist in improving social services in spite of any protests and <Col N="468" /> any opposition that may be offered by one section of the Opposition.  I believe in improving our social services.  They will have the support, not perhaps of the Fine Gael Party but the support of all progressive elements within the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been several questions in connection with this matter in the past few months.  Since the introduction of increases for adult dependents and children on the 7th July, 1952, 32,000 applications for such increases have been dealt with.  We are dealing with 40,000 insured persons a week.  Nine thousand of these cases are chronic and they have been segregated.  Very often the delays are due to the delay in <Col N="474" /> furnishing the medical certificate which is often not furnished in time.  We have to wait to see if the case is one that comes under workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that in fact there is delay.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider a provision whereby an employer would pay benefit when sickness occurs and be indemnified subsequently by the Department?  It is inexcusable that there should be a delay for two or three weeks in the case of people who are depending on some weekly sum.</P>

I might mention, however, <Col N="482" /> that in West Offaly, as in some other areas, there are limiting factors such as flooding caused by main rivers; and the prevalence of rock and dense scrub where the cost of clearing would be excessive and out of proportion to the value of the improvement which might be effected.</P>

Despite that, applicants who were amongst the original applicants in the county, whose applications have been in since the scheme went into operation in the county, have still failed to get any work done.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. As regards the second part of the question, as the Deputy is aware, the lorry service in this area, which is now in operation only for little more than a week, is of an experimental nature subject to variation from time to time if it is found in practice that such variation is necessary.  I would suggest to the Deputy that he should furnish to the Dairy Disposal Company the names and addresses of any farmers who he considers are not catered for on account of the present location of the lorry stop and I feel sure that the company will examine the whole position most carefully to ensure that the stop is arranged at the most suitable place for all concerned.</P>

    <Title>Motion of Confidence (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress I was referring to the <Col N="485" /> fact that as long as I was an Independent Farmers' Deputy in this House I took every opportunity to support proposals which I thought were for the welfare of the country whether they had been introduced by the Government or otherwise.  I intend to continue to follow that line of action.  I voted with the Government when it wanted to do something which I thought was right, sensible and serviceable to the people, and I voted against the Government when they introduced measures which in my opinion were against the welfare of the people and against the interests of the people of my constituency.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Government that as long as I am in this House I feel the Government have a responsibility to maintain law and order, and every Deputy in this House, I think, should give his full support to the Government in backing law and order in this State; and as long as I am in this House the Government may depend on me for full support in any steps they may have to take to ensure that law and order is maintained in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this vote of confidence I feel that the country is blistered with taxation, both national taxation, local taxation, direct taxation and indirect taxation.  Everybody is paying that taxation, and the so-called free services we are getting are proving to be an expensive luxury for the people of the country.  I cannot vote confidence in a Government that is involving itself in this very heavy expenditure.  I cannot vote confidence in a Government that dealt so stupidly with the milk producers early this year and because of their mishandling of the situation brought about a milk stoppage that inflicted hardships on a number of people.  I cannot vote confidence in a Government that went so far as to misinform the Taoiseach and to advise the Taoiseach in this House that I was telling an untruth when I was saying something that was perfectly true.  I refer to the occasion on which I asked the Taoiseach if he was aware that the Department of Agriculture had sent a letter to the Cork Milk Board, the <Col N="486" /> Creamery Milk Suppliers, the Dublin Milk Producers, the Federation of Milk Producers of Ireland and the Taoiseach said that I was quite wrong in stating that the Department's letter said that they would not consider the matter until &ldquo;next May&rdquo;.  I need not reply to that because the matter was featured in all the daily papers and the question I asked the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach's reply plus a photostatic copy of the letter written by the Department of Agriculture was published in the papers.</P>
    <P>If I were to vote confidence in the present Government I would feel that, to be logical, I should support every Bill that the Government have on the stocks at the moment.  I cannot do that.  I cannot support the Health Bill.  I cannot approve of the Bill that is proposed by the Minister for Local Government which will have the effect in County Cork of increasing taxation on a section of the ratepayers to the extent of £51,000 this year if it goes through.  If the Health Bill is enacted the rate demands will increase.</P>
    <P>I have these difficulties.  I think it would be a ridiculous position for me to vote confidence in a Government to-day and to vote to-morrow or after against Bills that are passing through this House or Bills that have been promulgated.</P>
    <P>As far as the Health Bill is concerned, I am opposed to it and I make no apology for that.  I am opposed to it principally on one ground, that is, that the Minister introduced a Health Bill and that 50 per cent. of the cost of it will have to be paid by the local ratepayers and the Minister and the Government will take all the kudos attaching to that.  If this House believes that that legislation is good legislation and decides to pass it, this House should find, and be responsible for, the money to put that legislation into operation.</P>
    <P>As far as the proposed Agricultural Rates Bill is concerned, it has one very dangerous feature.  At the moment the Minister for Finance is responsible for one-fifth of the rates on agricultural land of valuation over £20. Under the new proposal the Minister gets rid of that responsibility.  There <Col N="487" /> is this small deterrent at the moment to prevent Ministers from sending down Orders and instructions to local authorities to increase the rates.  That deterrent is that the Minister for Finance has to find one-fifth of the rates on agricultural land of valuation over £20.  Under the proposed legislation circulated to county councils by the Minister for Local Government that little deterrent is being removed. The Government will come into this House and do nice popular things as far as the people are concerned and then will send a flood of Orders to the local authorities to increase the rates and extract this money from the local ratepayers to pay for these services and they will say: &ldquo;We are grand fellows.  We are all for social services and social welfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot support the Government on the Health Bill and I cannot support the Government on the Agricultural Rates Bill.  I dislike the attitude of the Government in being responsible for the 19 days' milk stoppage by a stupid mishandling of the situation.  I also dislike the statement and attitude of the Minister for Finance when introducing his Budget.  The Minister said that taxation lies lightly on the land. Nobody but a Minister for Finance knows the degree of taxation that the land is paying in this country.  It is hidden taxation.  There is taxation on production.  There is taxation of about 8/- on every old hen that is exported out of this country at the moment. There is taxation on hides going out of this country in order to provide cheap hides for the tanners here to manufacture into leather and to sell in competition with the people across. All of it has the effect of reducing the value of the animal produced by the farmer.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be logical.  I have tried to explain my views sincerely and honestly.  I must come to the point of what is the alternative to the present Administration.  The alternative to the present Administration is a Labour-Fine Gael Administration.  I have not a great deal of hope that a Labour-Fine Gael Coalition will be of use to us in this country.  I cannot expect <Col N="488" /> a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition to give us any relief from this blistering burden of taxation that we have to suffer.  Fine Gael and Labour have been as lavish in their promises as Fianna Fáil.  There is a competition between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and Labour as to who will give most for nothing but the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; means a blistering burden of taxation on the people.</P>
    <P>I listened to the ex-Taoiseach when he spoke on the Health Bill.  His attitude to the Health Bill was that, even if faced with an expenditure of £8,000,000, £9,000,000, £10,000,000, they would not hesitate to support such a measure.  We have the Labour Party coming in and, as I mentioned when Deputy Morrissey was speaking to-day, the Labour Party are opposed to exports.</P>
    <P>According to the Official Report of 24th June, 1953, column 1937, a prominent Labour Deputy in this House said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The more we export, the higher automatically will be the home price whether it is for bacon, eggs, butter or something else.  The more we can send to Britain or elsewhere the more will the supply be curtailed automatically at home and the higher will the prices soar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a situation in this agricultural country in which the agricultural producer has to buy in a protected, inflated market.  He has to buy all his requirements at very much above their value and, on the other hand, he has got to sell his produce at world prices, if he is allowed to do it.  The Minister for Agriculture through Eggsports Limited, will put a levy of 1/- or 1/2 per lb. or about 8/- on every old hen.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will not let him sell the hide of a beast because he wants that hide given to Plunder and Pollak&mdash;I think they are very well named&mdash;in order that they can use that hide and sell it in competition with people who are paying the right price or the world price for these hides.</P>
    <P>What the Government are doing is bad enough, but we have the Labour Party, who will be part of the next Government with Fine Gael, who want to tax exports.  They want to compel <Col N="489" /> the Irish agricultural producer, the person who is keeping this country going, to pay top prices for everything he requires, and they want him to get an artificially depressed price for his products to a greater degree than the Fianna Fáil Government is doing at the moment.  That is the dilemma.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, speaking in this House on the Health Bill, said, as reported in column 58 of the Official Report for the 15th April, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmer with a valuation of £50 can go in his Chrysler car to avail himself of the provisions of this Bill while the bus driver living in a corporation house in Crumlin will derive no benefit under it.  The bank clerk, the commercial traveller and all those who come within the category of the middle classes earning over £600 per annum are not provided for in this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello thinks that farmers with £50 valuation and under are running around in Chrysler cars.  I have a valuation of, roughly, £70 and it gives me all I can do to run a Perfect. I would not even run a Prefect only I have to do it to get around among my constituents.</P>
    <P>I am in this difficult predicament between the two groups.  I thoroughly agree with the statement made by Deputy Morrissey, who said that this was a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; motion.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that it is a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; motion.  The only thing I am worried about is why this House has spent so long and why Deputy Morrissey spoke at such length discussing this &ldquo;cod&rdquo; motion.  Probably I am discussing it too long myself.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey that this is a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; motion. I would like to vote for a motion that would do something definite.  This motion commits the Opposition to nothing.  I would stay up night and day, week after week, with the Opposition to beat the Government on an issue that would commit the Opposition to something, but in voting <Col N="490" /> on a motion of this kind we are committing the Opposition to nothing.  It is, as Deputy Morrissey said, a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; motion.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about unemployment. Yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> had these headings: &ldquo;Unemployed March on the Dáil&rdquo;; &ldquo;Unemployed Sit Down on O'Connell Bridge&rdquo;.  It might be an unpopular thing to say, but it is quite easy for me to say it because I am regarded as a conservative reactionary, that we should decide that the figures we get with regard to the unemployed do not represent the number of unemployed.  We should divide these figures into three separate groups, first the unemployable group and let us treat them as unemployed. Let us, having regard to our social commitments, treat the unemployable as unemployed.  Let us treat the &ldquo;won't works&rdquo; as &ldquo;won't works&rdquo;, and let us treat the genuine unemployed as unemployed.  I suggest that these figures which we get of 80,000 and so many thousands every week and which are issued by the Statistical Department should be segregated to see how many genuine workers we have looking for work.  I have on occasions sat on the referee's court of the Labour Exchange in Cork and there were people coming in there who, it was quite obvious, were unemployed.</P>

      <P>I suggest that we have a false idea as to the number of unemployed. There are people in this country looking for work and wanting work. <Col N="491" /> I think that this unemployment problem can be dealt with easily and quickly by dividing what is at present taken as the unemployed group into the three categories I mentioned.</P>
      <P>I was interested in listening to my friend, Deputy Peadar Cowan.  Deputy Cowan wants progress.  He wants increased production, but he wants us to go back to the reaping hook and the scythe.  He wants increased agricultural production but he wants us to go back to the cow plough.</P>

      <P>I intervened last night when Deputy Cowan was speaking to point out that the only dual-purpose bovine animal I had ever heard of was the one in Germany that was under the plough on Monday and was used to drive the family to Mass on Sunday. If Deputy Cowan wants less hours for urban workers and automatic machines and conveniences and at the same time wants the country mugs to go back to the scythe and the reaping hook we are not going to get increased production.</P>
      <P>These are the few points I want to make on this vote of confidence.  When the vote is taken, I do not intend to vote for it because I believe with Deputy Morrissey that it is a cod motion.  But if the Opposition oppose any issue I will do the best I can to get as much support as possible for it. But as I say, this vote of confidence, as Deputy Morrissey said, is a cod motion.  It means nothing, and I for one am not going to vote for a cod motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why anybody in this House calls this a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; motion.  I think everyone in this House should welcome a motion of this nature because it gives an opportunity of airing our views and of discussing the very serious economic situation that exists at the moment.  It gives the Government a chance to review their policy in the past, and it gives the Opposition a chance to examine the steps which the Government has taken and to find out if they can put forward alternatives.  It is, therefore, <Col N="492" /> a great pity that a number of Deputies have overlooked the serious situation we are facing in this country. Since this Fianna Fáil Government came into power I have practically on all major issues supported them.  Therefore, in the few moments which are left now I would like to look back on some of the decisions and see if the Government had an alternative to imposing some of the hardships they did impose in the past two years.  When the Government took over office they had to deal with stockpiling and with the serious imports position.  I do not think there is anybody who will to-day deny that imports had to be cut down at that time not only from the point of view of the balance of payments but on the whole question of finding a market for Irish supplies and for the question of employment in the textile industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next issue which was extremely controversial and which caused the greater part of the hardships that have been imposed was the question of taxation in the 1952 Budget.  Had the present Government an alternative? Could the present Government possibly have raised less taxation than they did in 1952? Fine Gael told us that they would take £10,000,000 in ten minutes off the amount of revenue raised&mdash;does anybody seriously believe that is so, and would Fine Gael reaffirm here again to-day that they will do it?  I took the view then that the present Government had no alternative, and I still hold that view.  There is no doubt that revenue had not been meeting current expenditure.  It is perfectly definitely established, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that the 1951 Budget and some of the other Budgets were inadequate in the amount of revenue they produced.  Suppose the Government had taken a chance and introduced a Budget that did not balance, or suppose that they did not attempt to balance the Budget, and that an international economic crisis had occurred in the meantime&mdash;where would this country be, and where would the Government that had taken a chance in such circumstances be to-day?  It may be that there are different views as to how that situation <Col N="493" /> might have been met, but I cannot see how the Government could avoid increasing taxation at that particular time.</P>
    <P>It fell to the Government to implement the Social Welfare Act of their predecessors.  The Government had to face the extra expenditure which the Social Welfare Act involved.  It would have been an easy matter for this Government to turn round and do as their predecessors had done and put the Social Welfare Bill on the shelves and go from year to year promising it, saying it is only a matter of time. Then, you do not have to raise taxation, but you cannot have it both ways, and you cannot implement costly legislation and not raise the necessary money to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The Government reduced subsidies. Here in this House, I opposed the reduction of the subsidies, and as an Independent Deputy I did what I possibly could, and challenged the Opposition and asked them to give a clear indication that they would restore these subsidies.  Let me say if that guarantee was given I was fully prepared to defeat the Government if I could.  The Labour Party did pledge themselves to return the subsidies in full at that time, but I do not think they hold the same view now.  I have watched their pronouncements with interest in the recent by-elections and the restoration of the subsidy on butter was mentioned but I did not hear anything about any of the others.  Deputy Costello as ex-Taoiseach never replied to my question.  That has been the position of Independent Deputies in this House.  So far as the Opposition was concerned they were never given an opportunity to exercise their Independent mandate.  The Opposition here wanted to get government on the cheap.  That may be a good short-term policy.  It may work, but it is a very bad long-term one.  These are problems I am being blamed for here to-day as an Independent Deputy, and if the Opposition were returned these would be the problems later.  If the Opposition is returned with small Labour support the people will be asking Labour where are their subsidies and what is Labour going to say?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Deputy, I have had my trial.  It was perfectly obvious when this Government was formed that Independent Deputies were going to take a proportion of blame and responsibility and had no power to do otherwise.  I am not grumbling about that.  I could have turned on Fianna Fáil in the first instance and become one of those popular personalities and settled down to enjoying my position.  I did not choose to do that.  They have taken measures which I do not wholeheartedly agree with in some instances but on the major issues I do not see that they had any alternative and I have never seen any alternative put forward by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of capital expenditure was publicised very widely by the inter-Party Government.  Its significance was emphasised again and again. Fianna Fáil have continued that and they have continued the same budgetary system.  They raised a State loan in 1952.  They were buying capital in a dear market.  They decided to pay 5 per cent. for that.  I am sure they got very good advice before deciding that.  I do not think it was wise to pay that nor necessary.  I think the effect of that dear money had a very bad effect on local authorities and on private building and on practically every other capital project in which the State is involved at present.  I think that action combined with the restriction of credit was largely responsible for a considerable curtailment of employment.  I think that, so far as industry is concerned, the steps which the Government have taken have been responsible for increased unemployment. I believe that to avoid that, it would have been necessary for the Government to have taken unto itself greater powers, so far as the commercial banks are concerned&mdash;something which any Government, if they are going to undertake the solution of the problem of the under-development of the country, will have to face sooner or later.  Let us not overlook the fact that the Government by setting such <Col N="495" /> a very high price for State money have taken money from private enterprise. I think a lot of the money subscribed to the 5 per cent. loan for State purposes was money that would otherwise have been subscribed to finance private enterprise companies floated in the country.  The whole question of obtaining money for private enterprise has been affected to some extent by that action of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have put forward no alternatives for what the Government have done.  Their whole case stands on the fact that there were three good years of inter-Party Government.  Let me state quite clearly that the two or three years of relatively pleasant conditions under the inter-Party Government can be reproduced any time in this country.  How can it be done?  A Government comes into power, shelves all expensive legislation, puts their Social Welfare Bill and their Health Bill on the shelf and then begin to pour £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 of Marshall Aid into the economy of the country.  It can be done anywhere. There is no difficulty, no mystery in it.  I should like some information on this point.  If the Opposition gets back, unless they are prepared to borrow money, they are not going to be able to restore employment or to bring about recovery in the economic position of the country any quicker than the present Government can.</P>

They are endeavouring to capitalise on the difficulties of the present Government but yet they have not put forward one single alternative.  I do not deny that the present Government have made some mistakes but in looking back over the major issues I do not think they had any alternative.  However, there is a limited time at my disposal and I do not want to hold up the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that having regard to the serious economic difficulties of the country and the very unpleasant conditions <Col N="496" /> under which a number of people are living, I was amazed at Deputy Costello's speech.  As a novice in this House I do not want to make a personal attack upon him but I do not think that the Leader of an Opposition in any country in the world would make such a shallow speech in such serious circumstances.  It was a speech which contained nothing only abuse, abuse and sneering at Fianna Fáil and at the Independent Deputies who support them.  Deputy Costello's speech, so far as the future of the country is concerned, leads nowhere, absolutely nowhere.  Take his hypothesis about the demand for a general election.  The Government have lost a seat in Wicklow&mdash;the first seat they lost since they went back.</P>

      <P>Even assuming maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>, the Government could not win a seat in Wicklow at the by-election and to say that the fact that they did not win a seat which they could not win under P.R. deprives them of their constitutional mandate to govern this country is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged that we are supporting this vote of confidence because we are afraid to face an election.  So far as I am concerned that is absolutely untrue.  I shall face an election at any time but I shall not face an election to give a blank cheque to the Opposition. I would have supported the Opposition on several occasions and I would have preferred to be able to exercise my right to vote independently on many occasions. I never cared very much for the status of an Independent Deputy and I would have preferred, sometimes, if <Col N="497" /> I had been given an alternative but I have never been given that alternative. I suggest to Deputy Costello that on this occasion either he has given us no alternative to the present policy of the Government.</P>

May I point out to the Deputy who has just sat down and to the Independents, that they cannot contribute anything more to this decision than the country has given them and what the country has given them is a direction that this Government has no longer the confidence of the country?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that none of us, in face of the demand of the people, can vote for the Government here to-day&mdash;no member of Labour, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta or no Independent Deputy&mdash;because Deputies have no mandate to vote for a Government which has lost the confidence of the country, notwithstanding anything that the little lawyer Deputy from Dublin may say to the contrary.  In the five minutes I have at my disposal, I want to stress the point positively that a vote for this Government means a vote for more unemployment, and more marches in the city.  A vote in support of the present Government by Deputy Cogan, means that Deputy Cogan is voting for a reduction of the agricultural grant to farmers.  Deputy Cogan has put down a motion here disapproving of the proposal of the Government to reduce the agricultural grant, but yet he is going to vote for them.  Next week if that Government is in office, and I hope they will not, they will bring in an amendment to the existing Act providing for a reduction in the agricultural grant.  Deputy Lehane and other Deputies have put down a motion in relation to the price of milk.  What do they mean by that?  Are they going to vote now to give the Government a blank cheque to do the things to which these Deputies now object?  Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll says that he will not <Col N="498" /> vote with the Opposition unless he is given an indication of their policy. What greater indication can we give than we have given both to Labour, Clann na Talmhan and Clann na Poblachta voters in the three constituencies in which by-elections were held recently?  We have given it and the people have given their decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan would like to have attention drawn to himself.  I am not going to assist him in that.  Deputy MacEntee, the present Minister for Finance, said all the things about him that I could ever think of saying.  I do not have to add to that.  I want to address myself to these three constituencies&mdash;North-West Dublin, East Cork and Wicklow&mdash;for a vindication of the programme and policy of the inter-Party group.  The majority of the electorate in all three constituencies voted in no uncertain fashion for that programme, yet Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll says that we are looking for a blank cheque.  We are not.  We do not want a blank cheque. We have stated specifically what our programme is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will fulfil every promise that we have made.  It is not like the 15-point programme: promises are no sooner made by the Government than they are broken.  Yet Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll votes for that breach of the fundamental plank of his programme which was that the subsidies would be retained. We said in Limerick and in Waterford that we would restore the subsidies.  Believe it or not, the people of West Cork, in Limerick and in Waterford said to me: &ldquo;The Government will not take them off.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil supporters in Limerick City said to me: &ldquo;You are talking through your hat.  If the Government win these by-elections you can take it that the subsidies <Col N="499" /> will not be removed.&rdquo;  I regret to say that they were wrong and that time proved it.  Yet Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll is prepared to support it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess that some of the taunts and some of the shafts which have been hurled here at me on the basis of democracy and of the people's rights might have caused me to wince now and again did they come from other hands.  But when I thought of those who were hurling these taunts about democracy at me, they passed me by and left me untouched.</P>
      <P>We are told that because Fianna Fáil have lost a seat in a by-election or have lost votes in some by-elections we should give up the position which we occupy here in virtue of a majority of the House and that we should have a general election.  They told us we have no authority, if you please, because they can shout that we have lost some votes in by-elections.</P>
      <P>It is good for this country that we have some basis on which democracy can work and that it is not on the basis of those who can shout loudest or on the basis of those who can take a constituency here and there and interpret the will of the people by the results of the elections in those constituencies. We won two out of three by-elections and how did the gentlemen who are attacking us now interpret them?  According to the Leader of Fine Gael, the people were blind and ignorant.  When fortune happens to blow in their favour a bit, they will interpret it as the will of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Constitution, as was pointed out here by one of the speakers.  The basis of our democracy is a representative democracy.  We are not like some of the cantons of Switzerland where questions are decided by an immediate vote of the people.  For obvious reasons, we did <Col N="501" /> not choose such a system.  The system that is in our Constitution is the system of a representative democracy, this is, a House of representatives. As long as we do not exceed the time which is set out in the Constitution, which was enacted by the Irish people, and do not exceed the time which is settled by law, we are acting in accordance with the fundamental law decided by the Irish people themselves.</P>
    <P>We are accused, because we happen to have but a slight majority in this House, of being unrepresentative. After the election in 1948, the Parties came into this House after making their bargains behind the backs of the people, thus denying the people the right which was read out to us here by one of the Deputies on the opposite benches&mdash;the right of deciding, in final appeal, all questions of national policy in accordance with the common good.  That right is enshrined in Article 6 of the Constitution.  They took very good care that they did not give the people an opportunity of deciding because they did not come with the policy to the people which would enable them to choose between one and the other.  Time after time I have said&mdash;I even said it to-day while a Deputy was speaking&mdash;that the Labour Party have a perfect right to go and join up with Fine Gael if they want to, or with Deputy Lehane, if they want to, and produce a common policy and go with that policy before the country.  Then the people will not be denied their right to decide national issues in final appeal at election times.</P>
    <P>After the 1948 election, when we were on these benches, we challenged the people who had met behind the people's backs and formed a Government. There was not much talk about a general election then.  At that time, it was rumoured that if we got back into office we would have a general election shortly afterwards and put the matter to the test.  If we had, I, at any rate, would go to my grave believing that if it had been put to a test at that time the people who had been deceived from the platforms of several of the Parties would have given a good and quick answer to the people who had deceived them.  Who, having <Col N="502" /> listened to the election speeches of that period, would have thought that Clann na Talmhan were going to coalesce with Fine Gael?  Who would have thought that the Independent Labour group were going to coalesce with Fine Gael?  Who would have thought, at any rate any of us who watched the Labour leaders point a finger of scorn at the reactionaries in the opposition benches, that they were going to form a Coalition with them? The electorate did not know it and the electorate at these by-elections did not know what policy these various Parties stood for.  You might as well add Deputy Larkin's vote to Deputy Lehane's vote.  Is it democracy that these votes should be cast on the same side?  Do they stand for the same thing as far as policy is concerned? They can of course, unite&mdash;they have a perfect right to do so&mdash;in turning out the Government, if they want to, but when those who are now so loud in taunting us that we are not going to the people sat here and when there was a good reason for going to the people, their answer was a smile and a statement: &ldquo;We have a majority in the House and so long as we have a majority we are going to stay on.&rdquo; They regarded it as a national duty to do so.  We were told by the Leader of the Opposition about the torments of office and of how dead-sea like are the fruits of office and I am sure he must often have asked himself: &ldquo;Is it not strange why so many of us are looking for it, that we all somehow or other are striving for it?&rdquo; There must be some reward and we have acknowledged what the reward was.</P>
    <P>We are unashamedly saying that, if we are supported by a majority of the House, we should be glad to remain as Government, but if the majority, in their right, wish to turn us out, we shall just as happily and, if you like, as resignedly, go into opposition as we did before; but we want to know where we stand and the purpose of this motion is to determine the thing which has to be determined&mdash;whether we have or have not the confidence of the members of the House as a Government, given responsibility for the direction of public affairs, whether they want us or not.  In the last resort, the <Col N="503" /> Government so far as this House is concerned, is a committee of the House, responsible to the House, which can be turned out at any moment.  That is the Constitution and if we are turned out of office, we shall accept the verdict of the House and accept that the House does not want us.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that it does not matter what the House does, that the responsibility for an election lies with one individual.  That is true and that responsibility has not even to be shared with the Government.  If the Taoiseach is supported by a majority of the House, he can at any time go to the President and ask for a dissolution. If, on the other hand, he is defeated, then, the decision is out of his hands and lies with the President.  The natural thing for the President to do in such case is to consider the circumstances and make his decision.  In moving the motion, I repeated what we said when we took office that, if we are supported by a majority in the Dáil, we shall continue to carry on with our programme so long as that condition obtains and within the period set down by the Constitution or by the law under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have said that I have not been affected by the talks about democracy here.  It has been pointed out by Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll that everybody knows that, under proportional representation, if you hold only one seat in a three-seat constituency, unless there is a tremendous change of public opinion, you cannot retain that seat in a by-election, and the very fact that that is true is one of the reasons why the theorists who are fond of proportional representation always object to having by-elections determined in that way.  The feeling is that the purpose of proportional representation is to get a whole assembly that will appear to be representative of opinion in the country and when a Party which has one-third of the representation of a constituency loses it at a by-election, that constituency is not proportionally represented in the assembly.</P>
    <P>It is so well known that only Fine Gael would try to make use of the situation in the way in which they have <Col N="504" /> tried to make use of it in this case, but we have come here because we know there are people who would be misled by cries of that sort.  What we want to make certain of, anyhow, is that here, in the representative assembly, so long as we remain the Government, we shall have the confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people.  The day we have not got that confidence, they will show it to us by defeating us.  They have the opportunity of doing so at present, if they want to.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is remarkable to hear Fine Gael as champions of democracy. I have pointed out what they did after the 1948 election and really, when one thinks of the Blueshirts, one realises that there was not much democracy about them, nor was there much democracy about the statements made in this House that the Blackshirts had succeeded in Italy, the Brownshirts had succeeded in Germany and the Blueshirts would succeed here.  There was not much talk of democracy or of appeals to the people then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to the questions of public interest.  It has been said by many of the speakers on the Opposition side that we are responsible for a number of things that have happened here for which we are not responsible and could not, in the nature of things, be responsible.  We are told that we are responsible for the restriction of bank credit.  We are not in any way responsible for the restriction of bank credit.  I know that there are people here who want to nationalise the banks.  Very well&mdash;let them go to the people with that policy of nationalising the banks.  We have set down our principles in the Constitution even on that matter and we have said that, in all that appertains to the control of credit, the fundamental and primary aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.  We have put that as <Col N="505" /> primary duty also for consideration by the Central Bank.  It is said that we have adopted the policy of the Central Bank.  We have not adopted the policy of the Central Bank.  Had we done so, we would have acted quite differently from the manner in which we have acted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have looked for a surplus Budget, the type of Budget that it was suggested from the opposite benches we were out to get.  We would have ceased public works and a number of other things. It is plain for anyone to see that we are not following the policy of the Central Bank.  I have in my day read as much, one way or another, about financial credit theories as most people and I have come back in the end to the fundamental principle that the ordinary common sense rules which govern private families and private individuals in relation to their income and expenditure and the manner in which they utilise their reserves give, in the long run, the best results.  If it appeared that there was not enough ordinary purchasing power in the country to enable the people to buy the goods they wanted and that were obtainable, I can assure the House we would take just as strong measures to remedy that situation as we have taken to deal with the situation with which we found ourselves confronted.</P>
      <P>We came into office in a peculiar situation following on a particular world condition.  That situation was not just confined to this country.  Prices were not rising only in this country. Neither was the rush to stock up in the fear of war confined only to this country.  These things were paralleled in almost every other country in the world and every other country has suffered practically parallel results.  I pointed out in my opening speech that in practically every country there were identical results from that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Starting about 1950 with the outbreak of war in Korea prices began to increase.  The price of basic raw materials went up.  Following on that import prices went up and that condition of affairs obtained consistently <Col N="506" /> from 1950 until about September, 1951. About 40 per cent. of our personal income is attributable to imported goods.  It is obvious, therefore, that if the prices of imported goods go up the prices of commodities made out of these goods or the commodities themselves will go up by that amount, plus some further amount because of various margins and so forth for which allowance has to be made here from the domestic point of view.</P>
    <P>Imports prices went up.  The increase in import prices followed the increase in world raw material prices. There was a lag between them and, in fact, import prices here reached their maximum round about September, 1951.  I think they were about 33 per cent., nearly one-third, above the figure at which they stood prior to the outbreak of the Korean war.  It was quite obvious from that that prices would go up here and, of course, they did go up here.  They did not wait for the coming into office of the Fianna Fáil Government and restrictive financial policies, as has been suggested here.  Taking a base of 100, the cost of living had already gone up to 109 as a result of some of these changes in prices before we actually came into office.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we had to shake up the Government at the time.  The Government at the time wanted to bury its head in the sand and pretend that prices were not rising.  We had several debates here in an endeavour to convince the Government of the day that prices were rising and that the situation might become serious.  We came into office in 1951, just after the time of the introduction of the Budget in that year.  We found ourselves confronted with an extraordinary situation.  On the one hand prices were rising and, on the other hand, there was an unbalanced Budget.  The question was: &ldquo;How would we deal with that situation?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, import prices reached their maximum at about 33? per cent. above what they had been at the beginning of the Korean War.  Agricultural prices had also gone up.  When we talk about increased prices, let us not forget that if we have to pay increased prices for agricultural produce, in order <Col N="507" /> that the producer may get a fair return, prices are bound to go up.  To-day we had the spectacle of one group accusing us because the prices of milk and butter have advanced and, in consequence of that, there is a two-point increase in the cost of living.  On the other hand, we are accused by Deputy Lehane because we did not give in at once and accept the milk suppliers' view of what they should get.  We intended to sit down and act as judicially and impartially as we could between the two sections, between the producers on the one hand and the consumers on the other.  Of course, as the Irish proverb says: Those who come in between get it from both sides.  We came in between.  We tried to arbitrate between the producer and the consumer. We tried to ensure that the producer would get a fair return, a return sufficient to induce him to continue the economic service he was rendering of producing milk and having it available for consumption by our people in the cities and towns.  It was also essential that the creameries should get sufficient to enable them to continue in operation and produce butter.</P>
    <P>Despite that, should we happen to have an election one set of Deputies will go down to the milk-producing areas and denounce the Government, as no doubt Deputy Lehane would, because they did not give more or because they were too slow in meeting the demand of the producers for increased prices.  In a city constituency, such as Dublin North-West, prospective candidates will denounce us for having allowed the price of butter to go up. Yet we cannot increase the price of milk without increasing the price of butter.</P>
    <P>In the general interest it would be better from the point of view of economics if these things settled themselves. It would be better if the rewards which the various sections of the community get could be determined on ordinary commonsense lines, with the Government and the State standing back but ensuring that there is no unfair competition and that the weakest is not driven to the wall.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to the question as to what our general social attitude <Col N="508" /> is.  As far as I am concerned, I am not aware of any change that has taken place since I first came into politics. I went down&mdash;how many years ago?&mdash; to East Clare and preached there the Sinn Féin policy.  I believed at that time that it was the best policy for the nation as a whole.  I have stood by that policy consistently.  I regard it as the basic principle on which to judge all policies.  That policy is to produce here everything that we can produce ourselves; to give as much employment as possible in the production of these goods to our own people; to import nothing that we can produce ourselves and, in so far as imports are concerned, to bring in only the rawest of raw materials and let all the processing as far as possible be done here.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Dillon and the other free traders have never agreed with that.  I know that their policy is the old free trade system of a century or so ago&mdash;the old British liberal idea. That was the policy we fought and fought successfully.  I believe the policy we are pursuing is the best policy for this country to-day, as it was the best policy 20, 30 or 40 years ago. It is just as sound to-day as it was then.  It is on the basis of that policy we have been working.  It is on the basis of that policy that extra employment has been provided for our people. It is true people have gone off the land but I will not agree that they have gone because of anything that might have resulted from the establishment of industries here.  I do not think the setting up of industries here has driven anybody off the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I tried to point out to the farmers, there should be no antagonism between them and the people living in towns.  If there are six children on a small farm we know that four on an average will have to find employment off the land.  Deputy Cowan's idea was that we should deal with our farms in a certain way but I am not accepting that.  If you have six children in a small family on the land and they cannot get a place elsewhere on the land, four of these six children will have to find employment off the land. Looking back on life generally and trying <Col N="509" /> to philosophise on the meaning, the nature and conduct of it, I think that life in the country for the average man is fuller than he is likely to experience elsewhere.  I might be asked why I did not live in the country but the point is that very often for one reason or another you are tied to certain conditions, but whatever length of life is left to me, politically or otherwise, I shall devote that portion of my life trying to improve agricultural conditions in this country so that there may be greater opportunities, if possible by increased production, for people living in the rural parts, so that they may be prevented from flocking to the cities.  That will be my aim.</P>
    <P>We have not been responsible for the increase in prices.  The cost of living has now gone up to 126 points. Of those 126 points there are only seven for which we could be held directly responsible.  We are not shirking the responsibility that seven of these points have gone up as a result of the withdrawal of the subsidies.  The history of the subsidies is most interesting particularly so far as the Labour Party is concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, prices were rising rapidly in 1947.  We were able to maintain a certain amount of stabilisation.  Of course, one of the chief counts against us by the Labour Party was that we tried to keep things level during the war.  We did that in the supreme conviction that by keeping prices and all that was associated with them level so far as was within our power to do so we were looking to the best interests of the community from the economic point of view and that in particular we were doing it in the interests of Labour.  When prices and wages are not stable there are lags of various kinds.  The result is that in the long run these variations affect the Labour sections, who suffer most.</P>
    <P>Better work is done and there are more settled conditions generally if you can keep prices level.  When prices are falling there is, as a rule, a general inhibition to activity because manufacturers do not want to manufacture as they feel that when the goods go on the market they will lose.  Nobody wants to get in stocks under these conditions <Col N="510" /> because they feel they will lose as a result.  Lower prices are bad for business generally.  Therefore, in general the best thing to aim at from the economic aspect, if you want progress and results, is to try, in so far as it is in your power to do so, to keep prices level.</P>
    <P>We brought in the food subsidies in 1947.  We tried to prevent the cost of living rising and, I think, we brought it down by as much as 13 points.  We brought the price of tea down from 4/10 to 2/8 a lb. and the price of sugar from 6d. to 4d. a lb.  Butter and a number of other commodities were already subsidised.  We thought that, as a result, the one section of the community that would have appreciated our action and supported us in that would have been the Labour Party.</P>

That has been our attitude.  The Labour Party put us into power.  When we came in in 1932 we did not have an overall majority but if the Labour Party had gone with Cumann na nGaedheal or joined up with it or some other Party they could have formed a Coalition if they wanted to.</P>

He said, as I expected, <Col N="511" /> that they would work independently. It had been up to that time definitely stated by the Labour Party that that was their programme.  I said that I would also prefer that situation. After that I never begged the Labour Party to support us in regard to anything. It has been said that I went to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason why I went to the country in 1933 was because we had engaged in a struggle which was going to test our people to the utmost and which was possibly going to bring a good deal of suffering on them and I wanted them to know at the start where exactly they were going. It had been suggested to us that we were engaging in false pretences. After 1933 nobody could say that our fight to get a free Constitution and to retain the annuities was not a fight which was approved of by the Irish people.  In 1938 we went to the country because we were beaten on a vote here.  I wanted to have a strong Government if I could.  I am not going to pretend for one moment that a slight majority of one or two is a strong Government any more than the previous Government was a strong Government.  If a Government has to take unpalatable decisions for itself and unpopular for the country in doing their duty to safeguard the public interest you do want to have a certain amount of strength.  You cannot depend on somebody not getting a sudden attack of pneumonia or something else. The Government of course, is a weak Government.  Thank God&mdash;and in this respect the country ought to be glad too&mdash;that when we came back in 1938 we came back with an over-all majority which enabled us to take the measures which we considered wise in the country's interest and we stood up against all the pressure that was brought from elsewhere.  We would not have been able to do that if we had a Party which depended upon the <Col N="512" /> vote of Deputy Dillon or somebody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to pretend that, under these conditions, we are a strong Government, but as long as we represent the majority of the Dáil we shall carry on in the firm belief that no stronger one can be got here.  In regard then to our policy, we are not following the Central Bank or anybody else.  Coming back to the decision that faced us in 1947, we had to put up subsidies and we had to provide for them.  Is it going to be suggested by the Labour Party, or anybody else, that we should borrow the money that was necessary to meet year after year the subsidies on food?  If we are not going to borrow then we must provide for them through taxation, and there is the question all the time, which is going to be the more profitable and the better for the community.  Is it better to have subsidies with the taxation that is necessary to support them or have neither subsidies nor the taxation involved.  The Labour Party in 1947 took up the position that the subsidies were not worth the taxes that were put on beer, spirits and tobacco.</P>
      <P>I thought at least that the housewife would appreciate that she was getting bread cheaper, was getting tea cheaper and was getting sugar cheaper. When I tried to show how much the ordinary family was going to gain, and how much better socially it was that the position should be as we were suggesting at that time&mdash;all the time, of course, making it clear that there was no question of continuing them for an indefinite period&mdash;and because I happened to take the example of £2 10s. a week, or some figure like that, we had some of the gentlemen on the opposite benches putting an advertisement in the papers saying that was the wage which I thought right for agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was said, because I happened to take that example in order to show how the figures would work out, to show what a family was going to get through the subsidies and what it was going to lose in the ordinary way through taxation.  There was then no <Col N="513" /> enthusiasm about subsidies, none whatever, on the part of the Labour Party. They denounced us from one end of the country to the other because we had to provide for them by taxation on beer, spirits and tobacco.</P>
    <P>Again, in 1952, we had to deal with the situation in which we had the huge deficit of £15,000,000 in our current accounts.  When we looked over the projected expenditure and the projected revenue, we had to ask ourselves, how are we going to fill this gap of £15,000,000?  Are we going to keep the subsidies and put on £15,000,000 on taxation to meet them, or are we going to lighten the burden of taxation, as we had increased it when we put the subsidies on first, by reducing the subsidies.  We felt that, as far as the community as a whole was concerned, the community interest would best be served by reducing the subsidies, and by that means reducing the amount that would otherwise have to be obtained, through taxation.</P>
    <P>When we asked the Opposition what were they going to do about this, they did a very clever thing.  They stuck their heads in the sands and did not see it, like the fellow who looked at the giraffe and said: &ldquo;I do not believe it.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;There is no difficulty, you are looking for a surplus of £10,000,000; that is what you are after.&rdquo;  We asked them to give us some figures and some details and to point out where the supposed excessive revenue was to be got.  The figures they gave were ridiculous and they proved to be ridiculous.  But that did not stop them from repeating them here in the House for a year.  When the year's accounts were closed, instead of having a surplus of £10,000,000, there was a deficit of £2,000,000.  Did that matter to the Opposition?  Not a bit of it.</P>
    <P>They were not concerned with balancing Budgets, and they took mighty good care not to balance their own when there was an election in sight.  Their attitude towards that particular difficulty was, &ldquo;Oh, we will accept an increase in the rates of remuneration for civil servants, guards and the Army, of £3,500,000 and make <Col N="514" /> no provision for it: we will wait until after the election and see what will happen.&rdquo;  When we took over, there was a deficit of something between £6,000,000 and £7,0000,000 for current expenditure that could have been foreseen with any reasonable degree of approximation.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we could not act in that irresponsible fashion.  We had to balance our accounts, and, therefore, the choice was either to leave on the subsidies and add on the extra amount of taxation to meet them or reduce our expenditure by reducing the subsidies.  We proceeded in the latter way.  We have not to be thought by the Labour Party or anybody else to think of the individuals in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We were talking about capital development and increasing our industrial production when some of the people opposite were talking like the Deputy.  We knew perfectly well that bread is the most common of all foodstuffs for the majority of the people.  When we reduced the subsidy we regretted having to do so, but one of the things that determined the actual amount taken off was the fact that flour, at the price at which it was being subsidised, was the cheapest feeding material available for animals, and that, if there was not rationing, it would be fed to animals almost in spite of you.  Because of the subsidised price at which it was being made available, it would be fed to animals.  We had rationing to prevent that to a large extent.  If we wanted to get rid of rationing, as we did, then there was a certain limit to the extent to which we could depress the price of flour and bread.  The determining line which we took finally was the line where we thought that flour would not be cheaper than other feeding materials for animals.  If Deputies look at the prices of some of the commodities they will find that is pretty near the line, and that if you were to do very much more in the way of reducing <Col N="515" /> it, there was the strong possibility that the flour would be misused.</P>
      <P>We knew that the price of bread was going to be a very serious matter for the ordinary household and the ordinary worker, and we tried, as best we could within our limits, to relieve the situation, and so we brought in some compensatory allowances to try and lighten the burden on those sections of the community that were being most hard hit by our proposals.  One hears nothing to-day from those on the benches who are attacking us about these compensatory allowances which we brought in and which amount to about £3,750,000 a year.  These were the compensatory allowances, increased old age pensions, increased unemployment assistance, and so on.  It requires £3,750,000 in taxation to meet these.  Were they worth while?  We believe they were.  We believe that relieving the old age pensioner, giving him these extra allowances to try to compensate for what he would have to pay, and increased children's allowances, and so on, for the larger families, were all worth while.  I would remind the Labour Party of that and I say to them or anybody else that I am not pleading for Labour Party support.  I am stating the policy which we have always stood for.  Members of the Labour Party know perfectly well that we are a Party of all sections&mdash; I would like to deal with that as a separate issue&mdash;and that we settle out these matters amongst ourselves.  We did get agreement from all sections of the community that it was worth while to do what we have done.  It was worth while to get £3,750,000 in taxation in order to make that burden lighter.  There is still £5,500,000 a year that has to be raised by taxation in order to meet the bread and flour subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not let anybody then pretend in this House that this Government has completely cut out subsidies.  We have not.  We have cut them out to the extent that we thought was possible and as far as possible because we felt that, in general, having to put on taxation to meet these could only be justified in exceptional circumstances, that it was not good generally for the ordinary <Col N="516" /> economy of the country, that it was very often taking out of every pocket in the country a certain amount and putting that on the table of every household; in that way a certain sum was lost in administration, taking it out and putting it back.  That is the difficulty about social services.  If you are not careful, you waste a good deal of the money in administration costs.</P>
    <P>In the Budget this year provision is made for the poorer sections of the community in order to make the cost of living press less heavily on them. There is some £9,000,000 and if that £9,000,000 were not there, there would be £9,000,000 less taxation to be raised.  But you cannot have it both ways.  The Labour Party did not want subsidies or taxation at one period. Now they do not want to get rid of subsidies and taxation.  What they want is to get rid of taxation and to have the subsidies.  You simply cannot have it that way unless you go and borrow for it.  Is it the policy of the Labour Party that we should go and borrow for our daily bread?  Surely it ought to be the purpose of the community to try to make ends meet and to try to secure by the product of our labour and our industry the means which will enable us to get the things which we require in order to live.  They will admit that if we want to continue in our work it is essential that we balance revenue with expenditure. When there is taxation that taxation does hit the poor and the rich.  Heavy taxation has this terrible advantage that it helps to depress industry and puts a certain stop to enterprise and activity.  I have never believed in the full socialist creed.  I want to say that quite openly.  I believe in private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy not talk about that.  Although I believe in private enterprise, I do not believe in the law of the jungle and never <Col N="517" /> have.  I do not believe in unrestricted competition.  I do not believe that Almighty God created every one of us with the same ability to maintain ourselves. Therefore, it is good and right for the community as a whole to come in and help the weaker sections of the community and enable them to lead as full lives as the Almighty has given them the capacity of living.</P>
      <P>We have acted on that principle all the time.  We have been trying to keep a middle course which we believe is the right course, that is, to encourage private enterprise by every means in our power.  There are certain enterprises which ought to be undertaken for the good of the community. These enterprises very often may not be of the kind which will attract private individuals, the private <i>entrepreneur.</i> Therefore, if we want them, the State must intervene.  The State has a duty to protect private enterprise in certain respects but the State must intervene in cases where private enterprise is not forthcoming.  As everybody knows, we have done that to develop the resources of the country.  I ask the Labour Party: are they against that? Are they against, for instance, the development that we began in Rineanna?  They joined up with the man who hoped and prayed he would see rabbits running over it and that the radio communication poles would be used as knitting needles.  It has always appeared to me to be a very strange alliance, but, as I have said, the Labour Party have a perfect right to do anything they choose.</P>
      <P>We have always stood for the development to the full of the natural resources of the country.  We have always stood for the development to the full of the credit and financial resources of the country in so far as they were required for the progress of the nation.  We have not hesitated from the beginning in the development of the activities of the E.S.B.  We never hesitated to ensure they got the capital to enable them to carry on with their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not hesitated to develop the resources of the bogs so that electric power would be available and domestic <Col N="518" /> fuel if it were badly needed.  We have not nesitated to use the raw materials that could be got from our farms to have been manufactured into sugar, thus providing a certain cash crop, not one that would go up and down with the world market but one that could be fostered in the domestic circumstances and give valuable employment and the means of earning a living to many people.  I think there are about 3,000 workers employed at the peak period.  As a result of good management we have people who are interested not merely in the narrow industry of the production of sugar but they are interested in the people who provide the raw commodity, not merely in the cash crop but in their whole welfare.  That is one of the advantages we get from enterprises of that kind.</P>
    <P>Another direction in which we have made progress is in the exploration of our mines.  These things did not happen to-day or yesterday.  When we came in first, one of the things I had dreamed of&mdash;it turned out to be an empty dream &mdash;was that Leitrim might be a possible industrial centre in the country.  I thought in the old days we would have coal and iron there.  There was an investigation and exploration to see what minerals we had in this country that could, be developed in the national interest and we were prepared, wherever they were likely to be found, to give the necessary capital in order to have them explored and developed but also to protect the commodities which were produced if that protection should seem to be necessary in the interests of their proper working. There has never been any policy or any suggestion of contraction of capital or a denial of capital for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The only reservation we ever made was the same reservation as I made the other evening when speaking here, that is, that our resources are limited and we have to be careful that it is not a question of a feast and a famine with us and that these resources be conserved so that, when they are used, they will provide other resources that will remain in substitution for the resources we are using.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> As long as any of our assets of any kind, internal or external, are being used in a manner which will provide resources equivalent to those which we have been using up, we should be always happy to use them but we do not think that these resources ought to be used up in ordinary everyday consumption.  For instance, we do not think that it is good that the £62,000,000 or so of our reserves was used up in the way it was in fact used up in the year 1951.  There was an increase in the deficit from £30,000,000 in 1950 to £60,000,000 in 1951.  Of that increase of £30,000,000, not one-half of it could be attributed to capital formation. The other half was used for things that we consumed at the time, and when they were used they were as much gone and departed from us as the breakfast we ate three weeks ago.  If it was necessary to eat our breakfast, all right, but surely it had not come to that.  A lot of the things that were brought into the country in that rush and that were paid for with valuable dollars and Marshall Aid were things that were not necessary for the welfare of this community.  Some of them were in the nature of luxuries. Others were in the nature of things we should have produced here ourselves.</P>

The Government had a terrible responsibility in the country, both for internal conditions and for our external position.  There were hardships imposed.  There had to be because of world conditions.  We had to put hardships upon our people and the Labour Party did not come along and take with us the knocks that we had to stand in that period. They have a perfect right.  They were not a part of the Government and <Col N="521" /> they did not have anything to do with the policy adopted.  I am not questioning the right of Labour to do it.  What I do question and say is untrue is that there is any evidence that we have changed our policy or become more Tory, progressively or otherwise, either suddenly or progressively.  I am not conscious, and I do not think it is happening either without my seeing it myself or being sharply reminded of it, that I have become more of a Tory to-day than when I first came into politics.</P>

Those people who talk about increasing sterling assets did not mind increasing them to the extent of £37,000,000 to put funds into the Central Bank.

      <P>Well, I think I would look better dressed up as a Tory than the Deputy with a Republican flag around him.</P>
      <P>I was saying that the trouble about capital expenditure is this, that you have the debt charges going up.  The debt charges even on the Marshall Aid money will be £1.2 million this year. We must provide that in taxation that has to go on to some article or income-tax or something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the way, lest I forget it, as I was talking about alleviation of taxation we were told about the position of income-tax payers by somebody on the other side, but those people would not add that 170,000 of the income-tax payers have had less to pay after our Budget of 1952 than they would have to pay even though the rate of taxation was increased.  We have to provide £1.2 million to meet this year's charges on Marshall Aid money.  In a few years' time the sum will have gone up by £250 000 more and even after a period it will have run up by another £500,000.  This year as I have said £11.9 million will be the amount that will have to be provided to meet the gross debt charges which we will have to meet from taxation. Now we are never afraid of that provided that the capital enterprise is productive. We have, as I said when I was opening at the beginning of the debate, to be a little careful that we <Col N="524" /> do not overstrain ourselves and that what I may call amenity investment should not bear an undue proportion to the amount of money that is put into capital productive purposes.  I do not know what the Labour view about this is.  I do not know what the extreme socialist view is, but I do know our view anyhow, and we believe that we are only keeping to the middle of the road, the road that we can continue travelling along for a long distance, and that we are trying to balance our expenditure so that as much as possible of it will be productive and that afterwards as much as the community can afford will be used for social and amenity purposes. That is as far as capital policy is concerned, and I do not think that any member of the Labour Party has any fault to find with that.  They may say that we are going a little too slow or something else but in principle where do they differ from us?  I do not see how they can.  I have often been asked by foreigners about our policy. I have often been asked by people interested in political organisations in different countries and social organisations: &ldquo;What is your policy?&rdquo; and so on; and in general the people who come from the Continent and other countries say: &ldquo;Are you not a Labour Party?&rdquo; I say: &ldquo;No.  We represent the broad general sections of the community, we have all sorts of people in our organisation and we have all agreed that this is the national and social policy that we stand for.&rdquo; I would rather a thousand times be pitched out of this seat than go back on that because I believe in it, and if I am going to be pitched out of office I do not mind in the slightest although I do not want to be pitched out through exaggeration and falsehood.  When I speak of myself, that is the attitude of every member of our Government as far as I know and of our Party.  It is a very good thing for the country that when principles are considered the objections to them are considered also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane talks about an increase in taxation.  We have got to be very watchful about it, and as I have said heavy taxation can have disadvantages, but we cannot have it both <Col N="525" /> ways any more than in the case of the subsidies.  When a piece of legislation comes into this House we ought to consider not merely the benefits that are going to be given but also the disadvantages in the way of burdens of various kinds that may be put on the rest of the community.  If we are helping the unemployed, as I think we have a right and duty to do from community resources, we must remember that every person who is employed is participating in that helping and that we have to be careful that some of those who are contributing to that are not burdened beyond what is fair to them.  We have got to consider the distance which we can go, and in talking about old age pensions I would like to think that more old age pensions were possibly available.</P>

I would not say it was charity.  I would say it was justice.  I never could understand the Labour Party, when they were talking about people who got assistance such as unemployment assistance, suggesting that it was something like charity.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, it is my fundamental belief that man is not meant to live alone, that he is in society and that it is a function of society to aid the individual to reach the highest level that he is capable of, and that, when I am a member of a society and when I do my duty to that society, in fair play society ought to do its duty by doing its best to help me.  That is my philosophy about the relations between the individual and society.  My belief is that when we pay taxes into the central fund of the community, and pay them voluntarily if we wish to remain in the community, we should be regarded as, in a sense, insuring ourselves against disasters which we cannot avert but which the community can help us to overcome.  These amounts have to be got by the contributions of every section of the community and they contribute by way of taxes.  The only problem is to see that we do not go too far and burden those who happen to be producers, to such an extent that they are no longer able to produce and give the employment they were giving.  In the long run, that would do more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only consideration we have had in mind in considering how capital investment is to be used.  I do not think that our Government differs there from the fundamental policy of the Labour Party, as I have in the past understood it, or that we differ from any decent member of the community. Therefore, we can have our differences here.  Some may say: <Col N="527" />&ldquo;You are going a little too far&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You are not going far enough&rdquo;; but for goodness' sake let us have some agreement on the fundamental principles. I am trying to show the principles which have energised any actions we have taken as a Government in social or economic life.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about capital investment. Let me come now to our day-to-day expenses.  I say to the Labour Party&mdash;I am speaking to the Labour Party generally&mdash;they must make up their own minds on their own views.  I am not bidding, nor do I wish to did, in any way for their support, but I wish to bid for understanding. I do not want to have our Government labelled as something we are not.  With regard to current expenditure, we have to provide the means by taxation.  If we increase benefits, we have to find the taxation. The Labour Party often think that there is a tremendous amount that can be got by income-tax.  A considerable sum is being got at the moment, about £21,000,000, I think, from income-tax generally.  I would like the Labour Party to remember that that will not meet our needs.  Our needs have gone up to £100,000,000.  Are you going to double income-tax, or even increase it? If you do, you will kill the initiative which is the driving force in industry. You cannot do it.  You will not have employment in industry, if you go along in that way.  I think even the Labour Party will give me credit for having supported all the time the various social measures that have been taken here.  I may not have initiated them, but I have supported them and believed in them.  It will be found that the expenditure in social services is fairly high.  The question is how much higher can we go without creating that very unemployment which is our principal problem to-day?</P>
    <P>The cost of living has gone up in almost every country with which our cost of living has been compared.  I think there were 17 of the O.E.E.C. nations compared, and in 14 of the 17 the cost of living has gone up.  We are included in the 17.  In 14 cases it had <Col N="528" /> gone up; in only two cases has it gone down, and that very slightly, by I per cent.; and in another one it is unchanged. Surely the policy of Fianna Fáil did not create that, in all those countries.  It is one of those universal things that happen, for which we may be blamed.  Blame us if you will, that we did not take sufficient counteracting measures&mdash;I will argue that out as to what measures were open to us&mdash;but do not blame us for increasing the cost of living by 26 points.  By having avoided taxation we have added seven points, or by doing away with the subsidies we have put on seven points; but we got no credit whatever for the compensatory allowances, which will cost this year £3,750,000.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of unemployment. I think I have been speaking on public platforms now for 37 years, speaking on Irish issues, economic and national, and I do not believe that if you go back over all those speeches you will find many in which I have not dealt with the two questions, emigration and employment. These are two questions on which I have spoken all the time.  We were longing to get into office in 1932 in order to tackle these questions.  We tackled them in industry by giving employment. As a result, as far as industrial employment is concerned, I think 110,000 were in employment in 1931 and last year or the year before there were 220,000, just double the number.</P>
    <P>We set out to try to meet this problem by private industrial employment. It was the most direct and immediate way to achieve our aim of making us as self-sufficient as possible, of saving ourselves by putting ourselves in a position of strength in a time of crisis and also giving employment.  There is room for development and there is development going on.  I do not know if the Tánaiste has already told you that over 152 new projects have gone into actual production during the period since we came into office.  You may say that the numbers of unemployed have not sufficiently diminished.  I would say that if you had not these projects we would have still greater unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> It is bad enough, I am prepared to admit.  I do not take Deputy Lehane's view at all.  There is a problem which we have to attend to as an immediate and urgent problem, but we have always had this difficulty of employment because we are not sufficiently industrialised on the one hand and we are not getting sufficient agricultural produce from our land on the other hand.  Whilst I would have an eye on the employment given in getting that production, I would believe in getting it by the most up-to-date methods in agriculture.  I believe that, in the long run, if we have production we will have something to consume, but if we have not production we will not have the wherewith to consume.  Therefore, I believe in getting after agriculture to see what extra production and employment it can give.  We are a small island and our resources are limited and we have a really difficult problem in finding employment for our people.</P>
    <P>What was the result of our efforts in the years before the war?  I think those efforts were reasonably satisfactory. There was a tremendous increase in industrial employment.  We cut down emigration to a considerable extent, nearly one-third of what it was. Deputies on the Opposition Benches, including Labour, were shouting in 1947 that people were flying from the land as they had never gone since the days of Black '47.  My view was that that was not true, but we had no figures at the time to prove it.  It is the same as the Deputies yonder shouting and saying the people of Ireland have turned us down.  They want to interpret the by-elections in their particular way.  As there are no figures to prove the contrary, everyone can shout as he likes.  When the figures came to be known, when the most reliable figures we could get were published, they showed that in the year 1947, when we were being attacked by Labour for our neglect of this particular problem, the truth was, as proved afterwards, that in September of that year the lowest number since 1932 or 1933 was registered.  The lowest on the register was for September 6th, under 35,000 unemployed.  That has never been reached since, in any week.</P>

That was the time when Deputies, particularly our friends on the Fine Gael Benches, were shouting that the young people were being exported like cattle. I said that one of our aims from the beginning had been to try to find employment because we believed that unemployment was the real cause of emigration.  We did not set up a commission to determine what was causing emigration.</P>

      <P>If that is right, well and good.  The fact is, however, that we tried from the beginning to deal with emigration by providing employment and to deal with unemployment by capital expenditure on housing and other constructive works which gave employment.  Then there was the question of public works.  The position in later years was not the position we had back in 1932.  There was a good deal of industrial activity and activity in housing from the time we started with the big housing drive, which I think you will admit enabled the next Government to proceed with it.  That was one of the things for which they can claim credit.  They did not fall back on it.  We left them certain plans for housing, certain sites were prepared, and the late Deputy Murphy did good work in that Department.  All credit to him for doing it.  We did not slacken off either.  We had the biggest annual housing output back in the year 1938/39, just before the war, when <Col N="532" /> there were 17,000 houses built or reconstructed. Last year we had the next biggest, and the year before that the next biggest again.  As far as these years are concerned, it cannot be suggested that we held up or slackened off with housing, or that the Minister who succeeded the previous Minister did.  That was one creditable thing which the Coalition did.  We did not slacken off in that.</P>
      <P>Apparently some diminution has taken place this year, which has given us a considerable amount of anxiety both as far as Dublin is concerned and as far as the local authorities are concerned. The point is, are we to go into every local council and corporation and do their planning for them? I think it is quite sufficient if on our part we give them the necessary help, if they tell us what they wish done, if we say we will be behind them, make the necessary funds available and let them go on with work.</P>
      <P>I remember getting the City Manager in some years ago and urging him, in order to give employment, to develop sites and to get the foundation of houses laid down as far as he could as, with the coming in of material, that would give us a flying start.  What is happening now was referred to as a very serious matter.  The housing industry is one of our big industries employing large numbers of people in profitable employment.  It is a serious thing to find, as far as the local authorities are concerned, that we are coming to the point when the housing needs are actually being met.  There was a survey made in 1947.  There was an examination carried out in connection with 45 local authorities which shows that the work they have at present on hands when completed will meet the requirements of 1947.  A new survey should be made in these places to see if in fact any requirements still have to be provided, but we will have a problem there the moment that the programme is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in Dublin I am told there is some holding up of private building. We all know what happened in connection with private building.  Some years ago when there was a rush on houses, prices sky-rocketed.  Those <Col N="533" /> who bought the houses at inflacted prices were buying property which would deteriorate.  There has been a slackening off in demand apparently.  I do not know what is the precise cause.</P>

      <P>I intend to go as fully into it as I can.  To suggest that we are simply acting as account keepers and that the welfare of the people is far away from our minds is not true.  I do not believe in that way of acting.  A person who wants to get a general picture of his business has to see how it is going.  If he wants to see the business properly conducted, he must see it in actual operation.  If we want to get a proper picture in connection with housing we have to go to the people who are responsible for private building, get some representative group, see what their difficulties are and see if there is any way in which we can help.  It is said that we are responsible for the high price of money.  We are not responsible for it.</P>

      <P>Did not Deputy Dillon add the £37,000,000 and the £7,000,000 that was added to the sterling assets?  The Deputy would not stand cross-examination for five minutes on that.  It is very splendid and easy for him to have it both ways, to vote for increased social services and then come out and say that taxation is too high. You can do both&mdash;that is one of the privileges of the Opposition.  I say, as far as we are concerned that the increase in the bank rate was caused by the increase in the bank rate in Britain.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that about 80 per cent. of our exports go to Britain and that we are paid in sterling for them.  It is with that sterling we have to buy in the dollar area and other markets.  It is rather unfortunate that 80 per cent. of our money is coming from goods which go over there for sterling.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputies put down specific motions on any question of finance and we are quite prepared to meet them.  But they prefer to talk in this wild way which is quite unrelated to the facts.  You will hear it said that the Central Bank is lending money at ¼ or ½ per cent. or whatever short-term rate they get on money held to have it on the spot when needed.  None of us like that, but a certain proportion of money has to be kept in an immediately available form and if you have Irish securities, you have a limited market for them and you know that you cannot realise them quickly.  The Minister for Finance had to get some £15,000,000 realised a short time ago, since we came into office.  If that money was drawn out of the Irish market we would have had quite a crisis.  He had to have it where it was possible to turn it into cash rapidly. We are not attached to any ideas of any association of that sort at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the hard facts of our commerce that put us in that position, and I have always regretted that so much of our trade has been with one country, that there was not more diversity, and everything we can do as a Government we are doing, but we have to bear in mind the good of the people who are sending out goods and we must not lightly sacrifice their interest for the mere sake of diversification, which would probably be better for the nation as a whole.  We are deeply concerned about this problem which has been a concern of ours at all times. We believe in the long-term solution which is to try and get more agricultural produce, to get industry going and to develop our services to the utmost, but I do admit we have an increase <Col N="535" /> in unemployment.  That has been exaggerated.  I do not want to argue it, because even if it was much smaller it would be serious.  I am not going to argue on numbers, but I do say that the facts are not quite as they have been presented.  It is now as it has always been, and I have felt myself that we have not been able to deal with that problem as we should like to deal with it.  I looked at the money that is available for building hospitals and schools and so on and it is a very substantial sum.  But it has not yet apparently taken up the slack in those unemployed in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I have been talking to some members of the city corporation about housing schemes which I am having examined to see if they can give useful employment, but I am not a genius like Deputy Morrissey evidently was. Deputy Morrissey said on one occasion &mdash;I think it was in April, 1947, and I think I remember the reference too; it was Volume 105, column 847.  If he looks that up he will find where he said, at one point there, that every able-bodied man and woman willing to work could be put into useful work to-morrow morning.  He did not do that when he was in office because he simply wanted to make the statement which was very fine in a speech, but which showed a complete lack of appreciation of the problem.  That was in the debate on the Department of Industry and Commerce and he happened by fate to become Minister for Industry and Commerce himself and he did not solve it in a day.  When he was down the country and was being attacked about that statement he made, he said that if the people were prepared to work half as hard here as they were prepared to work elsewhere there would be a job for everybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> I do not think he will seriously contend that that was any more than a gag thrown across the House.  It is a serious problem and I am prepared to work with the Labour Party or Fine Gael or anybody who can provide the detailed solution for it.  For the moment we are trying to do it by getting an examination of the situation and seeing what necessary public utility works can be started in which those who are in the building industry can be employed, pending the time when they can be employed otherwise.</P>
    <P>There are some on the register not capable of working and it might clear our minds if we could arrive at that number.  But there are people who are willing to work and I can see myself in imagination in the home of one of those men asking themselves what they are going to do, whether they are going to emigrate, or get work here in their own land.  That is an appeal which I certainly will listen to, if I can and in every way as a Government if we can help that appeal, we will do it.  If anybody can help in the matter, we will co-operate with them, and the money will be found.</P>
