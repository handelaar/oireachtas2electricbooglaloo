    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware of the serious increase in the number of unemployed in Dublin during the past two years and the consequent sufferings inflicted on the families of unemployed workers; and, if so, if he will make a statement as to what positive steps the Government propose to take to deal with the grave unemployment situation in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question in this House on the 21st of last month.</P>
      <P>All I think I need add to that reply is that, since then, the number of persons on the live register of unemployed at the Dublin employment exchanges has shown a progressive downward tendency in each of the past three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that over the past two years there has been a very considerable increase in the number of persons on the live register of unemployed in Dublin?  At its peak a 50 per cent. increase was reached.  While there has been some falling off in recent weeks, the increase is still very significant, particularly amongst the building trade workers and those in factory employment. Surely the Government has something in mind.  They ought to provide work through the medium of the local authorities or take general <Col N="738" /> steps that will help to relieve unemployment. The position is definitely bad in Dublin and the normal falling off in the figures which takes place at this time of the year is not going to relieve that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government and the Dublin Corporation have been taking measures and making provision so that greater employment will be given. That was indicated in the reply on the last occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no doubt that the Dublin Corporation and the Minister for Local Government are considering the matter, it is well known that there are many schemes that could be put in hands very quickly in regard to corporation and other forms of employment.  The situation is so serious that it requires more than normal methods to deal with it. I feel that every effort should be made by the Government to relieve the situation by putting these schemes in hands immediately.</P>

      <P>The reply given on the previous occasion indicated that money from the Exchequer was being provided to a far greater extent than last year, just for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that a statement has appeared in an English newspaper recently that the body of the late Roger Casement was not destroyed after his execution in Pentonville Jail in 1916; that the normal system of destruction of bodies at that time was not carried out in Casement's case and that his remains are in a preserved state; and, if so, if he will have the necessary inquiries made from the British Home Office with a view to having that statement either confirmed or contradicted; and, further, if he will make representations to have Casement's body repatriated to Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the newspaper statement to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> According to information furnished by the British authorities there was no difference, so far as they know, between the treatment of Roger Casement's body and that of anyone else buried as their law requires within the walls of a prison.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's question of February last, there has been no indication of a change of attitude on the part of the British authorities on the subject of the repatriation of Casement's remains. I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by making a formal approach in the matter at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the requirements of the law in the matter.  Is the Minister quite certain that there are any legal requirements in regard to matters of that kind?  I do not think so.  If that answer is given to him, possibly he might draw to the attention of the British Government the fact that there are no such requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Our information is that there was a routine way of dealing with bodies buried within prison walls until 1926 and that, after that, it changed.</P>

I draw your attention, Sir, to amendment No. 30 on the final paper which is apparently a substitute for amendment No. 24 on the earlier paper.  That amendment has undergone a change and I have always understood that, if an amendment is tabled a second time, it is reproduced in the form in which it first appeared and that, if there is to be any amendment of it, it should appear as an amendment.</P>

As the amendment previously appeared&mdash;they are both amendments to insert sections before Section 18&mdash;it referred to pupils attending day classes in a school in a functional area which provides elementary, secondary or vocational education.  The later amendment leaves out secondary and vocational education.  Has the first amendment been withdrawn and is this a substitute for it?</P>

      <P>Following such discussions as went on between the reinforced Health Council and the Minister, we have seen that the representative association of the medical body is still fundamentally opposed to the general principles upon which this Bill is framed and the foundational approach to the organisation of the <Col N="756" /> health services referred to in this Bill. The Minister will recall that we asked that this Bill would be referred to a Special Committee of the Dáil and Seanad with powers to send for persons, papers and documents so that, in view of the conflict that had arisen in so many different spheres with regard to the provisions of this Bill, the actual details of the Bill might be examined in the light of experienced opinion by those who are interested in the matter from various points of view and by those who would have to carry it out.  The Minister has declined to meet the wishes of that section of the House that wanted such a body set up.  Since the Minister declined that he has had a statement of the attitude of the medical profession in the matter and the result of his subsequent discussions with the reinforced Health Council has been simply a reiteration by the medical body that it is so averse to the general lines of these proposals that it is not prepared to work them.</P>
      <P>Surely in an atmosphere of that particular kind and when the Minister is insisting on going through with the discussion here on the Committee Stage, he should at least do his best to help us in the matter.  It is hardly propitious that on the second section of this Bill he would not tell us frankly that in his mind the county manager is the local authority for the purpose of letting him know on what particular date or in what particular order the proposals in this Bill will be put into force.  I submit that the House is entitled to hear from the Minister, first and foremost, an outline of his view of the structure of this Bill which would dictate that it would come into force in a certain sequence and that if the Minister is going to have consultation with the local authorities on that point, he would let us know what form that consultation is going to take.</P>

      <P>I do expect an answer and it is treating the House very badly if the House does not get <Col N="757" /> an answer.  The Minister is forcing the Bill through this House in a very extraordinary way and his opening note on the matter is that although he asks us to accept a section of this Bill that empowers him to take provisions of this Bill and put them into operation on different dates, he still declines to give any picture to the House as to what he has in mind with regard to the build-up of this Bill that would suggest that it would be normal to introduce it by degrees.  We do require that picture and when the Minister speaks of his association with the local authority, we do require information as to whether it is going to be discussed with the elected representatives of the local authorities or whether, when he speaks of the local authority in connection with Section 2, he is only speaking of the county manager.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it could be answered or not.  The county councils are the controlling authorities so far as this Bill is concerned but they can, as they sometimes do, authorise the county managers to act for them.  The county councils are the bodies who will exercise authority under the Bill.  Every single county council that met under this Bill has shown that they understand that.  The Deputy need not try to get away with this suggestion that it is the county managers.  As a matter of fact, the Deputy himself was the first person to introduce this business of the county manager.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the whole Bill hinges on this section. The section says that certain portions of the Bill are to come into operation on a date to be decided.  The final arbiter in deciding that question must be the Minister.  The Minister is not going to decide that question on his own.  He is going to be advised by somebody and the question is by whom?  I think it is perfectly reasonable on the part of Deputy Mulcahy to inquire who is actually going to advise the Minister.  The Minister has replied to a certain extent but I am still at a loss to know whether it is the county council or the county manager. Is each particular local authority to be in a position to decide when they will operate a particular section of the Act or is it to be a uniform business to be dished up to the Minister by all the local authorities?  I think the Minister should make a statement on this section because the whole Bill hinges on it.  So far, he has given us no information whatever.  It is a simple matter. The Minister should give us a short statement as to how he proposes to work the Bill because the whole Bill hinges on Section 2 so far as I read it.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the measure, I believe the Minister did state his intentions in relation to the Bill and as to when the various parts of the Bill would be brought into operation.

      <P>I took that at the time as a statement of the Minister's policy in regard to the measure.  I took it as a statement of policy having regard to what we had known had already taken place shortly before the Second Reading of the Bill, that local authorities said they would not operate the Bill because it was too costly.  I drew the deduction from the Minister's statement that local authorities which took the view: &ldquo;We will not operate the Bill because of the expense entailed on the ratepayers,&rdquo; would not be forced to bring the measure into operation. There were so many local authorities who took that stand that I came to the conclusion that this Bill was never going to come into operation.</P>

      <P>I should not like to agree that that is a correct interpretation of what exactly the local authorities said.

Most local authorities have said that they will not bring the Bill into operation as long as the rates are called upon to pay the greater portion of the expense or even half the expense, so that this Bill will never come into operation so far as they are concerned.</P>

      <P>Are we not getting a good deal of unnecessary sparring across the House in regard to this matter?  It seems to me that the Bill is quite clear.  After the Bill has been passed certain statutory obligations will be imposed upon the Minister. He is given power under this section to make Orders as to when particular sections of the Bill will come into operation.  Quite clearly he will consult the local authorities in regard to that matter.  There will be varying expressions of opinion on the part of local authorities in regard to bringing certain parts of the Bill into operation and the raising of the necessary finances to defray the cost.  At the same time the Minister must make a decision and it is the Minister, not the local authority, who will make that decision.  If any particular local authority is not prepared to operate that part of the Bill, then the Minister has power to compel the local authority to do so.  If the Minister reads through the provisions of the Bill he will find many sections which show clearly that once the Minister makes an Order, the health authority will have to comply with it, or we will have another health authority and the local council will be abolished.</P>

      <P>Possibly I am misunderstanding the purpose of Section 2 altogether, but I understood Section 2 to be just the ordinary type of section enabling the Minister to bring different parts of the Act into operation on different dates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading it closely it appears to be quite different from the usual section which merely provides for the bringing into operation universally of an Act or portion of an Act.  Am I to take it from what the Minister has said that he construes the section as enabling him to bring a portion of it into operation in regard to one particular county but not in regard to another county?  I am merely seeking information at the moment.  From something the Minister said in the course of this discussion I now have the impression that the Minister visualises utilising that section in order to enable him to bring into operation the Act, in whole or in part, and to apply it in regard to one particular local authority but not in regard to another particular local authority.  I put it this way: the Minister might decide to bring in Part I&mdash;I am just taking Part I at random&mdash;and apply it to the City of Dublin but not apply it to the City of Cork.  I am not now trying to raise difficulties.  I am merely trying to elucidate the position.  The section is phrased differently from the usual sections.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, health regulations are passed which, I am sure, operate on much the same legal formula.  Let us assume that a dental scheme is brought into operation for the whole country; one county may not adopt that scheme as promptly as another.  The same <Col N="764" /> position may obtain here.  Within reason, that will be permitted but if one county lags behind too long force will have to be used to make that particular county adopt the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I can take it that the Minister construes the section as enabling him to exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Not to bring the Act into operation in relation to particular local authorities, for whatever reason he may have.  It may be a good reason or it may be a bad reason, but the Minister visualises he has that power under that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If a regulation is made enabling local authorities to bring a certain service into operation, some local authorities will probably adopt that regulation promptly; others will not.  Enforcing the regulation, however, may not come for some time after the regulation is made.</P>

May I put the question as simply as I can: is it the Minister's view that this Section 2 will enable him to bring into operation some part of the Act in relation to Cork, for instance, but not in relation to Carlow, because, if he thinks that is in the section, I want to tell him that it is certainly not specifically in it?</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I have already stated three times that an Order will be made enabling the local authority to bring in a certain service.

      <P>I am not trying to create difficulties.  Deputy Larkin has pointed out that there are many mandatory provisions in the Bill.  Such provisions are not permissive.  In relation to these particular mandatory sections, unless the Minister takes powers to exclude the local authority in a given area he has no discretion whatsoever in the matter.  Once that particular part of the Act comes into operation it will be mandatory on all local authorities to provide the services proposed.  I merely raise this matter so that the Minister will have an opportunity of considering whether or not that is what he wants to do.  I can visualise certain difficulties.  Quite apart from the question as to whether or not a local authority is in favour of the Bill or has the necessary funds to implement the cost of the regulation, I can visualise circumstances in which it might be undesirable to force a local authority to provide a particular service at a particular time.  For instance, in connection with maternity services, many local authorities would not have the necessary beds available, and so on.  I do not think the Minister has considered that.</P>

      <P>This piece of legislation is divided into five parts.  We can neglect the first part which is preliminary and general.  The other four parts are substantial. We have had different types of legislation brought into the Dáil in which there appeared something like Section 2.  On those occasions, the Minister in charge was always able to give at least a general indication that some time would be required to bring in part of the legislation, and that that would mean a delay.  He was also able to tell us what could be brought in almost immediately. Surely, the Minister could distinguish between the four parts of this Bill, and tell us what are the ones that will require the great deal of time, the ones that will require some time, but not too much, and the ones that can be brought in with some speed.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has been getting back to the first question that was asked.  The Minister has thought fit to charge me, particularly, with obstruction.  I am opposed to this Bill because of the general foundations of it and, generally, because of the spirit in which it has been brought in. The medical profession are not in agreement with the Minister on the matter.  I admit quite frankly that I am opposed to this measure.  My purpose here is to try and help the House to see what is happening.  I am trying to do that in the clearest and most effective way possible.  I originally asked the Minister, in relation to this section, if he could give us the picture that he has in his mind of this Bill and of its general structure so as to indicate to us the sequences that he has in his mind as to when the different sections of it will require to be put into operation.  I do not think that was an obstructive question.  I asked him, for example, if the local authority mentioned by him is to be the county manager.  I do not think that was a particularly obstructive question, except that the Minister wants to hide the confusion he speaks of by calling proper and orderly parliamentary inquiries in committee an obstructive process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if the Minister had addressed himself to answering the questions which I put to him in a reasonable way we might not have got into the confusion that he afterwards complained of.  We might, perhaps, have been deprived of the rather interesting insight into the situation which we have got and which no doubt we will come across again.  The Minister has got no nearer to answering my general question.  Are we to take it from what the Minister has said that Section 2 means that when he brings the Bill into operation on a particular date he will bring it into operation in respect of the whole State?  Will he indicate that when he brings part of the Bill into operation there will be arrangements made so <Col N="769" /> that local authorities may use their own discretion and come to their own conclusions as to whether they will bring that part into operation or not, or will the position be that if a sufficient number of them bring that part of the Bill into operation and take action in regard to it the Minister intends to make that section of the Bill compulsory in respect of those local authorities which have been hanging back?  What does the Minister mean when he says that he will not push local authorities unduly?  If a sufficient number of them come into line, does that mean that the others will be brought in compulsorily, or does the word &ldquo;unduly&rdquo; refer merely to time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy asked me what intentions I had with regard to bringing this into operation I said that I would have to consult the local authorities.  I think that any reasonable Deputy would have accepted that answer.  Instead of it being accepted we have had this long discussion.  I do not see why I should be accused of not being reasonable in my reply.  I think I gave a good and reasonable reply, namely, that I would have to consult the local authorities before I would know what services I would bring in, and when.  I do not intend to operate the Bill without consulting the local authorities.  I think that if a Minister on another Bill gave an answer such as I gave it would be accepted.  Why, then, should the Deputy find fault with my answer and accuse me of not giving sufficient information?  I do not know what the opinions of the local authorities may be on the different provisions of this Bill&mdash;on what should be brought in immediately and what should be delayed.  I intend, as I have said, to consult the local authorities.</P>

He is asked to indicate the dates on which various groups of provisions could be put into operation, whether there is any natural sequence or not, yet he can give no information.</P>
      <P>When he speaks of consulting local authorities, it is not unreasonable for us to ask what that consultation means. Is it consultation between himself or his Department and the county manager or is it the reference of a matter formally to the county council, that is, the body of elected representatives, for discussion at a meeting of the county council, in order to get a formal expression of opinion from the elected representatives? The Minister has not given any information on that point.  It is quite unreasonable for him not to answer as to the form in which the consultation will take place and I think it is the Minister who is being provocative rather than anyone else.</P>

      <P>It is a magnificent achievement to get something progressive once in a while from them. This is not the first Health Bill that has been before the House.  The 1947 <Col N="771" /> Health Act was passed with Section 3 as the counterpart of Section 2 in this Bill.  Much the same provisions were in it.  The health services have been carried on, to the knowledge of many members of Fine Gael who are members of local authorities, I suppose, with concurrence and agreement. These are exactly the same provisions, I imagine, unless the Minister has some intention of changing these general provisions since the 1947 Act was passed.  It is a bit late in the day for Deputy Mulcahy, with his hysterical concern for the rights of democratic government and of local authorities, to go into all sorts of play-acting, as he is doing on such a very serious matter as the Health Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the position more or less is that he does not know actually when he will be able to implement these different provisions as he has not had consultations with the local authorities. Had the Minister not a general consultation with the medical officers of health in the different counties?  Has he not already had consultation with the county managers?  Surely he must have some bird's-eye view of the position and must know when the different provisions can be introduced or when it would be possible for local authorities to implement them?  He ought to be able to give a general impression as to what sections it will be possible to introduce at the early stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole Bill hinges on this section. All we want to know is when approximately this Bill will be brought into effect by the different local authorities; what sections will be taken first; if certain counties are able to bring it in and others are not, what period will be allowed to them to put their house in order; and, as has already been asked, if it is compulsory on them? The Minister has said that if it passes the Dáil it is compulsory.  At the present moment it is the Minister's intention to bring this in compulsorily. In the event of the Bill being passed by the Oireachtas, what period will be allowed to local authorities to set their house in order and be ready to deal with the different provisions in the <Col N="772" /> Bill?  These are reasonable things to ask and as far as I know the Minister has not answered them yet.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan can answer that question himself. There are sections of the 1947 Act which were not brought into operation, so it is only reasonable that we would ask now what sections the Minister proposes to leave out and will not press unduly.  Surely that is a reasonable question.  He says he does not know. Maybe Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Cowan knows.  Apparently they do; they know what the Minister does not know himself.  We would be glad if they could enlighten us.  The 1947 Act was passed with such vehemence as we are to have, apparently, in this one being pushed through the House.  It had Sections 55, 67, 73 and 101 in it, that are fairly hairy, that even Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Cowan in their wildest dreams would not think of enforcing.  Discretion is to be used there.

      <P>I want to keep away from personalities and avoid being involved in quibbling.  Is it not possible for the Opposition to put their views clearly and for us all to do the same, so that we may get somewhere? My sympathy is with the Minister. When he says he may delay in implementing part of the Bill, for a very good reason, he is accused of neglecting to enforce the Bill altogether. When it is suggested that he will proceed to see that certain parts will be implemented as quickly as possible, in the interests of the people, he is told that he is pushing the Bill down the necks of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>What is wrong with that?  The Minister has said that the consultations he envisages before this Bill or portion of the Bill is brought into operation are consultations to ascertain when local authorities will be ready to operate the Bill. I would like to know from the Minister if that includes when they will be ready to foot the cost of the proposals in the Bill and what his attitude will be if they persist in their attitude: &ldquo;We will not agree to operate this Bill unless the general taxpayer pays as distinct from the ratepayer&rdquo;?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new line of Deputy Mulcahy's&mdash;is Deputy Dr. Browne expressing the Minister's mind; am I expressing the Minister's mind?  The Minister is expressing his own mind.  What we are endeavouring to do in this House, I hope, is to bring in a Health Bill that will work. I think we are all genuinely concerned in bringing in that type of Bill.  There are sections in this Bill on which there may be grounds for differences of opinion but, ofter 30 years of experience of this House, where, in every Act of consequence that has been passed, there has been a provision whereby sections of that Act will be brought in from time to time on ministerial Order and where we are following a precedent that has been mapped out over a period of 30 years, it does seem to me that the line adopted by Fine Gael on this Bill and on this particular section is to say: &ldquo;We are going to cause all the trouble we can. We are going to waste as much time as we can&rdquo;&mdash;on this, one of the most innocent and harmless sections in the Bill.  Because, if the Bill is to be brought into operation, it has to be brought into operation not the day it is passed but by Orders made by the Minister.  The Minister says &ldquo;I am going to adopt the sensible line.  I am going to consult all local authorities and, having consulted with them, I will bring in the different sections of the Bill or the different parts of the Bill as we are able to bring them in.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular discussion, I see one very important matter.  It is assumed, and it is a good thing to <Col N="776" /> have that assumption, by Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Dr. Esmonde and the other Deputies there, that there is no doubt at all about it that this Bill will be brought into operation part by part by the Minister in the next six months or the next year or two years or three years. That is what they are assuming now&mdash; in other words, that the Minister is going to bring it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>I look forward to being here when all these sections are brought in by the Minister.  The Bill says that these will be brought in from time to time by the Minister for Health.  Fine Gael, who are shouting about elections and change of Government and everything, can see nothing only the present Minister remaining in power until this Bill is brought finally into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I know the section does not say it, but the whole fear in the speeches is that the present Minister will be there during the period that this Bill will be brought into operation.  Deputy Dr. Browne has called this a filibuster.  It is.  It is ridiculous on this particular section. However, I am sure the plan has been worked out by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy MacEoin and Deputy McGilligan. They have worked out the plan to ask all these questions of the Minister, when he is going to bring in this section or that section or the other section.  Personally, I am delighted to see that confidence in the position of the Minister, that he will be there for the period of time that will be necessary to bring this Bill finally into operation.  That is the most important thing that results from the present discussion. I think Deputy Mulcahy might face that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure all concerned that I am facing the discussion of this measure for the purpose of bringing out the greatest possible <Col N="777" /> information about it.  In order to bring out the greatest possible information about this measure, it is necessary to carry on the discussions on the Committee Stage and further stages, on the Committee Stage at any rate, on the understanding that the person who will be operating this measure will be Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Health, and that the spirit in which he would be operating is the spirit in which it is conceived, going back to the 1947 Bill and the 1945 Bill.</P>
      <P>The safety of our people, in the first instance, requires that approach.  The creation of the greatest possible clarity of outlook on the situation demands that also.  Deputy Cowan expressed that what he is looking for is a Health Bill that will work.  Again, I am assuming in the discussion of this measure that it is a Health Bill that is going to be worked.  It is imperative not to distract ourselves from facing up to facts by ifs and ifs and ifs and it is for purposes of simple clarity that I ask for a picture of the structure of this Bill that causes the Minister to put in this section.  It is this Bill we are talking about, not the 1947 Bill.  The Minister has side-stepped all around the place on that.  Perhaps the situation will disclose itself as we go along. There is a question that I would put again most clearly.  The Minister has indicated that consultation with the local authorities is a matter that he regards as important, whatever he would do afterwards.  I ask again, what is the process, what is the procedure, for the consultation that he speaks about?  Will matters be referred to the full elected county council to be discussed and to be decided by them and to have recommendations or suggestions or opinions or answers passed on by them?  Is that the consultation that the Minister speaks about in connection with this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of this time I would like to find out, possibly by recapitulation, where we are in this. The Minister did say earlier that he thought this section gave power to fix <Col N="778" /> different dates for different local authorities.  That, I understand, is gone; he is not accepting that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember saying that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  That is no longer in the discussion.  That was put.  With regard to the section itself, he has not yet adverted to the limiting words on which a distinction may be made, a distinction of date &mdash; that is to say, for a particular purpose or provision. These are the only two things, I take it, with reference to which different dates may be established through the country generally.  The Minister says that thereafter he is to consult the local authorities.  But he also said, arising out of that reference to consultation with local authorities, that he contemplated regulations which would be enabling regulations.  I take it that that is his view still.  There will be Orders which will enable the local authorities to bring the Act into operation in their districts.  That is an important matter.  It was on that I asked was he going to wait until the most laggard of them was ready or is there some point at which he will determine that, notwithstanding a number of laggard health authorities, he will bring the legislation with regard to certain sections in for the country generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was also asked how he will deal with local authorities in another connection and his answer was that the local authorities would accept the legislation, including the cost.  He was also asked to wave the big stick, so to say, if they did not accept it and have them dismissed and have a special commissioner put in instead.  I should like to know if he can give us any further information on the general views with regard to the section.  I do not think that what we have been told brings us very much more forward.  I appeal to him to deal with this as Ministers deal with other legislation and tell us what are the parts which can be brought in without delay, what parts will require some delay and what parts will require most delay.  Does he propose to adopt the view expressed <Col N="779" /> that he should operate portions of it by overruling a local authority and putting in a special commissioner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <P>To add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Any person who avails himself of any service provided under this Act shall not be under any obligation to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to a health examination or treatment which is contrary to the teaching of his religion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to one particular consideration which may have escaped his notice.  The amendment provides in effect that no person shall be obliged to submit himself to examination or to a service which is contrary to the teaching of his religion. Who is to establish that?  If a person comes up and says to the county manager, &ldquo;I will not submit myself to this examination,&rdquo; and the manager says, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  and he says, &ldquo;It is contrary to the teaching of my religion,&rdquo; and the manager says, &ldquo;I do not believe you,&rdquo; who is to prove it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why he could not accept the statement.  Section 4 as it stands says: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided under this Act or to submit himself... to health examination or treatment.&rdquo;  So that if the manager were to say, &ldquo;I do not believe you,&rdquo; it would be contrary to Section 63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has taken the point.  The <Col N="781" /> amendment reads (amendment read). It does not even say: &ldquo;which he believes is contrary to the teaching of his religion.&rdquo;  It says in clear, definite and distinct language, &ldquo;which is contrary to the teaching of his religion.&rdquo; This is a point of substance.  I bring my mind back to certain controversies which took place in this country some years ago when it was asserted that certain directions that had been given by moral authorities did not, in fact, prove or state what they purported to prove or state.  If a person goes into whoever is responsible for the administration in a county of particular parts of this Bill and says: &ldquo;It is contrary to the teaching of my religion&rdquo; and the official says: &ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; and the person says: &ldquo;I will prove it&rdquo; and brings in theologians A or B, the official may say: &ldquo;I do not believe either of them; you will have to go to court.&rdquo;  There must be affirmative proof of that and not merely a statement.  There is no indication as to how he is to make the case that it is contrary to the teaching of his religion.  You may have the point of view of the theologians and the authorities may say: &ldquo;We do not accept this as authoritative proof that it is contrary to the teaching of his religion.&rdquo;  Certain people in this country have asserted that statements made by episcopal authorities did not mean what they said and were not in accordance with the teachings of the Catholic Church or the moral law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with regard to the section itself.  Its purpose is not to impose an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service or to submit himself to any examination or treatment.  To what extent can that be reconciled with the provisions of the 1947 Act, particularly with regard to infectious diseases? Does the Minister still retain the powers given to him under that Act and the powers given to the local authorities?  While in theory it may be that the parent is not bound to submit his child to examination in the school, in practice it will be very difficult and it will require a very strong willed person to insist that his child <Col N="782" /> shall be exempted from a general examination in the school.  I take it that that is also the viewpoint of the Bill.  On the other hand, I take the view that not merely are those examinations carried on for the benefit of the parents but also for the benefit and protection of the children.  In many cases it is important from the point of view of the child itself that it should undergo these examinations and the treatment shown to be necessary because of examination.  Parents, above all, should be required to secure proper medical examination for their children.  I am not commenting on the amendment which seems to me to be largely superfluous.  The wording is largely put in for dressing.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is a section later in the Bill which deals with the question of vaccination of persons working in air ports and sea ports.  The section, as it stands in the Bill, provides to remove from the 1947 Act the personal right of individuals who opt out of vaccination. If we are going to put in a general omnibus clause relieving every citizen of the obligation to submit himself for vaccination, why then should we go to great pains later in the Bill to deprive individual workers in particular parts of the country from the relief granted them in the 1947 Act in so far as the clause in that Act was concerned in relation to vaccination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of what Deputy Larkin has said in regard to this particular section.  The same point arises, to some extent, in regard to diseases or illnesses of the brain, compulsory examination if you are insane and matters of that kind.  The section as it stands was obviously intended in its drafting to meet certain objections that were made against the other Health Bill.  I think the Minister in the drafting of that particular section went further than he might have gone in a realistic approach to the difficulties that have been mentioned especially by Deputy Larkin.  I think the amendment adds nothing whatsoever to the section, nothing in the world.  Everything that is in the amendment is, in fact, in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> Apparently we have got to state things twice or three times in the Bill to remove grounds of objection.  Section 4 as it stands went, in my view, too far in view of the practical difficulties that exist.  What might have been done in the section was to provide exceptions &mdash; a series of exceptions to which we might have agreed.  It is clear why the Minister brought in the amendment but it adds nothing to what is, in fact, in the section.  For people who cannot read the section clearly it makes it easier for them to understand the section.  It will create difficulties and it would have been much better if in this &ldquo;general saver&rdquo;, as it is called, a series of exceptions were clearly set out.  I think that would have got over the difficulties to which Deputy Larkin referred.</P>
    <P>I do not take the same view as Deputy Costello in regard to the amendment.  The question of religion is a matter for the individual himself. If an individual says: &ldquo;I refuse to submit myself to this examination or to this treatment because it is contrary to my religion&rdquo;, I think that is the end of the matter.  There is no court to be set up to try the issue.  The individual man or woman is, in fact, the guardian and protector of that particular right and it is sufficient for the person to say: &ldquo;I object to this examination or to this treatment because it is contrary to the teaching of my religion&rdquo;.  That is the end of that.  There is no court to say whether in fact it is or it is not.  The court is a person's own conscience and if he says it is contrary to the teaching of his religion that must be accepted by everyone.  It can, of course, create considerable difficulties but that is the interpretation as I see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Larkin raised a rather good point in this section with regard to vaccination.  I believe vaccination is compulsory in this country.  As a result, smallpox is practically unknown here.  In England vaccination is not compulsory and smallpox is comparatively often met with there.  From time to time, particularly in the North of England, there <Col N="784" /> have been quite serious epidemics of smallpox which is a disfiguring disease. Immunisation as introduced in our schools generally has been responsible for a considerable curtailment of the spreading of diphtheria epidemics and has resulted in a great saving of life and in the prevention of certain after effects, such as heart affections.  I think the point raised by Deputy Costello on this amendment in connection with person who submit themselves for examination which happens to be contrary to their religious teaching is a good one.  The Minister would want to clarify that point.  Who is going to make a claim on behalf of the people who are to be examined?  Is a child going to be examined by a health authority or receive some from of treatment in school such as school children receive?  If a parent objects on the grounds of religion that means that the health authority will not be able to carry on as heretofore.  The matter calls for a clarifying statement from the Minister.

      <P>I disagree with Deputy Cowan's interpretation of the amendment. Deputy Cowan suggests that the amendment does not seriously interfere with the section.  I think it alters it very seriously and significantly.  To me the section seems to say that nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided under this Act or to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to health examination or treatment. That is an utterly unqualified statement that under no circumstances shall a man be compelled to submit to health examination.  The amendment says: &ldquo;Any person who avails himself of any service provided under this Act shall not be under any obligation to submit himself or any person for <Col N="785" /> whom he is responsible to a health examination or treatment which is contrary to the teaching of his religion.&rdquo;  Taking the section and the amendment together, I take it that, except on the grounds of religion, a man must submit to examination. There is no qualification whatever in the section.  Under the amendment he can claim exemption only on the grounds of his religion.  That is my interpretation, taking the amendment and the section together.  I wonder if it is correct?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we are dealing with two entirely different matters in Section 4 and in the proposed new sub-section to the section.  Section 4 makes it perfectly clear, as Deputy Keyes said, that no person need submit himself either to examination or inspection or to avail himself of any service under the Act. The amendment says that any person who avails himself of any service provided under this Act shall not be under any obligation to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to inspection if it is contrary to the teaching of his religion.  I think the section is a completely different matter from the amendment.  The section says that no person is under any obligation but in my opinion the amendment is an entirely different matter.  It deals with a person who elects to avail of one or more of the services provided by this Act but who refuses to have any inspection because it may be contrary to his religion.</P>
      <P>Unlike some of the other Deputies here, I am groping, as an ordinary layman. It seems to me under this amendment that a person can demand to receive a service &mdash; because it talks about &ldquo;a person who avails himself of any service&rdquo;&mdash; and, while insisting on getting the service, he can refuse to have any examination of any description carried out on his person. Apparently some of the professional people here do not agree with that but it is the layman's view.</P>

      <P>I can see Deputy Keyes' difficulty in agreeing with the point I make.  To me the section is as <Col N="786" /> clear as a pikestaff &mdash; that nothing in this Act shall impose an obligation on any person to submit himself or any other person for whom he is responsible to a health examination or treatment.  If the amendment were never there, nobody under the section can be obliged to submit himself for health examination or treatment.</P>

      <P>Under the section, you can refuse examination without giving any reason, but the amendment <Col N="787" /> says that you can refuse it if it is contrary to the teaching of your religion.  That is the greatest tripe and cod that was ever put into a Bill.  Let no one say that the amendment improves the Bill in any way.  It does not alter the Bill one bit, but perhaps it can salve certain consciences in regard to it.  Let it do it if it likes. To put it in the Bill means nothing. I have no objection to putting it in the Bill, but the section was even stronger without it because under the section any citizen can say: &ldquo;I will not submit to treatment&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will not submit to examination and I need not give the grounds of objection as religion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister brought in this amendment because, obviously, somebody said that the position was not clear. It was as clear as a pikestaff that if anyone said it was contrary to his religion he need not submit to examination or to treatment.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Very well, if you think that, then I will bring in the amendment.&rdquo; Obviously, that is the line of conciliation on the part of the Minister.  Let nobody say that this amendment adds anything to what is in the section.  It adds nothing to the section but it does not do the section any harm.</P>

      <P>I am not going to vie with the lay theologians from the law library in deciding as to the propriety of the section as already there: I do not think I would be competent.  However, I want to say this in relation to the section as it is.  So long as the new amendment does not limit in any way a person's right to refuse to take part in the service or treatment, I am quite content &mdash; so long as religion is not the only objection which can be raised against taking part in treatment or in any part of the medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin raised a point which I should like the Minister to clarify and that is that nothing in the 1952 Bill will alter those provisions of the 1947 Act which state that the medical officer of health has powers to insist on compulsory examination in relation to certain cases of infectious diseases, venereal diseases and so forth.  I think it is quite important to keep certain <Col N="788" /> powers in that regard and I do not think they are changed here.  I should like to know from the Minister whether or not they are changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that legally this section applies only to this Act and therefore does not apply to the provisions in relation to infectious diseases under the 1947 Act.  Again, with regard to the point made by Deputy Larkin about aircraft workers under Section 31 having to submit themselves to vaccination, that is not a service and, therefore, this sub-section (4) does not apply to that particular obligation on these workers. Deputy Larkin said that, in theory, a parent could forbid his child submitting himself to medical examination, but said that it would be a rather courageous parent who would do so. I do not think so.  It is done fairly often by parents in regard to school medical examinations at the moment and there is no reason why it should not be done in the future.  If they withdraw their children from these medical examinations, they are quite entitled to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, I think I can say that the great majority of legal opinion is on the side of Deputy Cowan, that the sub-section is not necessary.  On the other hand, we had certain people who were, if you like, nervous about the Bill from the religious point of view and as they were satisfied that this particular addendum would improve the sub-section, I saw no objection to adopting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is dealing with amendment No. 1, but in amendment No. 1 there is completely and entirely an addition.  Under the section, what was set out was that it was to be free &mdash; there was the general saver that nothing in the Act or any instrument under it shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided under this Act or to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to health examination or treatment.  What that meant was clear, but the position had to be met of the person who wanted to avail himself of the service and who, when asked to submit to an examination, said: &ldquo;No; it is contrary to my religious belief&rdquo; and who was told that he could not get the service.  There is the position to be met of the person who wants to get the service but does not want to submit to anything in the way of treatment or examination which is contrary to his conscience, and that is a very valuable addition, an addition which is not to be put down to nervousness on the part of certain people with regard to <Col N="792" /> religion.  It is a substantial improvement and a very definite addition.</P>
      <P>The Bill can be improved still further in this regard.  Deputy Costello drew attention to what is now precluded, the compulsion of a person to submit to a health examination or treatment which is contrary to the teaching of his religion and asked who is to be the judge of that.  That seems to be utterly objective &mdash; that somebody would say that what was being imposed on certain people is contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church and in relation to a person who professes that religion is contrary to the teaching of his religion; but when we refer to the Constitution &mdash; not in relation to this matter but to another matter &mdash; where religious points come in, the phrase used is a subjective one. In connection with education, Section 3 of Article 42 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference, to send their children to schools established by the State or to any particular type of school designated by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the English text, the phrase is &ldquo;in violation of their conscience and lawful preference&rdquo; while, in the Irish text, it is &ldquo;in violation of their conscience or lawful preference&rdquo;.  I had always understood that conscience was a term used to indicate a person's own beliefs as he understood these to be, whereas, when you got to such a thing as the teaching of religion, it was something that had to be submitted to a more subjective test, and I say to the Minister, since he has been prevailed upon &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;prevail&rdquo; with inverted commas &mdash; to bring in an amendment of this sort, he should make it complete by accepting what Deputy Costello has suggested and make it &ldquo;contrary to or in violation of his conscience&rdquo;.  That leaves the individual as the person who makes the choice.  If the Minister looks at the two phrases, the phrase taken from the Constitution &ldquo;in violation of conscience&rdquo; and &ldquo;contrary to the teaching of his religion&rdquo;, he will agree that there is at least a possibility &mdash; I think a great probability &mdash; of a difference <Col N="793" /> between the two tests and the test should be the test of the individual himself, of his conscience.  He is not, in other words, to be put on each occasion to the trouble of doing any more than saying: &ldquo;So far as I understand the beliefs of the religion I have, that is contrary to them and I will not submit to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The other improvement I suggest should be made is in regard to the position of the doctor on which Deputy Esmonde touched.  There are so many amendments down to this Bill that it has been described as a somewhat bedraggled piece of legislation, and so it is.  One does not know what is the intention in the mind of the Government with regard to this health legislation and how far contrary to religious scruples it will be pressed, but it seems to me to be clear from certain sections that the doctor, the professional man, may be required to give certain treatment and surely the doctor's conscience ought to be allowed at least a say.  I submit to the Minister that, if he is here making an exception in relation to the person who wants to avail himself of the service and yet objects to certain treatment, there is a similar obligation on him to safeguard the position of the doctor who may contend or hold that certain operational treatment is contrary to his conscience and that he should not be asked to do it, without necessarily leaving the service under the health legislation.</P>
    <P>The last thing of all is, to my mind, the most serious point.  Answering Deputy Larkin, the Minister now tells us that the Bill itself and the amendment are limited by the phrase: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act&rdquo;, and that as vaccination and other things are carried on under other legislation, there is not the same prohibition or compulsion against conscience that there will be in the provisions under this. That, then, opens up a very, very serious prospect.  Do I understand the Minister now to take the line that even though a person protests &mdash; and indicates his objection in a very vehement way and by his resolution to suffer anything in the way of penalties put upon him &mdash; against legislation which he regards <Col N="794" /> as contrary to his conscience, nevertheless the particular treatment will be forced on him?  I was going to suggest to the Minister that he should amend it by saying: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act or any other Act.&rdquo;  I personally thought that amendment was necessary because this Act would be tied together with the earlier Act.  The principal Act is the Act of 1947.  Section 1, sub-section (2) says: &ldquo;The principal Act and this Act may be cited together as the Health Act, 1947, and 1953.&rdquo; Sub-section (2) of Section 3 says: &ldquo;The principal Act and this Act shall be construed together as one Act.&rdquo;  Not merely does this Act import the phrase in the 1947 Act but the matter works in reverse and a prohibition in this Act automatically implies a prohibition in the 1947 Act.  If that is not the position a very serious gap has been revealed and must be filled.  Otherwise we will find certain people anxious about it from a religious viewpoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I made certain observations at the outset of the debate on this amendment.  I confined my remarks entirely to the amendment &mdash; I did not speak of the effect of the section itself &mdash; and I had hoped the Minister would have dealt with the point I raised on this sub-section. I felt and still feel that it is a point of very important substance. He ignored the point I made; he is entitled to do so if he wishes.  I have always understood that when a Minister of the Government in an important Bill of this kind brings in an official or ministerial amendment, he does so with a sense of responsibility and for a particular purpose.  This amendment which is brought in to make it absolutely clear that no person shall be obliged to avail himself of services under the Bill or to submit himself to any examination which he believes to be contrary to his religion has been described as &ldquo;the greatest cod and tripe&rdquo;.  Is the Minister going to stand over that?  Is he going to allow that to pass in connection with an amendment which has been brought in by the Government, the description that it is &ldquo;the greatest cod and tripe&rdquo;?  Is he going to allow it to pass when we all know it was <Col N="795" /> brought in, at whosesoever request it was brought in, for the purpose of calming the fears of responsible people whoever they may be, because what is required to be met here in this amendment was not clear to them in the section?  Is the Minister going to allow that description of the fears of those people and the responsible people themselves to be described as &ldquo;cod and tripe&rdquo; by a Deputy supporting the Government?  I think we are entitled to know what is the Minister's view of that description of a ministerial amendment brought in in the circumstances I have related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this amendment I would direct the Minister's attention to the point I have raised &mdash; perhaps he might take some person's advice other than mine &mdash; that there is nothing in this amendment, if it is put into the section, to make it clear that the person's own view, however informed it may be, on what is and what is not contrary to his religion, is to prevail to safeguard his rights.  Deputy Cowan who has described this amendment as &ldquo;tripe&rdquo; has asserted here that this amendment, if it is put in, will leave it free to the individual concerned to have only the forum of his own conscience in deciding. This amendment does nothing of the sort.  Supposing a person puts forward the view that certain services are or certain suggested treatment is contrary to his religion, and is told by persons in authority that is not so, that does not end the matter. He is then brought before a district justice &mdash; apparently Deputy Cowan has forgotten this.  He is brought in prosecution before a district justice; he is not allowed then under the section merely to stand up and say: &ldquo;this is contrary to my religion.&rdquo;  The district justice says: &ldquo;Prove it, I cannot accept your statement.&rdquo;  The section says you will not get immunity from treatment or indemnity against your refusal to avail of services or to submit to examination unless you prove that it is contrary to the teaching of your religion.  The sub-section says not that he believes it is contrary to his religion, nor that it is in violation of his conscience nor that he has reason <Col N="796" /> to believe that it is contrary to his religion but that it is as an affirmative fact contrary to the teaching of religion.  In a prosecution against him he has to prove that it is contrary to the teaching of his religion and he has to bring theological evidence in the District Court to obtain that immunity. That is my suggested interpretation of that amendment.  The Minister did not deal with the point when I raised it first.  Perhaps he would give it his attention now or submit it to some other legal authority that exists in this House.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking entirely on the amendment, but there are certain obvious objections to the section as it originally stood and as it still stands with this amendment if it is passed. Deputy McGilligan has already directed attention to the serious consequences which will flow from the Minister's interpretation if it be the correct one.  The section says: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided under this Act or to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to health examination or treatment.&rdquo;  Whether the Minister is right in his interpretation or whether there is another interpretation open, it is quite clear that &ldquo;nothing in this Act&rdquo; is the only operative safeguard. Perhaps &ldquo;safeguard&rdquo; is not the word. Even assuming that this phrase was sufficient to bring in the principal Act, the Act of 1947, even assuming it does include any of the other Acts that may be outside these Health Acts, and that the phrase is capable of meaning that nothing in the Health Act or any other Act is to be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to submit himself for examination or avail of services, there is still outside very considerable compulsion that may be put upon a person to avail himself of the services or to submit himself to examination.  The only defence a person has is his refusal to avail of the services or to submit to examination &mdash; that is to say, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent his refusing but there are many things outside the Bill that will bring him in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> If this section had any real significance it would mean that there would be a positive assertion in it rather than what is stated here.  There would have been a positive assertion that no person shall be obliged, or be put under any compulsion, to submit himself to examination.  It may be that there is nothing in the Bill or nothing in any public Act or any Act on the roll of the Oireachtas that imposes this obligation but there are things outside it.</P>
    <P>I think it fair to say that there has been considerable controversy about the provisions of this Bill.  There has been considerable division along political lines about this Bill.  Fine Gael has stood squarely against the Bill and certain other political Parties have stood for it. Those who will be operating this Bill may have their own political views, their own theories about State medicine, and all the rest of it.  Although it may be that one will not be obliged under the Bill to submit to examination, there are many other forms of compulsion to which I need not refer. Take school inspection, to mention only one instance, and think of the particular political complexion of the school teacher and the compulsion that can be applied outside the Bill to compel a child to submit to examination. I say there are very great dangers in the phraseology used in the section&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing in this Act&rdquo;, etc. There should be a positive statement that no person shall be obliged to submit himself to examination or to avail of any services by himself or by any person directly or indirectly.  The section as it stands at the moment means very little.</P>
    <P>I had intended to raise the point but as I said I kept myself entirely to the one point first, that I think that what has been already stated has been stated correctly with reference to the omission from this section of any provision protecting doctors, nurses and officials from being obliged to take part in the administration of services, treatment or examinations which they believe are contrary to their religion.  The section merely says that <Col N="798" />&ldquo;nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person&rdquo; ...The section should go on to say that no doctor, nurse or any person should be obliged to take part in the administration of services or examinations which are contrary to their religious beliefs.</P>
    <P>Another hole, if I might put it that way, in this section is the fact that it merely deals with individuals or classes who may possibly be said to be of a responsible age.  Nothing in the section imposes an obligation, we are told, on any person to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to health examination or treatment. A parent objects, let us say, to having a medical examination for his or her child.  That parent cannot be subjected to any penalty for endeavouring to prevent that child from being submitted to an examination but the school teacher or the medical doctor can operate upon that child in the school in spite of the parent's objection.  It can be said that the child agreed to submit himself to the treatment. The parent may say that he will not allow the child to be submitted for examination but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the school teacher from submitting the child to examination. The section is largely illusory in my opinion.  It is full of holes, even though it may be the desire of the Government to provide proper safeguards. Even with these &ldquo;cod&rdquo; amendments, as they have been described, the section is full of loopholes and full of defects.  A very much more radical approach to what is intended to be effected here should have been brought to bear on this section.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Costello always suffers here from the serious defect of grossly exaggerating his point.  To make the point which he has just made, that a child at school can be forcibly examined against the parents' will and can be sent for operation without the parents' will on the direction of the school teacher, is the grossest exaggeration I have heard from Deputy Costello in this House.  There is a case, a reasonably <Col N="799" /> good case, that Deputy Costello could make, if he would not spoil it by this exaggeration.  This is a very difficult section and I think the House would have welcomed a suggested amendment on the lines Deputy Costello has mentioned. This House could have welcomed an amendment by Deputy Costello, Deputy Mulcahy and the whole Front Bench of Fine Gael, even with Deputy McGilligan thrown in. They could have prepared an amendment that would have helped this House in discussing this Bill but no, they would not bother about an amendment. Now they suggest that the section or even the Minister's amendment is not adequate.</P>

      <P>Let me put this to Deputy Costello.  In the Army we have what is known as a compulsory weekly medical examination of soldiers.  That was introduced in the Army for a very practical or sensible purpose.  It is done every week.  Certain people at these examinations are found to be suffering from particular diseases and they are sent for treatment.  Does Deputy Costello say they should not be examined?  Does he say that they have the right to refuse to be examined if they are discovered to be suffering from syphilis or gonorrhoea?  Does Deputy Costello say they should not be treated?  That is a practical proposition for Deputy Costello.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back over the period when we had this thing out as to whether we should have this compulsory examination or this compulsory treatment.  It is something over 25 years ago since this matter was argued between the medical authorities in the Army and other authorities who are responsible for the morals of the troops.  There was provided in the Army then and there is in every barracks in the country to-day a place known as an E.T. hut at which a soldier who has exposed himself to the risk of a particular infection is obliged by order to attend.  Does Deputy Costello say that should not be done?  Does he say that it is wrong to do that?  That regulation has been in existence for the last 25 years.  It is there to the knowledge of every moral authority in the State.  It is a compulsory provision in order that an individual may safeguard himself against the risk of infection.  Added to that, we have the weekly inspections <Col N="801" /> to ensure that if an individual has become infected immediate steps will be taken to treat him.  Is that not in the interests of the community as a whole?  Let us be realistic about these things.  There are problems that must be dealt with by compulsory methods. There are other matters that arise in relation to individual freedom and individual liberties within this section. If we had a genuine effort on the part of all to cover the two points in this Bill, and particularly in this section, we would get somewhere.</P>
      <P>It is not so very long ago since we in this city were exposed to the danger of typhoid carriers.  Many legal actions arose because of those typhoid carriers.  Many people were stricken and their health very seriously impaired because of those carriers.  Are typhoid carriers to be allowed to refuse treatment?  Are they to be allowed to go around endangering the public? I do not believe they should be.  I think there are matters in which the community can say, and say with justice, that there should be compulsory examination, compulsory treatment and that, until these particular people submit to treatment and are cured, they should not be allowed to go around infecting the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment the Minister has introduced does not add in the least to what is in the section already and apparently, according to the Minister, my view in that respect is supported by the legal advisers of the Minister. Every safeguard that is now in the amendment was already in the section. It was in order to clarify certain doubts that the Minister put in the amendment.  There is no objection to the amendment but objection is being raised to the section because it does not give absolute liberty and complete freedom to a person to refuse to be examined or refuse to be treated, particularly when he is suffering from a social or anti-social disease which may infect other people in the community. It is regrettable that where we have a Bill of this kind and where we have fundamental sections, such as the section now under discussion, we cannot have the help and co-operation of every Deputy.  We have a section <Col N="802" /> of the House led by Deputy Costello, supported by Deputy Mulcahy, leader in another sphere of Fine Gael, saying that it is opposed to this section and because it is opposed to it, it will not permit it to come into operation.  I do not think that is a proper attitude for Fine Gael to adopt.  The majority of Deputies want the Bill.  The great majority want the very best type of Bill this House can pass.  We want the co-operation and help of every Deputy in overcoming the tremendous difficulties that exist in relation to the needs, the protection and the defence of the community and, at the same time, the protection of individual rights and individual liberties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was most unreasonable on the part of Deputy Cowan to try to twist a normal Army inspection held weekly for the purpose of cleanliness into something completely different.  I think that reflects little credit on one who served for a considerable period in the Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it does not reflect well on the personnel at present serving.  That particular disease, referred to so bluntly by Deputy Cowan, has been a rather vexed problem as has the theory and principle of prophylactic treatment generally, a theory and a principle treated by religious of all denominations on the basis of a highly infectious type of disease. Deputy Costello's argument might have been more realistically approached on the basis that he was dealing with normal types of highly infectious or contagious diseases.  One must face reality.  Deputy Cowan when he wants to evade, elude or circumvent a particular point can become very bland and grandiose in his use of certain expressions&mdash;cod, codology.  He then reverts to his typical diatribe against the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In coming to stern grips with the basic problem involved we pride ourselves in this country as being in the forefront of the nations of the world in our tolerance.  It is no good trying to gainsay the fact that certain people <Col N="803" /> are conscientiously convinced of certain things and convinced to such an extent that the impact of this Bill would be tantamount to a penal imposition on their religious beliefs.  The Minister in a more reasonable frame of mind and a less pugilistic mood might examine the fact that there are sections of the community whose religious beliefs will be offended because of the particular design and construction of this section.</P>
    <P>I want to press a particular point: we are seeking to introduce into this type of health legislation a compulsion that is really foreign to the very nature of the people we purport to represent.  There are circumstances in which we all must inevitably accept that compulsion may be necessary in the public interest, but the whole design of this Bill is founded on a mixed philosophy so that one does not know whether it is a forward, socialistic step in medicine, as conceived by Deputy Dr. Browne and possibly by his colleague, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, whether it is based on the ideology conceived by Deputy Cowan, or whether it is, in fact, an abortive conception of a rather torn Fianna Fáil Party in relation to the ultimate effect of the Act.</P>
    <P>While we believe that the Bill is to a large extent a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; Bill, to use Deputy Cowan's expression, it would be a good thing if the Minister realised that by his mulish obstinacy and his refusal to grasp the significance of even the most reasonable request made for the improvement of legislation that is both ill-conceived and ill-designed, he is not helping in any way to ameliorate the lot of those people that this Bill purports to help.  In the final analysis I say that this Bill will be unworkable. Had the Government conceived a practical system of effectively developing and improving the already existing health services that would have been of infinitely greater social benefit to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the amendment.  After the last Deputy's speech, I am going to be a bit careful about what I say because I see a determined <Col N="804" /> attempt on the part of the Opposition to try and catch me up and place me amongst the anti-religious people as opposed to the upholders of religion opposite.  All I will say about that is that it is a contemptible attitude. Deputy Costello talked about the man who finds himself prosecuted in the District Court.  Under what law could a man be found in the District Court, or under what section of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows much more about law than I do.  If a person goes into a hospital and says, &ldquo;I will not accept treatment,&rdquo; will the Deputy tell me under what clause or Act can that person be prosecuted in the District Court?  I am quite sure that the Deputy will not be able to tell me.  All that goes to show that what Deputy Cowan has said is correct, that Deputy Costello is not very particular about what he says in this House&mdash;as regards exaggeration or anything else.  There is no clause under which that person could be brought into the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the Deputy said that we should apply the same clause to doctors and nurses.  Will the Deputy tell me under what clause a doctor can be compelled to give any particular treatment? Can the Deputy point out any clause under which it can be done?  If he cannot, then why does he make the point that we should bring in some clause to cover doctors?  One might excuse an ignorant man sitting on the benches opposite if he made a point like that.  But the Deputy cannot be excused because he knows the law. Therefore, he knows that he is making points which really have no substance in them.  He is trying to confuse the members of this House and the public in general by saying that a patient can be brought before the District Court, if he refuses treatment, and that a doctor can be compelled to administer treatment which, in conscience, he does not believe in, and that the same applies to nurses&mdash;all of which is untrue. I think it is very unfair for a Deputy, who is the Leader of the <Col N="805" /> Opposition, to bring in things like these in order to confuse the issue.</P>
    <P>Some other Deputy said that the fact that the 1947 Act is not covered by this particular clause means that a health authority can insist on compulsory vaccination and compulsory immunisation. In the 1947 Act, there is no such thing as compulsory vaccination or compulsory immunisation.  There are certain compulsory powers in the 1947 Act dealing with infectious diseases, for instance, the power to have a person who is a source of infection, or a potential source of infection to others, removed to an institution.  There is the power to get him there.  That power remains, and that person, under this clause, cannot object to that.  The reason is that he is a danger to others. It is a very different matter when we are dealing with a person who is a danger to others compared to the person who is not a danger to others and is accepting that treatment or examination for his own benefit.  We can afford to allow that person to accept treatment or examination as he thinks fit if it is only his own health that is concerned; but we cannot afford to allow a person to refuse examination or treatment if he is going to be a source of infection to others.  Therefore, the compulsory powers covering infectious diseases must remain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also said that if a parent, for instance, sends a note to the school that he does not want his child examined, the teacher can insist on the child being examined.  If the teacher does that, he is acting illegally. I know a person can do a thing illegally, but all we can do is to make it illegal.  Then the teacher would have no legal right to make that child submit to examination and the teacher would be liable to prosecution if he did so.  We cannot do any more.  Deputy Costello put forward a suggested alteration to the amendment submitted to Section 4.  Fine Gael, having given this Bill their blessing on Second Reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the introduction of State medical services, such as the extension of medical benefits, if in the future one can foresee that doctors may become whole-time employees, surely they should be protected if they feel it is against their conscience to carry out certain treatment?

      <P>We have made it very, very clear that the only reason the Minister is proposing this Bill is to prevent its being publicly demonstrated that the Government is supported by four out of five of the Independents who are keeping them in power, by four who no longer represent in any way the electorate that sent them here and that their own closest part of the electorate, those that elected them formerly to the local authority they represent, would completely disown them if the local elections were held this year.  That is the outstanding thing for which this Bill is introduced.  We have opposed it from the very beginning.  We still oppose it, and we just underline by this statement what we think of the Minister's action in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister was kind enough the other day to tell us that if there was any point which we thought could be discussed better on recommittal he would agree.  I do not think it is necessary to recommit the whole Bill but I would ask him to agree to the recommittal of Section 6 and 18. I do not think it will take very long in either case but the points are difficult points to deal with by way of amendment as the amendments might be out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to add at the end of Section 6 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Such sums as may from time to time be required to pay the interest and sinking fund on the additional land bonds issued in pursuance of <Col N="815" /> this section shall, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, be paid to the Land Commission out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This amendment is considered necessary as I have been advised that the general provision in Section 3 for payments and expenses would not adequately cover this particular charge and a specific provision is considered safer.  The House will recognise that in an important matter of this kind we ought to make it absolutely clear and beyond doubt and that all matters relating to interest and sinking fund and so on should be clarified to the utmost possible extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the amendment, it deals purely with the question of what one might call the bonus bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The bonus bonds, presumably, will be subject to similar, if not the same, provisions as regards sinking fund, repayment and drawings as the other bonds.  One of the reasons I asked the Minister to recommit Section 6 was that I am still not quite clear as to exactly the manner in which these bonds will be issued.  I take it the bonds will be of a different issue from the original bonds in the estate.  Is it proposed that the bonus bonds, while being a different issue, will also be subject to the same rate of interest or will they be payable at whatever rate of interest is the appropriate rate at the date of their issue?  For example, there are cases at present where the bonds have been put to credit in the estate on the appointed day at 4 per cent.  Following the passage of his Bill, bonds of a series bearing a larger rate of interest will be issued.  Is it intended that the bonus bonds to be issued will be part of the general series that will be issued in pursuance of the powers that are now contained in Section 4 of the Land Bond Act, 1934, as amended, or is it proposed that there will be what one might term a special issue purely <Col N="816" /> to satisfy the requirements of Section 6?  If that is the case, on what basis will those special bonds be issued?  As I understand the Bill, it enables the Minister to deal with that.  It is a question of practice more than of the actual wording of the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional bonds will be paid out of the same series and carry the same conditions and the same merit as regards interest, and so on, as the original issue.  The position appears to be that there are bonds available of the different series, 4 per cent. or whatever it may be, and the intention is that the bonus bonds should be of the same series and alike in every respect to those that have been already issued.  I do not know whether I made that position clear. The intention is that they should be all the same category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that on Second Reading the Minister indicated that all these bonds were used up. That is why I am puzzled.  The Minister, when replying on the Second Reading, told us that all the existing bonds were used up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have left the Deputy under a false impression.  The position is that under the Land Bond Act, 1934&mdash;this arises more properly under Section 7&mdash;the category of bonds to be issued for a particular price is determined by the date on which the price is agreed upon or fixed.  For example, prices agreed upon or fixed during 1952 are paid in 4 per cent. bonds.  The date on which untenanted land vests in the Land Commission or the date of issue of the bonds does not determine the category of the bonds. Where prices were agreed upon or fixed before the 1st January, 1953, the Land Commission have proceeded to take possession of the lands in the normal way.  Bonds totalling almost £200,000 have been issued since 1st January last and bonds are still being issued every week.  The cases involved include a few in which prices were fixed by the Land Commission during 1952 and appeals against those prices are pending for decision by the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> I said on the Second Reading:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the 1st January last there have been no land bonds available to enable prices to be agreed upon or fixed for lands which the Land Commission propose to acquire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was not concerned with cases in which prices had been agreed upon or fixed before the 1st January.  There is no shortage of 4 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 3 per cent. bonds for such cases. The point is that, pending the passing of this Bill, the Minister for Finance has not created any bonds for the price fixation period commencing 1st January, 1953, and, accordingly, no price has been agreed upon or fixed since that date.</P>
    <P>I think the point, which perhaps I did not explain correctly and which I have now mentioned, may help the Deputy, that pending the passing of the Bill no bonds have been created, nor will there be until the Bill becomes law.  We have bonds which can be issued to cover the particular transaction that Deputy Sweetman has in mind at the appropriate rate of interest and conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the Minister the last day, he agreed with me that the appropriate date, the date of issue, was the date on which the bonds were put to the credit of the estate, which happens almost immediately after the appointed day.  As I understood the Minister now, he says that in no case has there been any Order fixing by what bonds lands in 1953 are to be taken, where the bonds are to be issued in 1953.  I do not know whether I have correctly understood the Minister in saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular pet case in relation to this section and my difficulty about understanding how that can be is that, in the pet case which I have mentioned to the Minister privately and in respect of which I must admit he has generously come to meet me, the appointed day was fixed on the 15th January and the bonds were issued on the 29th January, 1953. <Col N="818" /> I felt there must be something else here.  That is why I am worried on the point.  I can see what the Minister meant on the Second Reading&mdash;that there were not enough bonds to carry on the general work of the Land Commission, but that there would be enough available of various series to conclude the mopping up operations under Section 6.  But where the other position arises, it seems to me, having regard to that particular case, that I must have misunderstood the date of issue.  It seems to me that that is the crucial point in it.  If the date of issue is the publication of and transfer to the credit of the estate immediately after the appointed day, then it has happened in 1953.</P>
      <P>I understood that the general procedure was that the Minister for Finance every year made an Order which said, in effect, in respect of all bonds issued for lands taken in the year so-and-so, that these lands shall be paid for by means of the issue of bonds of a certain series.  I think that is done as a general practice every year.  In 1952, the practice was, I understand, that they were paid for in 4 per cent. bonds.  In 1953, it is proposed to deal with them otherwise.</P>
      <P>I wonder are we wrong in thinking that the date of issue is the appointed day?  Is the date of issue the date upon which the provisional list is published by the Land Commission in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and which is the list of the lands that provisionally will vest in the Land Commission by reference to a future appointed day in default of a valid objection?  If that is the date of issue, then why that becomes so important in the consideration of Section 6 is that I am not certain about the 11th December date.  Although I know that the date has reference to possession primarily, yet, if the date of issue of bonds was to be prior to the 11th December, I am not certain that we would be in so clear a water as we felt we might be when in Committee. That is why it is so essential to get it absolutely clear as to what is the date of issue specially defined in the various Land Bond Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the date of issue is the date the bonds are paid <Col N="819" /> by the Land Commission to the credit of the estate, which usually follows within a period of one or two weeks after the appointed day.  The appointed day in itself has nothing to do with the category of bonds.  In the case in which the Deputy was interested I think the price was tentatively fixed by the Land Commission before the 1st January, 1953, and the 4 per cent. bonds of 1952 would be applicable to that particular case.  Bonds are still being issued for prices which were fixed before the 1st January, 1953.</P>

      <P>When reading the debate, I thought at one stage I detected in the Minister a further slight outburst of generosity and that he might make the date not the 11th December but the date of the publication of the prospectus for the national loan.  As far as I could see from the figures given by the Minister, it would not affect very many cases from the point of view of the State but it would undoubtedly relieve hardship in the few cases that were dealt with between those dates.  The cases that will be involved in this section concern those people who did not apply, as they were entitled to apply under the 1950 Act, and who get the opportunity of applying under Section 11.  I think that is the section that deals with the extension of the time for redetermination of the price and extending the date back from the 11th December to the date upon which the State itself publicly accepted the rate of interest by the publication of the prospectus for the national loan.  It would, I think, not be unfair on the State and would certainly relieve the position in respect of those people of whose land possession was taken between that date in September and December.  I was away at the time.  The Minister did mention a number of cases.  The Minister had all his figures here but I cannot mention them on the section nor can I find them at the moment in the Official Report.  I think some 92 cases came under the extension of the 1950 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister also gave us the figures in respect of those who would be brought in if we went back as far as the 1st April last. I must confess that I do not value my powers of persuasion so highly as to hope to be able to persuade the Minister to go back as far as the 1st April. But if I could persuade him to go back to the date of the publication of the prospectus of the national loan I think the Minister would be meeting the case very reasonably indeed and would be <Col N="821" /> accepting the date upon which the State and the Government itself determined what was going to be the controlling rate of interest and, therefore, the value of fixed interest securities for the period thereafter.  I do not know whether the Minister could give us the figures as to what amount or what number of cases would be involved.  I cannot find it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position anyway is that we would have had to go back, I think, to the 1st April or even further to cover cases in respect of which it might be pleaded they had suffered. There was no possibility whatever of going back to the 1st April, although the Deputy is quite right in saying that I spoke, perhaps, in a way that made him feel I was inclined to be generous.  What I really had in mind, if Deputies wanted to make the case, was to give them an opportunity to deal with cases in which they were interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman had some in his own experience and I felt that there might be other Deputies who had particular cases, even though I felt I could not go back really.  I would have liked to have heard the type of case they had in mind.  The origin of Section 11 came from a case in respect of which there was human sympathy for the family.  It was a case which was dragged out over a long period of time and affected those who heard about it. That does not necessarily mean that those cases which our withers are meant to be wrung by are always the most deserving, but this particular case&mdash;it was a family case&mdash;received a wide amount of publicity and was a case about which representations had been made by Deputies in the different Parties from the area concerned. Realising there might be other cases of that nature, I wanted to give Deputies over-encouragement, if you like, but with the exception of Deputy Sweetman himself, the other Deputies have not really responded to what I consider to have been an invitation to come along and make a case based on their experience.  There does not seem to have been any great interest in the matter.  I do not think I would be <Col N="822" /> justified in going further than I have to make the date retrospective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 deals with limited administrators.  That is a matter about which we had a good deal <Col N="824" /> of discussion on the last day when we were discussing this Bill.  On that occasion, I made a point to the Minister in connection with the insertion of the words &ldquo;for the purposes of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts&rdquo; in the section.  It is in sub-section (4) at the top of page 9. I said that, for the purposes of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts (including this Act), land registered under the Registration of Title Acts was an anomaly, that, in fact, once the land purchase proceedings had terminated, the land then went to Registration of Title Acts for the first time, and, therefore, once land had come under the provisions of the Registration of Title Act there could not be any further proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts.  I have since been able to ascertain, through the courtesy of the Minister's officials, the type of case in which there can be proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts.  I now appreciate that the drafting effect of this section is not the effect which I thought it was intended it should have.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister intends this section solely to deal with those cases which have come under the Registration of Title Acts where the Land Commission are contemplating arranging an exchange.  I do not think it is right that the Registration of Title Acts should be amended by what one might term a side-wind in this way.  Either we should have a complete amendment or we should not amend at all.  The position at present is that in the case of very small holdings&mdash;it nearly always arises in the case of very small holdings, holdings which sometimes have been abandoned &mdash;where the Land Commission appointed a limited administrator for the purpose of ensuring that they can get satisfactory user and so forth, proceedings are taken under the Land Acts in respect of that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these proceedings and the appointment of a limited administrator, in certain circumstances the vesting goes on to the Land Registry and the holding is then vested in the person named as the limited administrator. As I understand it, the whole <Col N="825" /> idea of limited administratorship is to avoid having to incur the very substantial expense that would be incurred in respect of taking out administration in the ordinary way to the type of case that is involved.  I think we would all agree that it is desirable&mdash;if we can at all&mdash;to avoid that expense, provided we can do it with reasonable safeguards for the rights of people who might otherwise be affected.</P>
    <P>This Bill, however, is going to create, in so far as this sub-section carries it into effect, a situation in which a number of people will be registered in the Land Registry as limited administrators.  They are going to be there on the register as such limited administrators.  As I understand it, this section is intended to imply that they are not going to be able to deal in any way with the land when it is registered in their name except, of course, for the simple purpose of arranging an exchange with the Land Commission.  That will have the effect of having on the register of title a certain number of people&mdash;not many I agree, but a certain number of people &mdash;who have had their land vested in them by the Land Commission as limited administrators and who will not be able to deal with that land at all without having to do exactly what the Minister desires to avoid doing, namely, incurring the heavy expense of taking out the grant of administration.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister's point of view, that perhaps that might be more a matter for Justice than for this Bill but this is the Bill which is going to create that position, and it is not right that the Minister should by this Bill create the situation in which there are going to be any number of people, whether large or small, registered in the Land Registry as the registered owner, within the meaning of the Registration of Title Acts, but unable to deal with the land.  It means, in effect, that any time any one of these wants to deal with the land, he will have to go back over the title not merely in the Land Registry but in the Land Commission, leading to the situation which the Minister short-cut, if I may put it that way, by the <Col N="826" /> provision in this section.  I do not think that is either desirable or reasonable. I think the position should be that limited administrators should be appointed for the sole purposes of the Land Commission proceedings and that the land, if it is to be registered, should be registered in them, subject to equities, when no note of the limited administratorship arises on the face of the registry and when, then, the matter can be dealt with, if it is necessary to discharge the note as to equities.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental basis also of the provision in the Agricultural Credit Acts by virtue of which purchase by registered owners can be accepted in certain circumstances, without the equities being discharged; but what the Minister proposes here is to place year after year a certain number of people on the register of title who will have no right whatever to deal with the land in respect of which the Land Commission are registering them, without having to do exactly what the Minister by this section seeks to avoid compelling them to do for the purposes of land purchase proceedings.</P>
    <P>On a general principle, the Minister will agree with me that, if it is desirable to avoid a certain expense for the purposes of one Department, it is also desirable in relation to the other. These limited administratorship cases arise only in circumstances where the value of the holding does not make it worth while to go to the expense of taking out administration in the ordinary way and the effect of this will be that a certain number of people all over the country will be added every year to the list of those who will be in the position that some day, sooner or later, they will have to incur very substantial expense.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister would wish that for a moment and I think he will agree that dealing with it in that way merely because the Registration of Title Acts are perhaps under the control of the Department of Justice rather than under his own control is not a conclusive answer to the point. It could be done quite easily by another method&mdash;by the Land Commission appointing the person as limited administrator and vesting it in him <Col N="827" /> without reference to his limited administratorship. His administratorship would be part of the equities and would arise as such and would not be a blot on his title for evermore unless he spent that money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not really changing the law in this regard, although one might argue from hearing Deputy Sweetman that we were.  The appointment of limited administrators to overcome the difficulties which the Land Commission have in dealing with the estates of deceased persons has been in the Land Acts since 1870 and very specifically in Section 54 of the 1939 Act.  A doubt has been raised, I think, by the registration of title people themselves, as to whether the position is quite clear.  They want to be absolutely satisfied that, from their point of view, the position is watertight legally and that these administrators have always had the power which the statutes, in our opinion, meant them to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Deputy raised the matter on the previous stage I was under the impression that he had only land purchase dealings in mind but he seems to have had in question other types of dealings in which the Land Commission are not involved at all. The legal advisers take issue very strongly on the point that we could not possibly agree to introduce into this measure provisions which would amend the Registration of Title Act, that it would be quite anomalous to attempt to do it.  It is not merely that the Land Registry&mdash;though I am often blamed for their misdeeds, if they are misdeeds&mdash;belongs to another Department, the Department of Justice, but that the Registration of Title Acts are a separate type and body of legislation and we would be contravening all the principles for which the draftsman stands if we were to attempt by a side-wind to amend them in the way Deputy Sweetman suggests.  I have some sympathy with his point of view but I think he has more or less accepted that in fact we would be amending these Registration of Title Acts if we were to do as he wishes.  Having considered the matter and having gone into it I <Col N="828" /> do not think it is possible to do it on this occasion.  We have to confine ourselves simply to making clear the law and the powers which we believe have been there, in so far as completing proceedings in which the Land Commission is directly concerned, involving these limited administrators and I cannot take it on myself to extend their functions in any other way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's point of view, but at the same time I think it is wrong.  What is being done now is making a substantial extension of the wording of the 1939 Act and even if the Minister says that what he is doing in fact is clarifying what was intended in the 1939 Act, I do not necessarily think that that is what was intended at all.  The point I want to make is twofold.  There is the point he has answered and I have a certain amount of sympathy with him&mdash;he does not want to amend the whole of the Registration of Title Acts by a side-wind and what I want to do would perhaps be doing that.  I think the Minister will agree, however, that while it would be doing so, it would be doing the job in a much tidier manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, the Minister does not want to do that, there is another way &mdash;and a way to which there will not be the same objections, that is, to have the person appointed as a limited administrator for the purposes of the Land Purchase Acts alone.  That will give the Land Commission the power and the right to appoint these limited administrators for land purchase proceedings and then it will not in any way interfere with the Registration of Title Acts.  If the Minister thinks that doing that would not enable him to utilise this power for an exchange of holdings, he could deal with the power to appoint a limited administrator under the Registration of Title Acts for the sole purpose of an exchange of holding by a separate section, or by making it a separate sub-section, but the objection I have to it is that by the positive act of the Minister in this Bill or, if the Minister so wishes to put the argument, by Section 54 of the 1939 Act, we are going to build up in the Land Registry a number of cases which will be growing year by year and <Col N="829" /> which can never be unravelled except by going to very substantial legal cost which will never be justified by the value of the holdings concerned.  It will, in fact, mean that in regard to these holdings which are thrown into the register by this section, they will be there for all time in a state of legal chaos.  It could be done the other way, and if it were done the other way under the Registration of Title Acts, the ordinary 12 years of the possessor in title would be sufficiently operative to get the equities discharged without this expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree with me if there has been no claim against limited administrators for 12, 15, 20 years, then there is no real equity still subsisting and the matter can be dealt with without expense.  There is a provision in the rules by which it can be dealt with without expense.  Once the person is put in there as limited administrator, he is there as a trustee, must remain as a trustee through the whole of his possession and never take adverse possession under what the ordinary person understands by a squatter's title, and that it is going to mean that in respect of every single one of those holdings, which will be very small in value, we will have heavy legal expense thrown upon them.</P>
    <P>I know the Tánaiste, sitting next to the Minister, dislikes the lawyers intensively even when he is kind enough to describe them by certain adjectives as I heard him describe them on Sunday, but in any event we will all agree that it is entirely unnecessary to impose the hardship of the cost that will be involved in these cases if we can find any way out of it.</P>
    <P>The way I would have preferred to find out of it was the way I advocated on the last occasion and the way I advocated earlier.  If the Minister says he cannot accept that I must bow to his point of view.  I think it would be a tidier way but if he cannot accept it he can still do it the other way and I would urge on him very strongly to consider with his legal advisers between now and the time this Bill goes to the Seanad some new method of getting what he wants under this section in respect of land purchase <Col N="830" /> proceedings which we are all prepared to give him; and having got what he wants in respect of land purchase proceedings, to consider getting at the same time a method by which the vesting order which goes to the Land Registry will go without reference to the limited administratorship but subject to the equities, so that in that way the rights of any person as next of kin or otherwise would be against the land and would be protected under the administratorship and yet our rights would cure themselves in the course of time by the comparatively cheap methods included in the Land Registry rules for the purpose of avoiding expense of many administrations. There will probably be not one but two or three administrations in the various cases involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The limited administration provisions in the 1939 Act are spent when the Land Purchase proceedings with which they are concerned are completed and we are not attempting to extend, as I have said, further than to make it quite clear that it is the intention that the end of the proceedings may be in every way correct from the legal point of view. We are not attempting in any way to extend their jurisdiction and if we did it I think we would have to amend all these Acts and the Registration of Title Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the expenses, this is a serious matter undoubtedly and Deputy Sweetman may very well be a public benefactor in suggesting that this should be done.  However, it strikes me that apart from the fact that this is not the appropriate measure and I am not the appropriate Minister&mdash;either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance, perhaps, could deal with it&mdash;we would, in fact, be differentiating between the limited class of cases in which the Land Commission is interested and other classes because obviously if we are going to extend the jurisdiction of the limited administrators in the cases where the Land Commission has proceedings, there is no reason why, on the ground of equity, we would not have the same jurisdiction and the same system of limited administration. <Col N="831" /> I suppose, for all cases of hardship generally we would simply be opening the door further.  Deputy Sweetman is trying to persuade me I have opened it a little; perhaps I have peeped out, but I think he wants me to throw it wide open, and I do not feel it is my job at all.  I will mention it to the Minister for Justice and we will see by the time we reach the Seanad if there is anything in the point, but I do not think the Deputy's suggested amendment is quite in line with the provisions of the proceeding Land Acts.  However, I shall ask the legal advisers to have another look at the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It affords me special pleasure to say a few words in support of this Bill.  I represent an area that has benefited considerably from the development of our peat resources, an area that looks forward with confidence to the future.  This barren land is now a hive of activity, the hum of machinery and the talk of the working gangs replace the silence of the past and have converted an area that was desolate and waste into an area that will be of some use to the nation. Our people from that district heretofore went to England, and now I am looking forward to some change so that those people will get work at home in their own areas and play their part in this revolutionary change which will benefit the Irish nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> In addition to the work provided in that area I see that we can now hope to make some use of the land; when it is reclaimed it will be a source of profit to the nation.  I am pleased to hear that the production of milled peat has now passed beyond the experimental stages and that its future is assured.  On behalf of the people of North Mayo, I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done and on the foresight and courage he has displayed in the development of our bogs and peat resources.  In addition, the land from which the peat is taken will, I am sure, be capable of reclamation and of productive use for the nation. The pioneers of this work are definitely entitled to anything they are getting or any benefit which they may derive under this Bill.  I know that there will be no difficulty in getting plenty of workers, now that they are assured of houses.  The provision of suitable housing accommodation will mean that we shall get contented workers in the various turf areas.  Once we provide the houses we shall have no trouble in getting workers.</P>
    <P>I regret to hear that measures have had to be taken to compel certain people to use native fuel.  It is hard to understand, why, in present circumstances, imported fuel should be used by anybody, especially in an area such as North Mayo where an abundance of native fuel is available.  It is not unreasonable to expect that people should co-operate in the policy of using native fuel wherever possible. I was therefore pleased to hear the Minister say that he would insist upon native fuel being used.</P>
    <P>During the debate last week, I heard Deputy Blowick, one of the Deputies for South Mayo, complain that in North Mayo a considerable quantity of turf had not been taken over by Bord na Móna and that it had been left on the producer's hands.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, so far as North Mayo is concerned, all the hand-won turf from last year's crop has now been taken over and that no surplus turf in the area has been left on the producer's hands.  That is certainly a matter for which we should be grateful. <Col N="833" /> The area I represent is one in which a very considerable quantity of turf is produced annually.  Our fuel resources are virtually the only natural resources on which a large number of our people have to rely and I am pleased to know that all the hand-won turf available for sale in North Mayo has now been purchased.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would consider the question of paying a subsidy of so much per ton for the carriage of turf from outlying districts in my constituency, especially from areas such as the parish of Aughoose and Doohoma.  These districts are approximately 40 miles from a railway station and if a subsidy were made available there would be plenty of hand-won turf produced there.  In these areas, the only work available is that of producing hand-won turf, that is turf cut by the ordinary sleán.  I feel that the people in these areas are as well entitled to get a subsidy as people who are sending beet to Tuam or elsewhere.  There is no hope of growing beet in this area.  It is a poor, desolate area, in which practically no other work is available and if work is not provided for the people on the bogs, there is no prospect open to them except to trek across to a foreign country.  I would make a special appeal to the Minister, now that the market for hand-won turf is being developed, that he might consider the possibility of giving a special subsidy for the carriage of turf from North Mayo, especially from those areas which are 40 or 50 miles distant from a railway station. As I say, I think we are as much entitled to such a subsidy as the people who are sending beet along to Tuam or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have heard some lamentations to the effect that our people will not work in the bogs.  I can assure the Minister that, so far as North Mayo is concerned, the migratory labourers there will be only too happy to work in the bogs, now that they are assured of a market for the turf which they produce. If they are assured of work for two, three or four months in the year, they will be delighted to remain at home and will have no desire to cross the water in search of work.  The present <Col N="834" /> development of turbary in the area means that the people are guaranteed definite work for the season and there will be no trouble in getting plenty of labour in this area in the future.  People there are hoping that they will be employed full-time and thus avoid the necessity of having to trek across to foreign lands.  In conclusion, I wish again to thank the Minister for his foresight and courage in attempting to develop our fuel resources to the full and I can assure him that the people of the area I represent will avail to the utmost of the work which is now provided for them. It is the only work they have and I again thank the Minister for the steps he has taken to ensure that such resources will be utilised to their fullest extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to stand in the way of the Minister but, as a Deputy from an area to which turf produce is of so much importance, I should not like to let the opportunity pass without saying a few words by way of complimenting all concerned on this Bill.  The Bill is of primary importance for a number of workers in Bord na Móna and the people who comprise that important organisation, which has proven to be such a great success.  I think these people are deserving of any praise we in this House can give them for the great success they have made of an undertaking which had not the full support of everybody in this House at one time.  One has only to visit the experimental station in Newbridge nowadays to realise the strides forward which Bord na Móna has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To mention one item in particular, the Móna jet burner which they have brought into being has revolutionised the entire fuel production in this country and has created new hope in the minds of people who hitherto had not much to say in favour of the efforts that were being made to develop our native fuel.  The introduction of the Móna jet burner has meant the inception of a new era for turf producing areas and I believe it will succeed in outsting many types of imported fuel hitherto used for heating purposes in this country.  It compares <Col N="835" /> favourably with any other system and I think that when its merits are more generally known it will be widely availed of by the people generally, particularly in parts of the country where imported fuel has been used up to the present.</P>
    <P>I have a special reason to congratulate the Minister for anything he is doing for the people who constitute the organisation of Bord na Móna.  We are particularly grateful because one of the turf fired generating stations is to be located in West Donegal.  We think it is not before its time and we are sorry that it was not done before so that many of our people who were obliged to emigrate from these congested areas could have remained at home and found work amongst their own people.  The development of our peat resources has brought new hope to these people who live in desolate areas and who own practically nothing but tracts of bog of no special value. They see new hope in the future and I believe we are on the eve of a great future for the people in these congested areas.  There is no doubt that our native fuel development has reached the stage wherein we can look forward with confidence to a bright future for our people and I believe that our efforts will be crowned with success.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that more Opposition Deputies were not interested in this matter.  As one who represents a turf producing area I would like on behalf of the people there to congratulate the Minister.  Every step he has taken to develop our peat resources is fully appreciated by the people.  We congratulate the Minister on the efforts he has made and on the success he has achieved to-date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister in furthering the aims and activities of Bord na Móna through the medium of this measure.  It is a very important measure from the point of view of a county such as mine where turf production is of paramount importance. It was interesting to listen to the few speakers on the Opposition Benches who contributed to this discussion. <Col N="836" /> It was interesting to notice their reaction to Bord na Móna and all it stands for.  It was interesting to compare that reaction to-day with the reaction in bygone years when this project was first mooted.</P>
      <P>We were told to-day that the Minister should not take any credit for the project under way in Bangor Erris. We were told that the success of that development is due entirely to the production of milled peat.  While I agree with that to a certain extent I must say that, were it not for the Minister and others with vision, we should never have got to the stage of milling peat here.  During the recent past we had two generating stations which were not designed to burn native fuel. In the past two years, since the return if Fianna Fáil to office and since the return of the Minister for Industry and Commerce we have not just two stations but six stations under way for the burning of native fuel.  It is only right that these matters should be kept before the public mind, particularly in relation to the congested counties where turf is of such value and is, as has been said, one of the very few assets available.  We must recognise in the present Minister one who has believed in turf all through his career, one who has done everything possible to foster and encourage that industry. The fact that the industry has reached its present level of development is due in no small measure to the Minister's efforts and foresight.  If we are to continue along that happy road to the full utilisation of our native turf resources any measure designed to foster and encourage Bord na Móna by way of financial subvention should have the backing of every Party in this House. If there are some who, despite their mistaken ideas in the past, cannot even to-day stand wholeheartedly behind this development at least they should not stand in its way.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one comment to make, more by way of suggestion than by way of criticism.  Bord na Móna has done excellent work but, being a partially Government financed board or authority, there is danger that it may be <Col N="837" /> inclined in the future to treat the work entrusted to it in a manner which may not give the best economic return. It has been suggested to me by people outside, people whom I regard as being in a position to know, that a certain tightening up could be carried out within the organisation in order to ensure a better return in the future. We should not feel that because we have a very excellent organisation and because Bord na Móna has done a very good job there is no room for improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a couple of points in particular rather than with the general position under this Bill.  If I were to adopt the line adopted by Deputy Blaney the Minister would not get his Bill to-night, but I have no desire to hold him up.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want the Minister to give us a little more information about milled peat.  As I understand it, the scientific advance&mdash;if I may so describe it&mdash;now being made is an advance in the direction of treating peat by cutting it with something akin to a lawnmower, bringing it in milled form and burning it as such in the generating stations.  It is not intended to put it through any part of the processes that are utilised on the existing briquette production at Lullymore. That briquette production has had an unhappy history in certain aspects. Dealing with milled peat that goes into the briquette-making machines is something that requires a pretty light touch, if I may so describe it.  The very slightest degree of neglect in dealing with valves and flues or in the cleaning of valves and flues has, unfortunately, in the past, led to serious, and sometimes fatal, accidents.  I want to know from the Minister whether generation will be done on the same type of machinery or will it be an entirely different type.  I think the Minister referred to it in his opening speech as a liquidising method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Fluidising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a wealth of difference in the technical aspect of the terms but to the layman there is not a great deal of difference <Col N="838" /> between fluid and liquid.  It is I think important that if there is going to be a substantial difference, as I believe there is, it should be appreciated by the lay people concerned.</P>
      <P>The other thing I want to mention is the question of housing.  The board has started substantial housing colonies in the County Kildare.  The effect of Section 3 of the Bill is to give grants to the board&mdash;as I understand it, to give exactly the same grants as would be given to a local authority building the same type of house.  These houses are, however, tied houses. There is a certain amount of resentment amongst the personnel who are working for the board in the Blackwood and Allenwood areas because the only terms on which they can go into the houses are that they can remain in them only during the currency of their employment.  Of course, the effect of that is that the local people do not like to go into them at all.</P>
      <P>I think that we had a commission some years ago dealing with the whole question of tied cottages.  As far as I can remember, it reported very strongly against them.  That commission was very strong on the point that any system of tied houses was a retrograde step rather than an advance.  Yet in this Bill&mdash;not necessarily in the Bill by itself, I agree, but by this Bill&mdash;we are further advocating the system of tied houses. I wonder whether it is the better way of dealing with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add, perhaps, that one of the things that we were somewhat disappointed with in Kildare was that Bord na Móna came to the Kildare County Council and asked it to take over all roads and services appertaining to its settlement village, if I may use that term.  We felt that we could not possibly do that when the request was for a private tied concern.  If the houses were to be let to the public in the ordinary way&mdash;naturally enough they would be let in the initial instance, possibly, to employees&mdash;then the local authority would have a function in the matter.  But we did not feel that we were entitled as a local authority to step in and do something that was not <Col N="839" /> for the benefit of the public, but only for the benefit of a particular class, no matter how deserving that class may be.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to reconsider whether it is wise to tie these houses, quite apart from their first allocation to employees.  If the employment is worth while, and if the houses are occupied, then Bord na Móna will have no difficulty in getting employees. I can see the anxiety of Bord na Móna that it will have a population near an area from which it can draw the labour pool it requires.  I do not think the right way of doing that is to insist that the people concerned should work for Bord na Móna by the threat of being dispossessed from the house.  I think that a much better method of dealing with it would be to have the houses and the population there, to make the terms of work with the board so satisfactory and so enticing that the people would come willingly to work rather than feel that they were under compulsion to do so.</P>
    <P>I was also rather disappointed that the Minister, when extending the capital power of Bord na Móna to such a degree, did not give us some indication as to the future&mdash;what I mean is, after the bogs have been cut out.  Some people are inclined to say that that is a very long way off.  I do not think that, in parts, it is going to be anything as far away as some people anticipate, though I do feel that, perhaps, by the utilisation of the milled process rather than by the machine-sod process, the life of a bog may extend over a long period, since the cutting will be over a wider area than is the case at present, with the big baggers working on a machine cutting.  No matter what benefit we, in our generation, may derive in respect of the utilisation of our bogs, if we are going to leave them to the generation that comes after us as mere lakes or waste spaces, it will be a very temporary achievement indeed.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that there was not enough attention given in the cutting of a bog to the forestry that should come after it&mdash;that there was not enough attention given to the cutting in such a way that planting would be <Col N="840" /> reasonably feasible.  That may have been due to planting on a short-term basis, first of all, for the purpose of building up the humus of the cutaway bog, then planting trees on a short-term basis to provide material for perhaps wall board, and, finally, planting your hardwoods and so develop on a long-term basis.  It would be disastrous if this were to be treated merely on a short-term basis with no thought, no plan and no co-ordination as to what was to come after the cutting was finished.  In parts of the country to-day one can see where in the past bogs were cut very low, that there is nothing now to be seen except a swamp in the winter.  If we are going to substitute the Bog of Allen, in the middle of the country, with a lake, after our day, then I do not think we shall have done much except to deal with this on a purely temporary basis.  I do not think, however, that is the desire of any of us.  We are coming very quickly to the time, in certain areas, when the big baggers which have been working for some years, will have gone down as far as it is intended they should go. I, therefore, suggest that work should be started in those areas on what will lead to permanency.</P>
    <P>Originally, our county council was asked at one time to consider the building of those houses.  We put a query as to what was proposed after the bog was cut out, the life of which we could not tell&mdash;whether it would mean 20 years cutting by the bagging machines?  I should like to have some indication from the Minister as to what the programme is on those cutaway portions, and whether it is not possible now to start work on that rejuvenation simultaneously with the machines working on the nearby strips. I think it is desirable that we should know, at this time when we are extending to such a degree the financial scope of Bord na Móna, what the position in that regard is going to be. I think this is the appropriate time for the Minister to give us some little indication of what the board have in mind.  The Minister may not be able to do so now because, apparently, if he gets in he will not be able to finish to-night.  Perhaps he would be able to get the information for us before <Col N="841" /> to-morrow, when, I take it, he will be concluding on this stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned, I had finished what I had to say, and I hope some of the things which I was forced to say. I was trying to make the case, in so far as I was allowed to make anything at all, that the Minister on this Bill cannot dismiss the questions which have been put up from this side or the statements made as to the various interpretations which can be placed or which will afterwards be placed either on the section or the amendment in the way he did.  I do not think he is properly discharging his duty to the House by refusing to answer the statements which are made from this side of the House, by contenting himself with saying that &ldquo;this is just pure obstruction by Fine Gael.&rdquo; That is an easy way out for the Minister if he does not want to try and meet the points which are being made.  I do not think it is a line which the Minister should take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister himself believes that Deputy Costello would get up in this House and lightly make statements on a section, or on the interpretation of a section, which he did not believe.  When the Minister charges Deputy Costello with doing that, I do not believe that the Minister <Col N="842" /> himself thinks for a moment that that is what Deputy Costello is trying to do, and nothing more.  We get cheap sneers about Fine Gael's attitude in not putting down amendments and at the same time suggesting, as the Minister put it, improvements that could be made.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Costello, and other Deputies from this side, have tried to do on this section in particular, is to show the danger that lies in the section. Our consistent line on this matter is based on sound reasons, on reasons which appear at least to us to be sound.  We are merely stating views which we are entitled to state, even if certain Deputies do not agree with them.  We are being asked, either to support this Bill in its entirely and to accept each section as it stands, or else, to use the Minister's words, &ldquo;clear out and let the House deal with it.&rdquo; That statement, by the way, was not an original one.  That same statement was made on a former occasion by a distinguished predecessor of the Minister's, but it was not we who cleared out.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is not helping the position very much by contenting himself with accusing this Party, and the members of it, with being just in an obstructionist mood, and for that reason, and no other reason, speaking on any section or amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of parents and of school children was raised in the discussion on this amendment, as well as the position in which children find themselves subject to influences that are outside any statutory control.  The position, in fact, is that these influences are strengthened very much by the whole approach of the Fianna Fáil Government to health legislation, to the coercive powers that are there to impose penalties on, say, the managers of schools who do not co-operate in the general working out of the scheme of things.  A certain amount of compulsion is gradually being withdrawn.  The amount of compulsion that was enshrined in the whole body of the 1945 Act broke that <Col N="843" /> Act.  The amount of compulsion enshrined in the 1947 Act has taken substantial sections out of that Act, but the elements of compulsion and direction and of forcible interference by the State are still so present that they add&mdash;if they are not the principal instigators&mdash;to those outside forces of which I speak.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the atmosphere in which school medical inspection was originally carried on, the atmosphere that surrounded it up to 1947.  I think no one can deny that the scope of the work done up to 1947 was of a highly satisfactory kind.  No one can suggest that it was not work that was gradually winning approval.  It was winning the willing acceptance, one might say, of the entire people who came in contact with it.  It is just questionable whether the Minister will improve, or add to the staff capable of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>It was the lack of quantity, rather than of quality in the service, that was most felt up to 1947.  But, up to 1947, the spirit in which school medical inspection was carried out was the spirit in which the regulations were prepared under the 1919 Act.  Under that Act, the work of school medical inspection was carried out in accordance with regulations made by the Department of Local Government, following the old Local Government Board.  The original Act enacted that &ldquo;the local authority shall act in accordance with the regulations made by the Local Government Board and approved by the Treasury and the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am continuing the discussion that took place on the situation with regard to the obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided under the Bill and with the matters that could be raised to excuse himself.  That, as well as with the question of children and of children's parents, is included in this <Col N="844" /> matter.  During that discussion, the question was raised that there was no provision in the section which dealt with the case of children whose parents might not wish them to be dealt with under the school medical treatment, but who would actually be dealt with because of extra statutory influences operating around them, such as the influence of the doctor carrying out the inspection, or the influence of the teacher or of some other element in their surroundings.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he cannot very well help that.  I am pointing out a very definite thing that is creating and strengthening these influences.  I am pointing out that one is the complete change of spirit in the approach to dealing with school medical inspection. One of the things in the 1944 Act was that children would not be allowed to go to school if they had nits in their hair.  I want to point out the spirit that surrounded the administration of the School Medical Inspection Act up to 1947 when that Act was changed.  Regulations were made under the 1919 Act in accordance with sub-section (2) of the Act.</P>
      <P>They provided, in the first place, that the county council must take account of any treatment that parents are getting for their children from private doctors; in the second place, that parents should be invited and, moreover, encouraged to be present at the school inspection of their children; thirdly, that women doctors ought to be provided for girl pupils; fourthly, that any medical advice resulting from this examination should be sent to the parents; that medical inspection in any school must be arranged so as to suit the convenience of the school authorities and teaching staff and so as to bring about the minimum possible interference with, or disturbance of the school arrangements.  There was no compulsion on the school. There was no threat of penalties against the managers, nor were the local authorities given any dictatorial powers to run such schemes as they might themselves decide.  The whole spirit was the spirit of encouragement, the spirit of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1947 Act completely changed the <Col N="845" /> whole spirit of the approach.  The compulsory and dictatorial spirit in considering matters in the Government is enshrined in this whole series of legislation, no doubt from the intention of the 1944 Act to the actual details of the 1945 Act, that so misfired.  I should not say misfired.  It got an awful lot of fire, so much fire that it disappeared.  Then there was the 1947 Act.  I suggest to the Minister that if he could perhaps arrange to safeguard people in this Bill against that, but at any rate, safeguard children against these outside and extra statutory actions, it would be a change in the approach of his Department and himself to health matters.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's word but I find it somewhat difficult to follow the advice of his legal advisers. At one point it appears the two Acts are completely separate.  When we come to another point they are a combined Act.  It is not my responsibility to ensure that the Minister retains the powers that we mentioned in the discussion of Section 4, namely, to deal with cases of infectious diseases.  There he told us very definitely that he had been advised that that particular section was not going to interfere with or militate against the powers given under the Principal Act.  If there is that chasm between the two Acts, how then do we connect up when we come to deal with Section 8?  I am quite prepared to accept the position that regulations made under this present Bill will have to be laid on the Table of the House so far as it is provided for under the Principal Act but I hope the Minister's legal advisers are correct in regard to the effect of Section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Deputy will look at Section 4, he will see that it is a bit different because it applies only to this Act.  The general principle appears to be that the Principal Act governs this Act in the way of regulations, and so on.  However, I will make sure of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by Order made in respect of a specified health institution, direct&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in the institution,</P>
      <P>(b)  that institutional services of a specified class shall not be given in the institution,</P>
      <P>(c)  that institutional services shall be given in an institution to a specified class of persons, or</P>
      <P>(d)  that institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a specified class,</P>
      <P>and the health authority maintaining the institution shall comply with the direction.</P>
      <P>This new section, which it is intended to insert before Section 9, is designed to enable the Minister to control the uses to which local health institutions may be put.  I want first of all to emphasise, so that there will not be a misunderstanding, that this new section I am now proposing will apply only to local authority institutions and does not apply to voluntary hospitals or private institutions of any kind. Under Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, the Minister has similar control at present over the services which can be provided by the individual district institutions maintained by public assistance authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in speaking on another section, it is merely to give the same power, now that institutions are being <Col N="848" /> handed over to health authorities, to the Minister as he had when these institutions were under the public assistance authority.  As far as I know, the section has not been invoked in the past and I hope it will not be necessary to invoke the section in future.  On the other hand, it is well that the power should be there in case any health authority is not making the best possible use of its institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that he requires this power for the purpose of directing that certain operations will take place in one particular hospital or that a particular hospital should concentrate on the carrying out of certain operations? The Minister's remarks rather suggest that there may be a possibility under this proposal that in one county the carrying out of certain operations can be prevented and that operations of that particular kind will be carried out in the neighbouring county, thus developing a kind of regional system. The suggestion, at any rate, is that the Minister wants power to interfere ministerially in the type of work that will be carried on in the hospitals.  I understand that there is a medical centre in every county and a county surgical hospital in every county.  Do I understand that the Minister is taking power to restrict the type of operations which can be carried on in particular county hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather straining the section to say that it could be used for that purpose.  There is no intention of using it for such a purpose.  The only reason that I saw any necessity for this section in the past was in the case of setting an institution aside for smallpox.  As Deputies are aware, for the last ten or 15 years there has been a remarkable decrease in fever cases, with the result that many fever hospitals were closed and nearly in all cases they were converted into sanatoria for tuberculosis cases.  We felt that we should have a certain number of centres marked off for the treatment of smallpox.  Smallpox has occurred in the neighbouring islands very frequently in the last ten or 12 years, but we have been lucky enough to escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> Should cases of smallpox occur here, it would be necessary to have some hospitals ready to isolate them.  Up to this, we have been in a position to get the local authorities to agree, although we found it very hard on a few occasions to get them to agree.  That is the only case where it is likely this power will be used.  Take the case of four or five counties.  We might ask one county to provide a smallpox hospital and have it available for any of the adjoining counties.  They might say: &ldquo;Why do they not provide one for themselves?&rdquo;  It would be uneconomic to have one in every county.  I think Deputies will see the difficulty of getting them to agree sometimes, although they have agreed so far.  In a case where we could not get agreement we may have to use the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking an extreme case.  I do not question what his intentions are, but it seems to me that this gives a rather extraordinary power to the Minister and to the Department.  Of course we must keep in the back of our minds always that the effective health authority in each county will be a person subject to the Minister and to the Department in these matters.  This new section says that the Minister may, by order made in respect of a specified health institution, direct that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in the institution and that institutional services of a specified class shall not be given in the institution.  It goes further and says that the Minister shall direct the type of person to whom treatment shall be given or shall not be given.  I do not think it is the intention, but it seems to me that this is a clause that could be open to very great abuse.  It is a very wide clause.  I do not think that in what the Minister has said so far he has made a case for getting such sweeping powers as are set out in this proposed new section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of public health alone a very strong case can be made for this new section.  In the last few years we had one example where such powers were necessary.  When Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health he had <Col N="850" /> a very long waiting list of T.B. cases and, apparently, there was more accommodation available in certain institutions throughout the country than was actually required in these areas and Deputy Dr. Browne persuaded those in charge of a number of institutions to provide accommodation on a temporary basis for T.B. patients. Similarly, there has been a great decline in the incidence of fevers, and it is quite possible that in future years there may be beds available in considerable numbers in fever hospitals which may be required for some other purpose and, unless the Minister had power to direct them, if he could not persuade the authorities in charge of these fever hospitals to take in certain cases, it would be a great disadvantage to the health of the community.  We can foresee a time when many of the beds now available for the treatment of T.B. may not be required for T.B. sufferers.  It might be very much in the interests of public health at that time if these could be used for cancer patients or whatever might happen to be the disease at that particular time which had a high mortality rate, and it is essential that the Minister for Health should have power to direct that the accommodation available should be used in the best interests of public health.</P>

      <P>Surely this new section deals with hospitals already under the control of the local authorities, such as county council hospitals.  I consider that the Minister has enough power already, and I do not know why he wants this special power delegated to him.  The Minister is really being given very considerable power under the new section to direct that institutional services of a specified class shall be given or shall not be given in an institution and that institutional services shall be given to a specified class of person or shall not be given to persons of a specified class.  Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has just stated that when Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health he required beds for T.B. cases.  That is quite true, but he did not need any special powers for that. There was no objection to his getting them.</P>

In other words, it is a case of further State control.  I consider it is quite unnecessary.  The only case the Minister made for it is in regard to cases of smallpox.

      <P>If an ordinary hospital run by a group of people is directed to take in persons suffering from a certain disease, and these people say: &ldquo;We do not like to take in patients suffering from that disease,&rdquo; is the Minister now taking power under this section to order them, whether they belong to a religious order or not, to take in persons suffering from that disease whom they do not want to take in? If that is so, it is coercion and I do not think we ought to do such a thing.  If the corporation wants to close down an institution catering for a certain type and they have nowhere to put them is the Minister going to say to a certain order, community or medical authority that they must take in, whether they are prepared or not, a person suffering from that certain type of disease about which I am talking?</P>

It only applies to the institutions under a health authority and no Order can be <Col N="852" /> made to deal with any other institution whatever.  I do not blame the Deputy for raising the matter because the Irish Medical Association, which should have known better, accused me in a leading article of trying to get the voluntary hospitals into this section.  That shows how far people can go to misrepresent me.  It must be clear that the section deals only with health authority institutions. Deputy Esmonde talked about the trend in regard to taking these powers.  There is no trend.  I am only re-enacting what is there already.  As I said before, there are many clauses in this Bill that are re-enacted from the Public Assistance Act, 1939 because all health services are being handed over from the public assistance authority to the health authority.  That is the reason why these clauses are re-enacted.</P>

If that is in operation it is certainly news to me and I would like to hear any other representative of a local authority on that matter.

I certainly object to giving any central authority the right to decide that institutional services of a specified class shall be given or shall not be given and that persons of a specified class shall be treated or shall not be treated.  If this Bill becomes law&mdash;I am not saying that the Minister will do this&mdash;it gives power to say that a person in Tipperary must be sent to Mayo or Donegal for treatment or a person from Wexford or Clare can be sent to any other part of the country that the Minister directs.  If the Minister so directs them, then the local authority, under this proposed new section, must carry out that direction. I am not suggesting for a moment that that is the Minister's intention.  We are not, as has been said here very often, legislating for the Minister's intentions. We are legislating for what may be done or what can be done.  It seems to me to be a very dangerous power to give any central authority, particularly when the driving force of the local authority will be a person who is in a large measure more responsible to the Minister and the central authority than to the local authority.</P>

      <P>The Opposition know quite well that there is in operation at the moment in each county district a certain type of institution.  You have a county hospital, district hospitals, sanatoria, fever hospitals.  Since 1922, when such institutions were set up, certain types of treatment were given in those particular institutions.  I think the section is quite obvious to anyone.  It is a section which, as far as I know, is fully in operation over very many years in regard to specified institutions and specified treatment.</P>

Deputy Morrissey wants to read into the section something that is not actually there and something that is not actually in operation.

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by Order, made in respect of a specified health institution, direct:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in the institution&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the Health Act, 1947, for a definition of what is included in the expression &ldquo;institutional services&rdquo;.  It includes &ldquo;(a) maintenance in an institution; (b) diagnosis, advice and treatment at an institution&rdquo;.  The Minister told us before progress was reported that there is nothing here which enables compulsion to be put on a medical officer to give any special treatment under the Acts.  Surely it is <Col N="855" /> here?  He may direct that certain institutional services are to be given in a particular institution and that includes diagnosis, advice and treatment at an institution.  It is well known that one of the objections taken by the Hierarchy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the health legislation was that it contained no safeguard that patients would not be obliged to accept treatment of different types&mdash;treatment in obstetrics, in gynaecology and in psychiatry&mdash;from people imbued with a materialistic philosophy or with opinions contrary to the natural law.  The Minister will recognise that phrase.</P>
      <P>On an earlier section we argued that, with certain limitations and always accepting that the safeguard was within the confines of this legislation, under the health provision for 1952 the patient appeared to be safeguarded but that the doctor was not.  Will the Minister tell me if it is not possible under his amendment for a Minister to direct a doctor to give treatment of a type that is contrary to that doctor's lawful conscience?  I think the Bill gives scope for that.  That was the point I was going to make, before the adjournment for tea, in answer to the Minister's claim.  It is here clear that a Minister may enjoin by regulation institutional services of a specified class and those include diagnosis, advice and treatment.</P>
      <P>Let me point out, with regard to people imbued with materialistic philosophy and with opinions contrary to the natural law, that a Minister imbued with these particular principles&mdash;I am not talking of the probability at the moment&mdash;could, under this Bill, compel doctors to give treatment which is contrary to their conscience and scruples and to do something against their conscience.  I believe that that point is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy McGilligan is a point in which Deputy McGilligan knows very well there is no substance.  It is just a usual <Col N="856" /> attempt to bedevil this whole matter. We heard him here earlier this evening talk about a letter that the Hierarchy are supposed to have written and now he has just spoken about what the Hierarchy have written.  I think it is most unfortunate that we have these references by Deputy McGilligan to a document that this House has never seen&mdash;a document that may or may not exist as far as this House is concerned. Deputy McGilligan uses it for what I consider to be an absolutely ulterior purpose which has nothing whatsoever to do with regard to the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan is very worried about what he terms &ldquo;a materialistic philosophy&rdquo; and the conception of a Minister in the future who might have views contrary to the natural law and who would direct a doctor to give a certain course of treatment which was contrary to that doctor's conscience. Deputy McGilligan knows that there is no substance at all in that argument. I am sure that he himself would certainly say that no direction given to him by anybody would make him act against his own conscience.  I do not know whether he would contend that he would act against his conscience even for money.  However, he does not mind suggesting that a doctor&mdash;a doctor in one of the health institutions of the country or a dispensary doctor&mdash;would act against his conscience just for the sake of maintaining his employment.</P>
      <P>I think that that is a slander on our doctors.  I have never yet met a doctor in this country who would do anything contrary to his conscience. I have not met many people even of Deputy McGilligan's profession who would act contrary to their own conscience. I cannot say why we should have this presumption on the part of Deputy McGilligan or anybody else that certain people would act contrary to their conscience just for the sake of maintaining their employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>One of the great protections of liberty that we have in this country is the fact that people will not act against their conscience <Col N="857" /> and that people will not be compelled to act against their conscience.  I see all over the country our dispensary medical officers and the doctors who are in our institutions, and I have the high opinion of these doctors that they will not act contrary to their conscience or contrary to their religion.  We have reached a very sorry pass when a Deputy of Deputy McGilligan's standing will suggest in this House that the doctors in our local institutions and our dispensary doctors will act contrary to their conscience on any directions from anybody. I think it is time we got rid of this bull&mdash;because that is all it is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is an amendment saying that the Minister may, by Order, direct certain things, &ldquo;and it specifies, in conclusion, &ldquo;and the health authority maintaining the institution shall comply with the direction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to avoid a position in which any Minister&mdash;any materialistic-minded Minister&mdash;might order doctors in health institutions to do certain things and put in law that the health authority shall comply with such directions. Such a provision is nonsensical in a country like this.  If an Order like that were made I think that the conscience of doctors would override it, even at the cost of whatever local popularity might be got out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may direct certain things.  The Minister for Health was not specially interested in the School Attendance Act which was passed here. That Act was taken to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court, on this <Col N="858" /> piece of legislation which enabled regulations to be made, gave as their judgment on the case that had been made to them, that a responsible Minister, acting with the full sense of his responsibility, would not be likely to make regulations that would be in breach of the Article of the Constitution which was alleged to be impugned by that Act, that it was still open and possible, under a phrase in the School Attendance Act, for a Minister to make regulations which would be in breach of the constitutional provision. That is all I put here.  It is quite open here for a Minister to demand that institutional services of a specialised class shall be given in institutions.  Once he does that&mdash;and this is by Order and not by regulation that comes before this House&mdash;then the health authority has to comply with it.</P>
    <P>There is no good in passing laws which can be taken to the Supreme Court and, on the analogy of the school attendance legislation, finding that there is room here and an opening for a person to contravene certain things. I am answering the point made before the tea adjournment.  The institutional service which may be directed includes diagnosis, advice and treatment in an institution.  I know that, notwithstanding what might be said about the conscience of the population or the resort that might be had to the good faith of the people of this country, the ordinary people in the country could not submit themselves to treatment that was contrary to their religious belief.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, the Hierarchy found themselves so concerned over this that they addressed the Minister to the point that the Bill had no safeguards that patients might not be compelled to submit themselves to obstetrical, gynaecological and psychiatric treatment which came from people imbued with materialistic principles or who held views contrary to the natural law.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say that, while the Hierarchy made their suggestions about patients and while the matter of patients has been safeguarded to a limited extent in the amendment brought into Section 4, when we raised <Col N="859" /> the position of the doctor, it was derided and it was put to us that there was no point arising under this legislation at which a doctor could be compelled to do anything that was in violation of his conscience.  I say that that point is here.  Why can we not have a bit of reason about this?  Does anybody here want to have a patient compelled to do something in violation of his conscience?  I take it the answer is no.  Does anybody here want to have a doctor compelled to do anything in violation of his conscience?  Again I take it the answer is no.  Why not say so?  It is very easy to say so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can screw a few votes here and there by any propaganda he can make, but he will not stop me making my statement on this amendment.  The amendment does allow the Minister to impose certain treatment in an institution. How is the treatment to be carried out?  Surely by the officers of the institution or by the Minister's officers. Is that not what we were objecting to before the adjournment of the debate earlier, that, while there is in a limited way a protection on the ground of the teaching of religion&mdash;but, as we would prefer it, on the ground of violation of conscience&mdash;it does not protect the doctor?  The Minister told us that there was no necessity to protect him, that he could not order a doctor to do anything.  Let me make a distinction. I am not saying he will.  Could he? Surely it is clear that he could, and that was the point on which the Supreme Court ruled against the School Attendance Act, that even assuming that the Minister would be responsible, sections in that Act still left it open for some other Minister to impose certain conditions that were contrary to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I say the same with regard to this and I object therefore to giving the Minister this power.  If he likes to say that he has it in some other Act&mdash; very good let him have it.  One of these days we will get a proper objection on moral grounds, on the ground of the natural law, against this particular legislation.  Let it not be forgotten that any of these other pieces of legislation which contain these compulsory treatment provisions are all subject to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution in one Article says that freedom of conscience is guaranteed. It is, of course, guaranteed, subject to certain things, one of which is public order and the other morality, but it is not this Dáil which is the adjudicator in that regard.  In the Sinn <Col N="863" /> Fein Funds case, the courts took the strong step of saying&mdash;and a proper step it was&mdash;that they would be the guardians of such things as the exigencies of the common good, and so on, and they will establish themselves as the people who will make the standards of public order and morality.</P>
    <P>If there is in this or any of the other legislation anything that allows institutional treatment against infectious diseases, in regard to vaccination or anything else, it is all subject to the freedom of conscience guaranteed in the Article about religion.  That freedom is guaranteed subject only to two things, public order and morality, and the arbiters of these are not the group of people meeting here, but the courts, and they have already established standards contrary to the standards accepted here with regard to private property.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a)  the Minister may by Order make such provisions as appear to him to be necessary and proper in relation to matters incidental to or consequent on the discontinuance,</P>
      <P>(b)  the Minister, if he so thinks proper, may by Order direct the authority to provide and maintain at a specified place an institution of a specified character or size in substitution for the discontinued institution or Department.</P>
      <P>(5)  A health authority shall comply with every Order made in relation to them under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt at all that this particular amendment is desirable and is necessary.  I agree with Deputy Cowan; I do not think any medical officers who will be employed under health services in the future are likely to carry out any procedures for money which would be likely to conflict with their consciences.</P>
      <P>I do not think they would be asked to do so by any Government or any Minister that we can anticipate.  Is it not a fact that if such powers are ever sought by any Government or required by any Government they will be taken by that Government, because they will be able to do so by virtue of a majority in this House?  Consequently, I would suggest this hysterical mirage of Deputy McGilligan's is merely another attempt to confuse the issues.  Fine Gael are merely obstructing the attempt of the Minister to introduce a Health Bill, and the instrument which proved so valuable to a limited degree on the last occasion on which they obstructed progressive health legislation, is being whisked out again.</P>

      <P>May I just say one word about Deputy Browne.  He is an expert on mirages and I have always recognised that as an obsession with him.  It has been argued now that no doctor will do for money something beyond the bounds of his lawful preference. The same argument could have been made to the Hierarchy that no patient would take advantage or avail of services or submit to any treatment that was contrary to or in violation of his convictions.  The Hierarchy still objected.  The Hierarchy's objection was that the Bill contained no safeguards that the patient would not be obliged to undergo treatment against his conscience.  There is certainly no lack of appreciation on the part of the Hierarchy in regard to the stability of the Irish character particularly in regard to religious matters; nevertheless they regarded it as wrong that a piece of legislation should go through containing no safeguards for patients, whose lawful scruples might be violated if they were compelled to undergo treatment of a particular type. It was no answer to say: &ldquo;You can rely on the good faith, on the scruples and on the strength of the religious feeling of your community&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I turn this argument to a doctor we are told: &ldquo;Of course, the doctors are strong with regard to their religion.  They will never do this.&rdquo; Are we going to pass in this House legislation which gives some Minister&mdash; perhaps some materialistic Minister not upholding the principles of natural law&mdash;the right to say to a lot of Catholic doctors: &ldquo;You will do that or leave,&rdquo; and forcing on them a new type of martyrdom?  I want to object to legislation proceeding from this House having any such possibility even though it be a bare possibility.  When I argue about that possibility being removed I have regard to the objection of the Hierarchy that there was no safeguard in regard to the patient against being compelled to accept treatment of the obstetric, gynaecological or psychiatric type proceeding from people with materialistic principles or people who do not accept the true view in regard to the natural law. If that is true in regard to the patient <Col N="866" /> why should we not have the same position in regard to the doctors?  That is the only point I want to make, but I want to make the case more particularly because the Minister said there was nothing in this legislation originally introduced or amended which gave anybody the power of compelling a doctor to act in violation of his conscience.</P>
    <P>I assume nobody wants to ask doctors to act in violation of their conscience.  What is the difficulty in saying so?  We have apparently the same view with regard to patients in this Irish community that they would not accept treatment in violation of their conscience; yet we have a safeguard. What is shameful in accepting a safeguard in regard to the doctor?  I think it is wrong to leave the power there however remote the possibility of enforcing it may be.  We in this House agree that if a Minister did try to enforce it, the doctor would be entitled to fight against it and to refuse to give treatment.  What is wrong in saying so?  I am sure the Minister has made the same excuse to the Hierarchy with regard to the patient; nevertheless he has brought in an amendment saying that a patient may seek to avail of a service and yet may object to a particular treatment if that particular treatment is against the teaching of his religion.  Surely the same ought to be said in regard to everybody connected with this&mdash;patients, doctors, nurses and anybody else in the service of the health authority.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that Deputy McGilligan appears to overlook the fact that he has an advantage, certainly over myself, in that I have not read the letter addressed to the faithful&mdash;presumably he is more faithful than others.  I have not read that letter and in consequence I am not in a position to say&mdash;perhaps Deputy McGilligan would let us know&mdash;whether the Hierarchy asked for guarantees in relation to the protection of doctors in the administration or the running of these schemes; and if they did not, whether Deputy McGilligan feels that they have been in any way remiss in not advising the Minister that he <Col N="867" /> should introduce such guarantees. Also, if these guarantees were asked for in relation to the doctor, should we stop there?  Surely the nurses, the attendants, the laboratory technicians, the radiographers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention again to a certain matter. Both, before you came in, a Cheann Comhairle, and since you came in, Deputy McGilligan has been referring to a letter which was addressed to the faithful by the Hierarchy.  Such a letter is not before this House.  It is not on the records of the House.  It certainly was not published for the information of the faithful and no person that I know of has an official copy of any such document.  According to Deputy McGilligan the document was issued and stopped.  If people, particularly the Irish Hierarchy, issue a document and stop it they stop it for a good purpose.  I am sure they did not want or do not want Deputy McGilligan to quote in this House from a document which they stopped and did not publish or circulate to the faithful as he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I described Deputy McGilligan's conduct in his approach to this matter as being filthy conduct.  I think it is filthy, I think it is despicable, I think it is reprehensible and I think Deputy McGilligan should be ashamed of himself for using this House for the purpose of getting in, by the method he has adopted, a reference to a document which, as far as the Irish people are concerned, does not exist.  Then we have his further suggestion that the Taoiseach crossed the Border to prevent publication of this document.  I <Col N="868" /> say a suggestion of that kind is filthy and reprehensible.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan was asked the question, is there anything in this particular document against the amendment before the House at the moment?  Deputy McGilligan has been asked several times to quote, if he would, from the particular document.  I think, and I submit to you Sir, that we cannot discuss this in a reasonable manner if one Deputy can come forward and say: &ldquo;I have a document addressed to the faithful; I have seen it and there are certain things in it to this effect.&rdquo; That document is not before this House and I submit that there should be no reference to that particular document permitted in this debate because nobody knows anything about this document. I do not think Deputy McGilligan will say that I am wrong when I say it was not circulated to the faithful.  It was not published to the faithful and nobody knows anything about it.  When I hear Deputy McGilligan using the document in the way he has been using it, I am reminded of the soldier mentioned in one of Goldsmith's Citizen of the World <Col N="870" /> Letters&mdash;the citizen or the soldier with the foul tongue and the foul language who was so worried about religion, if the French invaded Britain.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer for a few moments to the question of institutional treatment.  Deputy Dr. Browne said that we would get to the stage where the hall porter could be held responsible for a hospital. Deputy Dr. Browne should know perfectly well as a doctor that the medical officer is in charge of the treatment in a hospital.  It has been clearly stated that one of the powers that the Minister is getting under this section has reference to advice in regard to the treatment in an institution. If we pass this legislation, we hand over control of treatment in a hospital, in theory anyway, to the Minister.  The person responsible for a hospital is the medical officer but if you pass legislation such as this, <i>ipso facto</i> you remove power from the medical officer and delegate it to the Minister.  I am not suggesting, and I do not think that any Deputy here would suggest, that the present Government are going to interfere in a materialistic way with the hospitals but we are asking the House to pass very dangerous legislation.  In other words, we are delegating to the Minister absolute control of patients that are treated in our health authority institutions and the treatment they are to receive.  We are also giving him power to say who is to be admitted to the hospitals and who is not.  That is what the Fine Gael Party maintains is wrong and we do not accept this in any degree whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated before the adjournment that it could not be pointed out that any doctor could be made to give a treatment that he did not think proper himself.  I hold the position is still the same as far as this section is concerned.  I had to draw the attention of the House to Deputy Costello's interpretation of some laws already.  Deputy McGilligan has adopted the same tactics here of presuming to interpret the law and of not doing it in an honest way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talks about institutional services to a specified class and institutional <Col N="871" /> services, he says, include treatment. He then goes further and argues that the doctor may be asked to carry out the treatment of a specified class.  Anybody who reads this definition will see that that is absolutely ridiculous and absolutely absurd.  It says &ldquo;diagnosis, advice and treatment at an institution&rdquo;. Does Deputy McGilligan really mean to put before the House that an order could be given to a doctor to carry out diagnosis of a specified class? After all, one cannot specify the class for treatment without taking the whole sentence surely.  Diagnosis of a specified class is, of course, absurd and Deputy McGilligan knows it is absurd. I object to Deputies on the Opposition Benches who have some reputation as far as the law goes coming in here with that reputation and interpreting the law for the House, and interpreting it, let me say, in a very dishonest way. As far as I am concerned I am quite satisfied&mdash;I am not a trained lawyer; perhaps I should be proud of that when I see what goes on here&mdash;that no Minister could direct the doctor in an institution to give treatment to a specified class.  Anyhow, that is a queer expression&mdash;a specified class of treatment.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for saving me the trouble of reading the section.  I will now put the Minister's amendment alongside it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by Order made in respect of a specified health institution...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, in respect of an institution under a local authority&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;direct&mdash;</P>

      <P>and the health authority maintaining the institution shall comply with the direction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, which he has just read out, is the same as the amendment he has now put in.  That is exactly what disturbs me in this matter.  We talk about morality.  I think there is a certain question of morality involved in the Minister being honest in relation to the things he tells the House.  In the first place, the amendment the Minister has put in is entirely different; there is a much <Col N="874" /> more comprehensive control under this amendment than there is in Section 36. All that is here is that where district institutions exist under a local authority for a particular purpose and where in some of them only particular cases can be dealt with the Minister can prevent patients being dealt with in other institutions.  Compare now the restricted proposals in relation to institutions that already exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must exist before I do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the approach and purpose of Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, is entirely different from the proposals here.  When we add to that deception the Minister's explanation that this thing was never very much done before, and that the only thing that it probably was useful for was in exceptional cases, such as a smallpox outbreak, we find ourselves faced with a rather extraordinary situation. If an outbreak of smallpox should occur, under the Public Assistance Act patients suffering from that disease would only be allowed into a certain institution.  Patients in neighbouring counties would not be allowed into their own institutions.  They would have to be sent to this special institution.</P>
      <P>What is the kind of presentation that we get of this particular amendment? Following on the Minister's smallpox idea we get Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll dealing with the development of tuberculosis institutions during the inter-Party régime when, by persuasion, it was possible for the then Minister for Health to have all the necessary institutions he wanted to serve his purpose in dealing with tuberculosis.  It was persuasion that did that without any ministerial Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have the heavy hand of the Minister coming in and nothing will do him but to be able to do by Order all the things specified in (a), (b), (c) and (d).  Knowing the kind of discussion we have had on paragraph (a) one wonders what will be disclosed when discussion takes place on paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).  The Minister complains <Col N="875" /> of the interpretation of the law not being honest.  What adjective can be applied to the presentation by the Minister of his amendment?  We are told by Deputies supporting the Minister that we are held in certain blinkers.  The purpose of this Bill seems to be concealed behind some queer kind of curtain&mdash;a curtain of iron or a curtain of brass.  I do not know what kind of curtain it is.  It seems to be some deliberately developed fog. The Minister tells us that this amendment is similar to provisions that operated heretofore.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>He told us that what operated before was hardly wanted at all in the last ten years&mdash;except that it might be wanted for smallpox&mdash;and, apparently, that is a very queer contention and cannot be an honest presentation of what this amendment is meant to be.  Either the Minister does not know what the amendment is about or he is deliberately hiding what the amendment is for.  What we want to know is who on earth is behind this if the Minister is not and, if the Minister is behind it, he ought to tell the House the real purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>An article that appeared in the quarterly publication, <i>Studies</i>, in speaking with some favour of the 1952 legislation, said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tumult and the shouting have died away, and the captains and the kings have silently or not so silently departed, and we are left with a Bill modestly entitled, &lsquo;An Act to amend and extend the Health Act, 1947, and certain other enactments&rsquo;. Gone is the first White Paper and its gorgeous retinue of illustrated pamphlets and half-page advertisements; gone are the hopes or fears of &lsquo;free-for-all&rsquo;&lsquo;paid-for-by-nobody&rsquo; health services; gone even is a certain amount of the second White Paper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on to comment favourably on the 1952 proposals:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Right in the forefront of the Bill is an ample disclaimer in clear language touching the very first caveat of the Bishops in their letter <Col N="876" /> of 10th October, 1950.  &lsquo;In their opinion,&rsquo; said the letter, &lsquo;the powers taken by the State in the proposed mother-and-child health service are in direct opposition to the rights of the family and of the individual and are liable to very great abuse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the phrase I want to found on&mdash;&ldquo;the powers are liable to very great abuse&rdquo;.  I do not think the Hierarchy ever put up the contention that they feared any great abuse immediately. They said it was liable to great abuse and that was the main foundation of their argument against the immoral proposals of 1947, arriving at the somewhat amoral proposals of 1952.</P>
    <P>According to this article, the letter from the Hierarchy in 1950 continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Their character is such that no assurance that they would be used in moderation could justify their enactment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This article continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new Bill meets this caveat in two ways: (1) it repeals every single section (21 to 28) lock, stock and barrel, of Part III of the Health Act, 1947, on which part the whole of the first White Paper's mother-and-child scheme was based, and from which it was to draw its legal force: and (ii) it declares, in Section 4:&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they refer to Section 4, in the terms in which we had it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided or to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to health examination or treatment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the comment continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only addition one would like would be &lsquo;in this or any other Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill was presented and passed its Second Reading here and the Hierarchy then addressed a letter to the Faithful, which amounted to a condemnation of the proposals on the ground that they were contrary to Catholic social teaching.  The Minister told us he would endeavour to meet <Col N="877" /> those points of view and one of his endeavours was by bringing in the first amendment, which was to Section 4.</P>
    <P>When we began to discuss Section 4 from this side, there was introduced the question of the doctor.  The new Section 4, with the additional second sub-section, to some extent, but with great limitations, would meet the objection made by the Hierarchy with regard to the patient.  In that connection, we raised whether the doctor's position ought to be safeguarded and the Minister's answer was that the doctor's position was in no way interfered with by anything in this legislation. At that time he was making the argument that the only amelioration he wanted was in this legislation, that is, in the 1952 proposals.  He balanced that by saying that in this legislation there is nothing which enables the Minister to impose any compulsion on a doctor.</P>
    <P>I had asked the Minister if it was the case that certain sections did.  I referred to the difficulty a Deputy had in making his way through the original health proposals and the 32 amendments. Now here it arises immediately on this amendment No. 3.  We are to insert a new section enabling the Minister, by an Order made in respect of a specified institution, to direct that institutional services for a specialised class should be given in the institution.</P>
    <P>I turn to the 1947 Act to find out the definition of institutional services. It includes &ldquo;diagnosis, advice and treatment at an institution.&rdquo;  The Minister has made an attempt at replying to me on the basis of diagnosis&mdash;can he prescribe a diagnosis? I never said he could, but does the Minister mean that because he cannot prescribe a diagnosis he cannot prescribe the advice or the treatment?  I say those arguments do not hang together.  He is here entitled to direct institutional services.  I ask him to take these things separately, one by one.  He can prescribe diagnosis&mdash;he will not prescribe it, I hope.  He will not prescribe treatment.  We know he already did.  The Department of Health, through their Minister at various times, did try to prescribe certain treatment from headquarters.</P>

      <P>Let us have our own records put together.  I will not object to that test.  We have here that the Minister may prescribe this treatment. I say you can get from this phrase, this definition section of the 1947 Act, and this amendment, that it is possible for the Minister, by Order, to direct that certain treatment be given in a particular institution.  I assert that it is not possible to argue against that as a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's whole answer to me is: &ldquo;Can you conceive a Minister prescribing treatment that would be contrary to or a violation of the conscience of the mass of the people?&rdquo;  I want to ask him a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must have met the Hierarchy on their objections to his legislation and when they objected to his legislation, to Section 4, and thought that it required further amendment, surely he must have had the same answer as he has given in this House to me.  He must have said: &ldquo;Can your Lordships feel that any Minister would prescribe <Col N="880" /> or would compel a patient to undergo treatment that was contrary to the teaching of the Church?&rdquo;  Yet the Minister has been, somewhere or another, coerced to bring in an amendment making this part of the legislation. Why did he do that?  The Hierarchy did object.  They said there was no safeguard.  That was all they advanced, that there was no safeguard that patients would not be compelled to accept treatment in either obstetrics, gynaecology or psychiatry, contrary to their own views.  They put it in the terms of a phrase, people who were imbued with materialistic principles or who had views contrary to the natural law.</P>
    <P>Let me transfer that argument to the doctor.  Supposing the Hierarchy's objection were made that there is no safeguard that doctors would not be compelled to administer treatment in obstetrics, gynaecology or psychiatry, directed by people who were imbued with materialistic principles or who were advocating practices contrary to the natural law.  Two of the things we know there was objection to were abortion and birth control.</P>
    <P>They were two of the special points that were made in the letter.  If the Minister feels that there was a strong objection that no representative of any Government likely to be formed in this country for a generation or two would be likely to tell patients they must submit to treatment dealing with birth control or leading towards birth control or tending towards abortive practices, he could certainly say that with regard to the doctor; but his argument apparently did not pass muster with those who were addressing the faithful over his head on the ground that his legislation was contrary to Catholic social teaching, and who made it as one of their points that patients had no safeguard against their being made to give into treatment given by people with those viewpoints. If the argument was good with regard to the doctor, it is good with regard to the patient.  The Minister has given in with regard to the patient.  All I say to him is that the House is apparently in agreement that they do not want to have anything <Col N="881" /> in their legislation which would have even the remotest possibility of compulsion in the case of patient or doctor, the one to accept or the other to give, treatment of a type condemned by the social teachings of a particular Church.  Why does the Minister not accept that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary.  I am not going to accept my law from Deputy McGilligan.  I would be very foolish if I did.  The Deputy is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  I thought the Minister could comfortably carry through the legislation we had here on the Second Reading and in answers he said there was nothing wrong.  Yet he has produced an amendment which appears to accept the contention that there was something wrong and that wrong was phrased in these terms, that there was no safeguard against the patients being compelled to accept certain treatment.  I ask the Minister, and I do not think he can answer me. He certainly cannot deny me when I say there is no safeguard against this, in the case of a doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you compel a doctor to give certain treatment?  Can the Minister, by Order, not prescribe that certain services shall be given by the institution, and the health authority must comply with that direction? That direction covers advice and treatment. Suppose the possibility is the most remote thing on the face of the earth.  The Minister is safeguarding against this, also remote, in respect to <Col N="882" /> the patient.  Why could he not satisfy scruples and deal with it in respect of the doctor also?</P>
      <P>I have been asked whether it is the Hierarchy have taken this objection. I think they have, of course, taken it. In a letter of the 5th April, 1951, they spoke in the following terms.  They expressed once again:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approval of a sane and legitimate health service which will properly safeguard the health of mothers and children.  The Hierarchy cannot approve of any scheme which, in its general tendency, must foster undue control by the State in a sphere so delicate and so intimately concerned with morals as that which deals with gynaecology or obstetrics and with the relation between doctor and patient.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that covers this point.  If it does not, quite a number of phrases have been used later.  The Hierarchy were, as the Minister knows, very definitely concerned with what they called anything that unduly interfered with the rights of the various people mentioned. Amongst the others was the medical profession.</P>
      <P>They went on to speak of birth control and abortion in so-called health clinics and they said that health education often involves the claim to direct the child according to pernicious Freudian and materialistic principles.</P>

      <P>The result was objection because it extended considerably the already wide field of medical service now covered by the State.  I understand there was objection to the setting up of a centralised bureaucratic system in a matter of most intimate concern, health and life.  There was a statement that the public health authority which would administer the service was not an independent local body but was an official entirely subordinate to the Minister.  I understood there was further objection that the Minister was given power, and extremely wide power to make regulations for every detail of the service, so that he could in time seriously modify the intimate doctor-patient relationship.  If that is not the objection to this, to the Minister being able by Order to prescribe certain treatment which a health authority will have to comply with, I do not understand the meaning of the English that is in this reference I have taken from the document that apparently no one but myself knows anything about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a piece of advice as to how to construe a statute. I am going to give the Minister and the House the benefit of that advice because, of course, if I said it, the Minister would not believe it, but it happens to be the advice of a person who was appointed to the Irish Bench by the present Government, so his advice may be taken.  That advice is that when you have a phrase used in a <Col N="885" /> section of an Act of Parliament which is defined by a definition section in that Act or associated Acts then, in order to see what the section means, take out the phrase and write in the definition and then you know where you are.  I am going to do that.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of the new proposed sub-section (3) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by Order, made in respect of a specified health institution, direct&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in the institution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;institutional services&rdquo; of course are defined in Section 2 of the Health Act, 1947.  I take out those words from this line and put in the definition as given in the Act of 1947 and the proposed amendment reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that (a) maintenance in an institution,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(b) diagnosis, advice and treatment at an institution,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(c) appliances and medicines and other preparations,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(d) the use of special apparatus at an institution.</P>
      <P>of a specified class shall be given in the institution.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;And the health authority maintaining the institution shall comply with the direction.&rdquo; Taking that method of interpreting the section, the Minister's suggestion, &ldquo;he cannot, so he cannot&rdquo;, appears as foolish as the method by which he purported to meet Deputy McGilligan's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a specific question of Deputy McGilligan.  I do not know if he replied to me but I accepted that he gave me the reply that the Hierarchy referred in general terms to the problems of the doctor.  Well, I <Col N="886" /> think, in general terms the Minister has met the objections of the Hierarchy.  There is no request, as far as I am aware, from the Hierarchy to include specifically the different catagories of personnel who are involved in the carrying out of an operation.  I do not agree with the view of Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  I think the responsibility for doing an immoral act in relation to an operation could extend beyond the doctor.  As I have protested on many occasions since this debate began, I am not an authority on the moral law but I would imagine that anybody taking part in the operation, which, as Deputy Esmonde knows, is a fairly complicated thing, involving more than the surgeon, could become involved in the carrying out of an immoral act and consequently would have to be specified by the Minister if he were to cover all the contingencies of inflicting an injury on the conscience of anybody taking part in that act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also referred to the question of birth control and legal abortion in the 1951 health scheme. The inclusion in the criticism of references to these two practices which are contrary to the natural law implied that the criticism referred to the possible inclusion or the inclusion of a provision in that Bill for the carrying out of instruction in relation to either birth control or that the doctor should carry out legal abortions or anything leading up to abortion.  I think the Deputy has been very hard on the Minister, particularly censorious on the Minister.  I would suggest that the eloquence which we have listened to for some hours from Deputy McGilligan would have been most useful and most valuable to us all if we, jointly, Deputy McGilligan and I, considering the provisions of the amending Health Bill, or the provisions of the mother-and-child scheme which he now attempts to smear with the suggestion that it contained provisions for these objectionable practices remembered that it was equally, with me, Deputy McGilligan's Health Bill or health provisions or health scheme and, that if it contained anything relating to legal abortion, contraception, euthanasia or any of these frightful propositions which have <Col N="887" /> been whispered underground or sometimes overground by the Deputy McGilligans of the Fine Gael Party, he must accept full responsibility for those provisions if they were included, but, of course, everybody knows they were not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just waiting for a ruling of the Chair about disorderly language.  I want to make a reference to this document.  I have been asked whether the 1947 Act met with my approval.  It did not meet with my approval at any time.  Sections 21 to 28 were the ones to which we directed our Attorney-General's attention, and he ruled that two of them were distinctly unconstitutional and that regulations made under most of the others would certainly advance the matter to being a breach of the Constitution. We ordered these sections to be removed.  These are the sections to which the Hierarchy mainly took exception. I understand at that stage that they spoke of the power of the <Col N="894" /> public health authorities to treat all the illnesses and defects of children and stated that they were neglecting the pre-existing rights of the parents and of the families, particularly the parents.  They spoke of the power to deal with women in respect of the gynaecological and other kinds of treatment and stated that the Catholic view with regard to sex relations was opposed by people in many countries and that these people were making provision for birth control, abortion and so on.  On these grounds they were desperately afraid in regard to Sections 21 to 28 of the Act of 1947. They spoke of the claim made to direct the child according to materialistic principles.</P>
      <P>Having stated their view of Sections 21 to 28, they went on to say that there was no safeguard provided with regard to Catholic mothers, no respect for the rights of parents, no provision that children and mothers would have to be treated in accordance with Catholic principles.  They welcomed the fact that these sections had disappeared.  I welcomed the fact that they had disappeared as I always objected to them, at any rate on constitutional grounds.  We had discovered when in office that the Archbishop of Dublin had written a letter objecting to these things, not on constitutional grounds, but on moral grounds.  These two matters were before the Cabinet to which I belonged and we presevered in that objection all the time.</P>
      <P>The position we were in with regard to health legislation was that there never was any health legislation in the offing.  There was never any scheme. There was a certain amount of what the Hierarchy called vague promises of a general type, but no detailed information as to their implementation or any principles by which the implementation could be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not you give me £500,000 for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I do not know anything about it.  Money was provided under the health services for making grants to the health authorities, and it was all used.  The fact <Col N="895" /> that it was all used makes it quite clear that there was no scheme.  It could not be used under the 1947 Act because there were no regulations made under the 1947 Act in relation to mothers and children.  There is the old red ticket business and all that. Money was provided for it.  If the Minister wants to find out why certain moneys were provided he will find that recorded in a minute where the officials of the Department of Health came to discuss matters with the officials of the Department of Finance and put up the contention that whatever sum was carried into the Estimate could not be cut down, otherwise the doctors would be able to say that they had beaten the Minister for Health. I understood that the money would be spent for health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the amendment. Deputy Costello put very forcibly what I tried to put in my own limited way&mdash; that where there is power taken by Order to direct certain institutional services which the health authority must comply with, and that includes the provision of advice and treatment at an institution, it is possible under that for an Order to be given directing treatment of a type contrary to the principles which the Hierarchy have attempted to make clear to the faithful and which they have made clear to the Government.  The Minister would be better advised to accept an enlargement of the first amendment and to provide not merely for patients but for the medicos who are going to comply with the directions.  If I again have to meet the argument that people cannot accept, that people will do anything contrary to their conscience, then, if we accept that, we need not have either Section 4 or the first amendment brought in by the Minister because the same argument will apply. Patients in this religious community would not for one moment submit to any treatment contrary to the teachings of their religion.  If that is an argument in regard to the doctor&mdash;and it is a sound argument&mdash;it is apparently not a good argument with regard to the patient.  The same reasoning ought to lead the Minister to bring in <Col N="896" /> a safeguard with regard to the doctor who is going to be made enforce these regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I marvel at the arrogant suggestion of Deputy McGilligan that he did not give authority and did not take part in authorising me, as Minister for Health, to undertake to carry out the details for the implementation of a mother-and-child scheme. Section 21 of the Health Act, 1947, provided:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations made under Section 28 of this Act, make arrangements for safeguarding the health of women in respect of motherhood and for their education in that respect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 22 provided:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations made under Section 28 of this Act, do, in respect of children in their functional area who are not pupils of any school, the following things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Act then goes on to detail, under the headings (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), full treatment for children up to 16 years of age.  All the documents in relation to the decision and the direction put by me and submitted by me, as Minister for Health, to the Cabinet were read by Deputy McGilligan presumably. In the light of those circumstances he was to make his decision. He finally did make his decision.  The most important document of all&mdash;that which contained the direction to me to bring in a free no means test mother-and-child scheme up to the age of 16 years&mdash;and all the other documents are there.  It is not a recollection of mine. The documents are extant and available and can be verified by this House or a Committee of this House if such a Committee wishes to go into the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I marvel at Deputy McGilligan's incredible brass-bound impudence in standing up to suggest that this very expensive and elaborate scheme, advertised fully and spoken about repeatedly by me as one of his colleagues, was considered without his <Col N="897" /> knowledge and that he was ignorant of these details and these facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>By Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan suggested that none of us are likely to carry out anything in conflict with the dictates of our conscience.  From listening to Deputy McGilligan, it is quite obvious that he, as a member of the then Government, readily condoned the carrying out of something by one of his colleagues which was, as we hear to-night, in most flagrant conflict with the dictates of his conscience and his view of what was ethical, moral and socially acceptable and desirable.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan suggests that he was not aware of the scheme or of the details of the scheme. Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach, with Deputy Norton negotiated with the Irish Medical Association who were most vehemently aware of the details and objected to the details of the scheme.  Deputy Costello, Deputy Norton, Deputy McGilligan and my former colleagues negotiated on the details of this scheme with the Irish Medical Association.  Surely they did not negotiate in connection with a mirage or with the vague outline of a plan as suggested by Deputy McGilligan?  Surely they had something to discuss and to argue with the Irish Medical Association&mdash;something which Deputies Costello and Norton were fully and clearly aware of?  We all know that Deputy McGilligan must also have been clear about it.  There can be no suggestion that Deputy McGilligan did not play a full and most important part in laying down the underlying principles on which the then mother and child scheme was founded based on Section 1 and 22 of the 1947 Health Act.  As I said before, all the documents in that case are extant and are available.  If a Committee of this House is set up to investigate the whole matter I shall be delighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Deputy McGilligan suggested there was the vague outline of a plan for which he gave me&mdash;not very willingly, I admit&mdash;the sum of £600,000 but only a tiny part of this vast sum was given by the Minister for Finance <Col N="898" /> to his colleague, the Minister for Health, to carry out, to implement a scheme, the principles of which had been considered on documents submitted by me.  Having been considered&mdash; in spite of all the conscientious objections which Deputy McGilligan now throws out so profusely and so readily &mdash;it was agreed to by Deputy McGilligan and I was directed to carry on with the scheme.</P>
    <P>The £600,000 that appears in a footnote to the Estimates for that year is there because those were Deputy McGilligan's Estimates for the year in respect of which it was decided by the inter-Party Government that the books should be faked to the tune of approximately £4,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the sum could only be kept within limits by refusing to put forward the full sums required by each Department.  I refused to connive at that conspiracy to defraud the public and I accepted the device of letting the public know &mdash;as far as I was concerned, at any rate&mdash;by means of a footnote that £600,000 would be required for a mother and child scheme.  Conscientious objections.  Morality.  The moral law.  Ethics.  All these words without meaning&mdash;certainly words without any intention of practice, in my experience of the man sitting on those benches, a man who was so well described by the Minister in the two very fitting words which are, I understand, unparliamentary and which I cannot, therefore, repeat.</P>

If Deputy Dr. Browne did not want to get all his own way in defiance of those who were competent to deal with the question of the moral law in relation to his proposals, in defiance of the entire medical profession in this country&mdash;his own professional colleagues&mdash;and in defiance of every one of his own colleagues in the Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having got back into history, I want to be allowed to clarify certain points.  Deputy Dr. Browne is trying to reinstate himself in public opinion by having it appear that he had a scheme, a scheme which had been approved.  He has not to-day gone the length of saying what he said to his colleagues in March, 1951, that he believed the scheme had the goodwill of the Hierarchy.  He has not said that to-night, but he did say it in March, 1951.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He addressed the Taoiseach on 19th March, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Am I correct in thinking from the terms of your letter of March 15th, that you are under the impression that the Hierarchy are opposed to the mother and child health protection scheme?  May I point out <Col N="904" /> that this impression, if held by you, is certainly not borne out by the following facts?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy was labouring under the obsession that his scheme was not objected to by the Hierarchy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>After the October meeting, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was 19th March, 1951, and that is what he said to his colleagues: &ldquo;Am I correct in thinking that you are under the impression that the Hierarchy are opposed to the mother and child scheme?&rdquo;  He got a reply from Deputy Costello on 21st March in which the then Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If in the letter delivered to the Government, the Hierarchy continued to speak of the dangers inherent in the proposals one cannot easily understand your opinion that you had completely satisfied the Archbishop of Dublin and the Bishops of Galway and Ferns concerning the removal of these dangers.  On the contrary, the Government has received no assurance whatever from the Hierarchy as to its confidence in the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the next page of the letter addressed to the Deputy, the then Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I have already indicated, I am at a loss to understand how you could feel satisfied that you had at your interview on 11th October last with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin and their Lordships of Galway and Ferns satisfactorily disposed of their objections.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy had that obsession at the time.  The then Taoiseach's letter concludes by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That you are seriously in error in thinking that you had satisfied His Grace and their Lordships at your interview is amply borne out by the letter of 8th March to you from His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin when he specifically stated, in the passages quoted in my recent letter to you, that on the occasion of your interview he stated that he could not approve of the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> At the end of the letter of 19th March, addressed by Deputy Browne, then Minister, to my Leader, the Taoiseach, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would be interested to know whether your withholding of approval to the mother and child scheme is due either to the supposed opposition of the Hierarchy to the scheme or to the possible opposition of any individual member of the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy presents the position to the House that the scheme was approved. How did he come to write to Deputy Costello on 19th March: &ldquo;I would be interested to know whether your withholding of approval to the mother and child scheme...&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In your good time. On 19th March, 1951, the Deputy was under the impression that the mother and child scheme had not received the approval of the Cabinet.  To-night he says it had.  With regard to whether there was a scheme at all or not, I know from my own information what the situation was.  Here is the way it affected outsiders, the Hierarchy.  In a letter of 5th April, addressed from Archbishop's House to Deputy Costello, there appears:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is to be noted that the proposed scheme fails to give clear evidence of the details of implementation. The scheme, as set forth in vague, general terms, has the appearance of conferring a benefit on the mothers and children of the whole nation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then follows quite a lot of criticism. It was supposed to be a scheme that was fully implemented.</P>

I want to go back a year or two.  In 1948&mdash;and the records are again in the hands of the Department; if necessary I could produce copies&mdash;the Attorney General then serving us, when he was asked to rule upon Sections 21 to 28, ruled all those sections to be unconstitutional and that, as far as others were concerned, while it might be said there was nothing immediately making them a breach of the Constitution there was no doubt that regulations under them could reasonably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the question I was asked earlier.  It was addressed to various Departments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am to inform you that following consideration of a letter dated 5th April, 1951, to the Taoiseach from His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, Primate of Ireland, on behalf of the Catholic Hierarchy of Ireland, intimating that the particular scheme for a mother and child health service proposed by the Minister for Health is opposed to Catholic social teaching, the Government decided, at a meeting held on the 6th instant,</P>
      <P>(1) That the scheme referred to should not be further pursued&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It had already been not approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) that, in the light of the Government's conviction that mothers and children should not be deprived of the best available health care by reason of insufficient means, a scheme or schemes for mother and child health service should, as soon as possible, be prepared and undertaken which would (a) provide the best modern facilities for those whose family wage or income does not permit them to obtain, of themselves, the health care that is necessary for mothers and children and (b) be in <Col N="912" /> conformity with Catholic social teaching, and</P>
    <P>(3) that consideration should be given to the question whether any amendments of the Health Act, 1947, additional to those proposed in the Health Bill, 1950, are necessary or desirable and, if so, that proposals for such amendments should be submitted to the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will stand over that type of legislation, legislation which, in particular, does not conflict with Part (b).  I do not stand over legislation which is not in conformity with the teaching of the Church to which I belong.  The last paragraph refers to the fact that in 1948 the Attorney-General who was then advising us, advised us that certain sections&mdash;nearly all of Part (3)&mdash; in the Health Act, 1947, were either unconstitutional in themselves or permitted regulations to be made which would be unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to deal with it when I was interrupted.  We <Col N="913" /> were advised in 1948 that certain sections in Part III of the Bill were in themselves unconstitutional and that others were likely to lead to a breach of the Constitution.  We ordered our then Minister for Health to remove these sections but that legislation was never brought in.  These orders were given as we thought these sections were unconstitutional.  We had also the other view with regard to morality and that was when this other matter developed.  The person responsible now represents himself as having prepared this legislation and says that we withheld approval from this legislation. Was it not because the Hierarchy was against these proposals?  The Deputy was apparently of the view, in his obsession, that he had got round the Hierarchy's objection.  I really do believe that to the end he believed that was the situation.  Quite recently these matters have been referred to again.  In this latest letter of April this year, the Hierarchy again returned to their main principles.  They spoke of their own objection to the original Act of 1947.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I would refer you, Sir, to Volume 63, column 793 of the Official Debates where, when a Deputy was quoting from an extract from a letter received from the Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and <Col N="914" /> Credit, the Chair said that he was not aware of any ruling to read the whole of any such letter if the House or any member asked for it.  There is a precedent there to which, as a point of order, I would direct your attention. I would further direct attention to Volume 48, column 1303, where a decision was given and made a precedent of the House.  The statement was then made by the Chair that when a Deputy makes a statement, the House has to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Deputy in making that statement so long as it was relevant to the matter under discussion and so long as there was no personal charge on any Deputy's honour involved.  As against that, with regard to documents that are not official documents, I would refer you to Volume 48, columns 1787-1788, where it is clearly declared that official documents should be quoted in full since an extract might tend to give a wrong interpretation.  I submit these three rulings declare the position in connection with ordinary documents, as against official documents, and make it perfectly clear that even though the House or a member may ask for it a Deputy is not required to read the whole of a letter even if he wants to refer to the actual details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall relate them to the amendment.  I am referring to the amendment which proposes to introduce a new section that the Minister may, by Order, insist that institutional services of a specified <Col N="916" /> class shall be given in a health institution and that institutional services shall be given in the institution to a specified class of persons.  These institutional services are defined to include diagnosis, advice and treatment in the institution.  There are two matters to which I wish to refer&mdash;that the Minister, by Order, may direct a health authority to give certain treatment in a particular institution and that, if he does so, the health authority maintaining that institution must comply with that direction.  I was pointing out that we had already amended that legislation in respect to the teachings of religion and that a patient who elevated this point should not be made to undergo treatment or to submit himself to a health examination contrary to the teaching of his religion.  I am asking that a further safeguard be inserted in this clause by having that same exclusion made in respect to the doctor who may be ordered to give certain advice and treatment.  In that connection, I was referring to the immoral parts of the Health Act of 1947.  The immoral parts occurred in Part II, Sections 22 to 28. These, I suggest, had been condemned early on by the Hierarchy and I read their letters in that connection.  Then I went on to say that these particular parts had been made the subject of comment by the Hierarchy in the letter of April 14th, 1953&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The sections claimed the power, we were warned, to treat all the illnesses and the defects of children without any recognition of the existent rights of the parents.
