      <P>On the Report Stage, I would like to correct a statement which I made last night and which may, perhaps, mislead some people.  There was a certain amount of confusion; Deputy Sweetman put me a question in relation to receipts and I said that if there were two receipts for the same payment, the second receipt did not require to be stamped.  That is not, of course, a correct statement.  All receipts must be stamped but one receipt will cover the two transactions if the second statement is not in the form of a receipt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Minister has nothing to say in asking the House to pass the Final Stage of this intolerable burden on the people?  The Minister comes in and, by his silence, indicates that he has nothing to say when asking the House to pass the Final Stage of this Finance Bill.  We have had three days' discussion here in which the members of the Government patted themselves on the back for the daring and courage-which, apparently, in their mind, was only equalled by the interest they have in the ordinary people-which they had when they set out to impose the <Col N="854" /> Budget of last year, following upon the year before, and now repeated this year, on the people, where every aspect of their economic life and their domestic life has been crippled and disheartened by the burdens they have been called upon to bear.  They give us the idea that they foresaw the conditions that were going to arise for the people when they imposed the £11,000,000 additional taxation last year, when they took the £8,000,000 or perhaps this year the £9,000,000 additional from the subsidies that were given to the people for their food, and when they raised the bank interest or allowed the bank interest to be raised during the year.  Their attitude now is that they foresaw the conditions that were going to arise, but that they foresaw that these dark days for the people would bring forward a glorious sunshine of prosperity afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They took very good care to deny when they were imposing these burdens that there would arise for the people the hardships in respect of cost <Col N="855" /> of living, the hardships in respect of unemployment, the hardships in respect of loss of employment, and the destruction of initiative and the destruction of confidence in those people who on the private side of our economy should invest their savings and put their energies to the developing of the private side of our productive economy so that the savings of our people could be used in that arena which from time to time members of the Government say is the most important arena of production and application of capital we should have, where provision could be made for gradually increasing the number of our people that are employed and that are looking for their living in manufacturing industry or in commercial industry or in the various other aspects of our national life outside agriculture.  While the gloom and distress is still there they are trying to turn their backs on it and trying to turn their eyes to it and are insisting on painting the bright future that is going to come while every aspect of our economic life and every aspect of the Government work shows that their policy is sinking our people deeper into distress and deeper into lack of hope and lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no need to read between the lines.  He can read the actual statement of facts in the various reports of many of our manufacturing companies, their annual reports, and see the various ways in which taxation, the rise in the bank rate, the difficulty of getting savings to maintain and to develop their industries&mdash;how these factors in the situation brought about by Government policy are adversely affecting their power to maintain the very employment they are at the present moment giving.</P>
    <P>The Government from time to time quote a few rosy words as to the way in which employment is improving, but the fact is that in the various industries dealing with the production of transportable goods the amount of employment given there is still substantially less than it was in 1951 and in 1952.  The cost of living is still showing that there is not the tendency to stabilise that Ministers prophesied and that Ministers no doubt hoped for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> On the side of the capital development, the expenditure on capital works by the Government on the one hand and the provision of capital for the development and maintenance of our industrial and commercial life on the other, the Minister has given no idea where these savings are going to come from.  Various figures are quoted by members of the Government as to the amount of capital works on the Government side that they intend to put in hand this year.  Ministers are quoting the figure of £39,000,000 which the Minister for Finance himself indicated in his Budget speech was going to be reduced to £36,000,000.  Will the Minister say where he is going to get that £36,000,000 and will he say the rate of interest he proposes to look for that money at, and if the Government depend upon the people's savings for the production of that £36,000,000, will he say from what sources he expects that those who are developing and maintaining our manufacturing and industrial structure here will get the capital assistance that they require during the year?  The whole attitude of the Minister with regard to savings and with regard to capital is undermined and destroyed and distorted by the attitude that they insist upon keeping to with regard to the Marshall money.  At the end of last year the Minister, himself, spoke at a Fianna Fáil Cumann held in Belturbet.  He went up to some of the lonelier recesses of Cavan to say that, in raising the Marshall Aid money, &ldquo;the late Coalition has put this country into pawn and the only thing they left to their successors were the pawn tickets&rdquo;.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is continuing to follow that from time to time, calling the Marshall Aid a heavy tonic and saying it had been taken at the wrong time and that the mixture was wrongly prescribed.  It is now clear that the Minister for Finance got £22,500,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows it because many voices have insisted throughout the country on running the Minister's misstatement and <Col N="857" /> members of the Government have attempted to suggest that all they got out of the Marshall loan funds were pawn tickets.  Out of pure pique and spite and as part of the deliberate policy to see that the spending power of our people was curtailed the Minister blew in that £22,500,000 on the capitalisation of the schemes then instead of keeping it in the way in which it was intended that it would be kept, to act as a priming force, to act as a subsidiary help to the savings of our people when for one reason or another the savings of our people were not sufficient, that part of it that was given to the Government, to carry on the Government work or when there was the demand that we actually came up against where the controllers of credit in this country insisted on getting more blood out of the turnip than they were entitled to get.  Both the Minister's taxation policy and the deliberate policy of the Minister in throwing away the assistance that was put into his hands so that he might be able to flank himself and defend himself against extortionate demands for rates of money have brought him into the position in which he is now, a position into which the Government deliberately walked because they deliberately applied to this country a policy that was conceived by Great Britain to deal with their problems there.  The problem there was to create unemployment in normal industries, in order to force people to work in armament industries and main export industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is patting himself on the back, as other Ministers are, that they have stopped &ldquo;the spending spree&rdquo; of our people by bringing the balance of payments within control. I think the final figure given for the adverse balance of payments was about £15,000,000.  What is our position to-day?  We find that there has been a reduction in our trading deficit in January of £3,270,000; in February, of £3,150,000; and in March, of £2,670,000.  That is to say, in the first three months of this year there has been a continuing reduction in our trade deficit to the extent of <Col N="858" /> £9,000,000 and, if the preliminary figures be taken into consideration, £11,000,000.  Part of that is due to slightly increased export prices and somewhat reduced import prices. There is a definite reduction in the value of our imports, however, and that, whether the import price is high or low, tends to improve our balance of payments; but the reduction in the value of our imports is reflected in commercial depression here and in unemployment.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is boasting to-day that they are further bringing the balance of payments under control here, they are doing it by a deliberate policy of some kind which has as a result, as they know now, a continuing increase in unemployment and a continuing disturbance of the confidence of our commercial community.  At the same time, there is standing in the way of necessary imports for continuing industrial and commercial life a very substantial increase in the demand made by the Revenue Commissioners on imports.  We find that in the first three months of this year the sum of £10,234,000 was collected by way of customs on goods coming in.  That was £1,468,000 more than was collected at the ports in the first three months of last year.  While the policy of the Government on taxation, bank rates and so on, is continuing to harass the people and produce unemployment and to threaten the existence of the employment fabric we have here, not to talk of further development of it, the Minister's hand is in every pocket that he can find.  He has taken £1,460,000 additional out of the pockets of people who are importing necessary and useful goods for the maintenance of our industries and of our people.</P>
    <P>The reckless way in which the Government is proceeding is painted as a gigantic effort that was necessary to take this country &ldquo;out of the financial and economic morass&rdquo; that three years of the unified effort of every other Party in the House had brought. The fact is that in our three years, in the three years of the inter-Party Government, we reduced taxation, stabilised the cost of living, increased <Col N="859" /> employment, induced enterprise, and increased production.  We made use of the moneys that were so effectively and so generously made available by the American Government for the purpose of assisting, in a transition period, the trade of a Europe which was destroyed by so many years of war.  We made use of these loans to put them into the hands of our commercial community to keep their businesses going.  The funds made available to the Government as a result of this loan were husbanded, to be used to the very best advantage here.  Instead of putting, as the Minister insists on putting, any additional accretions that arise out of our international trade, any additional increase in our sterling assets, into the hands of the British financial machine in order to help and develop the British machine, we were using every possible £ for which there was an opening here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When they come in here now, they are so blinded with prejudice and so determined to bolster up their consciences in relation to the damage they have done this country, particularly for the last couple of years, that nothing is too blatant for them to say or declare in relation to the work that was done during the term of office of the inter-Party Government. The Minister now has the country in the condition to which he has reduced it by his policy.  He is lacking the assistance of the money we left him to be a priming source, a support to our people's savings in carrying on the capital work that the Government requires to carry on.  While they are twiddling their thumbs and waiting for the prosperity that they boast about and pray for to come around the corner, they have nothing better to do than to belie and to calumniate and to demean everything that was done by any other person here during those three difficult post-war years.  They even slander and insult those whom the Taoiseach in the end of 1947 went over to collaborate with and to make arrangements with for bringing to this country whatever benefits the Marshall moneys might offer us.</P>
      <P>The Minister has nothing to say when asking the House to pass this Bill.  The damage that the Minister is doing here, or the measure of the enormity of the Minister's action to-day, is indicated by, for instance, the total expenditure that is contemplated from both capital expenditure and supply services over the current year, compared with the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure for 1950-51 was £99,419,000; of that, the total tax and non-tax revenue was £77,356,000; in 1951-52, it was £123,494,000, of which the total tax and non-tax revenue was £83,905,000; in 1952-53, it was <Col N="861" /> £128,723,000, of which the total tax and non-tax revenue was £95,918,000; and the estimate for the current year is £137,472,000, of which £101,172,000 is for tax and non-tax revenue.  So that as between the year 1950-51 and the current year the amount of tax revenue has gone up from £67.7 million to £86.2 million, and when we take the non-tax revenue with that it has gone up from £77.3 million to £101.1 million. The capital that the Minister will be looking for is £36.3 million as against £22,000,000 in the year 1950-51.</P>
    <P>These financial exactions and these savings are being looked for by the Government from a people who have been suffering for the last two years under the greatest excesses financially that the Irish people ever went through and in the most hopeless conditions from the point of looking in the future for employment for their children and the maintenance of their homes.  It is no wonder then that in asking the House to pass the Fifth Stage of the Finance Bill the Minister was dumb.  The Minister is dumb in inverse ratio to the way in which the fathers of families are talking and complaining and to the volume of prayer in their hearts that the inflictions which the Government have imposed on the people will pass away soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure will strike another blow at the agricultural community particularly, because barley is the raw material of the spirit and beer trade.  The policy pursued by the Minister has brought to light certain statements made by him and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In his Budget speech the Minister for Finance said that taxation presses light on the land.  We see now that he is attempting to gather tax from the land through the imposition of these duties for which the publicans and the assistants in licensed premises will be the tax gatherers.  We remember, too, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that we should gather as much tax as possible from the people up to 7/- in the £ and let the Government do the spending for them.  That is the purpose of this very <Col N="862" /> high level of taxation.  I should like to remind the House of another statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1947, when he said that this country was facing four of the most severe years in its history.  That was from 1947 to 1951.  The change of government came about in 1948 and a different policy was pursued.  Instead of four years of very great hardship we had four years of progress and prosperity under the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>We had a Division in this House to-day and we should remember that those who voted with the Government voted for a reduction in the price of barley.  That is what it amounts to. When the inter-Party Government were leaving office, in 1951, the price of barley was £4 4s. per barrel.  When the inter-Party Government came into office, in 1948, the price of barley was controlled at 35/- per barrel.  It had been held at that figure for several years.  While the distillers were paying 35/- a barrel to the farmers for malting barley they were importing barley from the ends of the earth up to 89/- a barrel.  When the inter-Party Government came in the fixed price for barley was abolished and the farmers were able to make the best bargain they could with the firms who used malting barley.  The result was that there was a very large area of malting barley grown, in addition to the encouragement given in respect of the growing of feeding barley to supplement the maize imports that were necessary at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maize imports were necessary because the inter-Party Government set out on a programme to increase the pig population.  When the inter-Party Government came into office they found a situation in which there was a racket in the bacon trade and the housewife was lucky if she got a lb. of bacon with her two ounces of butter, her half-ounce of tea and a couple of ounces of sugar at the end of the week.  The inter-Party Government brought about a situation in which the housewife was able to choose from different grades of bacon according to the price.  That bacon was put on the counters by importing the maize as farmers had <Col N="863" /> not been got into gear in the matter of growing barley.</P>
    <P>That encouragement given in the matter of barley growing has brought great advantages to the country inasmuch as the pig population has been restored to a very high level.  We reached a stage in 1950 when we had a surplus and were able to export pigs for the first time in many years.  We had a surplus of pigs and bacon which was brought about by the policy in relation to barley which encouraged farmers to grow barley and get the best terms they could from the distillers and a good price for the feeding barley and which brought up the pig population and increased the bacon supplies.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the question of barley which is the basis of the beer and spirit trade now under discussion.  We have a situation now where some of the distillers say that they bought too much barley last year and the year before and have a surplus in hands and will want no barley during the present season.  That means of course that the production of barley has dropped considerably, apart from the fact that the Beet Growers' Association managed to upset the price of barley that was available to farmers in 1952, I think it was.  I do not think it ever happened before that individuals claiming to represent the producers negotiated for a reduction in the price of the product.</P>

      <P>I will not proceed with it, if you do not wish me to.  The position is that the basis of this taxation is barley.  It is barley that is going to pay this tax.  It is barley&mdash;when it has <Col N="864" /> been made into spirits and beer&mdash;that will pay the tax in the long run and the growers of barley are going to suffer.  They suffered last season and the season before, owing to the deliberate policy pursued, and the deliberate plan to depress barley prices. We know that every effort was made to depress the price of barley and the policy of the Government in relation to barley prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for this Marshall Aid in respect of which negotiations took place before the inter-Party Government took office, a programme was put forward and among other things it showed that it was proposed to reduce the acreage of wheat to 235,000 acres from a figure of something like 700,000 acres.  Then we have all this wail about the wheat acreage, not of course about yield. That programme indicated that it was intended to reduce the acreage of wheat to 235,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Also in the programme was intimated the acreage of barley and oats intended to be grown, among other agricultural products.  Now, Sir, the policy pursued by the Minister in relation to the licensed trade has caused the value of licensed premises to fall sharply.  The values have fallen even more sharply than the stocks and shares held by people who were getting, perhaps, 3 per cent. on them when the Minister decided to give 5 per cent. and other advantages with his National Loan last year.  Their stocks and shares have fallen, just as the values of licensed premises have fallen considerably in consequence of this taxation policy being pursued by the present Government.  But, at least, it is consistent inasmuch as the Tánaiste said a few years ago: &ldquo;Why not collect the taxes from the people and let the Government do the spending <Col N="866" /> for them?&rdquo; The Government is still trying to get money from the people and do the spending for them and this is a typical example of it.</P>
      <P>The consumption of whiskey during the last 12 months dropped 22 per cent.; the consumption of beer dropped 16 per cent., and it must be the increased taxation and the policy of the Government in relation to other matters affecting the domestic homes of our people that have caused that very considerable drop.  The Minister, of course, quoted figures to suit himself last night.  When he quoted figures for the months of April and May, 1953, he did not say a word about May last year, or April, and it would have been very helpful, at least to people who want to hear the truth if the Minister did give the figures for the same period last year and this year, or even the year before.  But the Minister did not do that.</P>
      <P>Let us remember too, Sir, that when the Minister intervened concerning maize imports the value of our total live-stock exports from this country at that time was £39,000,000.  In consequence of our policy of bringing maize into the country when it was required and when there was no barley being grown by the farmers owing to the fixed price of 35/-, let us remember that our exports were increased from £39,000,000 to £100,000,000 in consequence of having imported maize to rear pigs and provide bacon for this country and for export.  At that time, it was hard to get the farmers to believe that there was profit in barley growing after the difficult years they had when barley prices were fixed down to 35/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only in 1948 we got going, and the Deputy is wrong if he wants to say they could not sell it in 1948.  He is losing his memory as well as everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that even at this stage the Minister should realise that if he reduced taxes on spirits and beer he would get greater revenue.  It has been proved in the past that the 6d. per glass imposed on whiskey <Col N="867" /> brought in less revenue than a smaller duty would have brought.  That proves that he has taxed spirits and beer to beyond the level where revenue can be buoyant.  The buoyancy of revenue has disappeared in consequence of these heavy taxes and I feel that even at this stage the Minister should make up his mind that it is not the rate of taxes that is going to get revenue for him; it is the volume of taxes and the turn-over and the buoyancy that is there and that has disappeared at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week Deputies of this House were invited to reaffirm their confidence in a Government which had captured the reins of office with the assistance of Deputy Captain Cowan and his colleagues.  To-day we are asked to reaffirm our confidence in a Minister for Finance and the policy enshrined in the Bill that is now being discussed by the House and which in my opinion is responsible for the partial destruction of the economy of this country as well as upsetting the ordinary living conditions of the plain people in every part of this country.  I listened attentively and in amazement to the Taoiseach speaking here last week.  I was amazed when he claimed that the policy of himself and his Government was in strict accordance with the old Sinn Féin policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how anybody who ever knew the late Arthur Griffith or who ever read, as I read when I was a much younger man, the wonderful things he advocated in his paper and from public platforms, could assert or try to prove that the policy enshrined in this Finance Bill is in accordance with the policy advocated in those far off days. The late Arthur Griffith&mdash;and the Minister for Finance was one of his ardent supporters&mdash;never advocated the policy that money should be the master of the Government in this country or that the Government, if it was a proper Government and had any desire to carry out its own financial or economic policy, should be subject to the decisions of a small group of people who sit outside this House, but not very far away from this House, and who in effect lay down <Col N="868" /> Government policy.  Will the Minister when he is replying&mdash;I merely want him to make this clear because I find it very difficult to get a clear statement on the matter-state specifically whether it is the Government or the Standing Committee of the Banks sitting in College Green who fix interest rates on loans, either public loans or loans required by citizens carrying on private business?</P>
    <P>I have asked people who are in control of the Department of Finance, and some of them said that it was the Joint Standing Committee of the Banks who were responsible for the fixing of the rates of interest.  Others said that the last word is with the Government. If the last word is with the Government, particularly with the Minister for Finance, in fixing interest charges for national or local loans or loans provided under the private banking system for citizens of the State, then I would ask the Minister how he can defend the interest charge of 5 per cent. which he gave so willingly and so enthusiastically and which he is still defending as far as I know, to the people who subscribed to our last National Loan?  If it is possible and I believe it is possible that all the money that has been lying on deposit, the increasing sums which have been put into the banks on deposit by farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

      <P>The farmers who were riding around in Chryslers, according to Deputy Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing my remarks particularly to the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Cogan, I think, has not yet assumed any authority in the inside councils of the Government.  If it is possible to get at 3½ per cent. £100,000,000, £50,000,000 or £20,000,000 &mdash;the amount which the Minister recently sought and secured at a rate of 5 per cent.&mdash;from people who have their money in the banks, is it not a crime on the part of the Government willingly to hand out an additional 1½ per cent. for a loan which they could have got for 3½ per cent.?  I do not pretend to know what is happening <Col N="869" /> in the constituency represented by Deputy Cogan or any other constituency but I speak with fairly intimate knowledge of what is happening in my own constituency and I assert that never in my time have trade and industry been so badly hit as they have been as a result of the increase in the rate of interest for loans to farmers, ordinary citizens and people engaged in private enterprise.</P>
      <P>How can a farmer who is short of working capital increase agricultural production at a time when the rate of interest for agricultural loans has been raised for some reason from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent.?  Can Deputy Cogan, who is defending the Government on this Finance Bill, justify the raising of the rate of interest on agricultural loans from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. at a time when he and every one of us are only too anxious to encourage farmers to increase agricultural production? The farmer who has not got capital has to borrow at 6 per cent. the money necessary to increase agricultural production.  That is adding to the cost of production, a thing that should not be necessary in my opinion. Is there any reason why the rate of interest on agricultural loans should have been raised, even if it is admitted, for the sake of argument, that there was some justification for raising the rate of interest on other types of loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many Deputies sitting on either side of the House who, unlike your humble servant, are members of local authorities.  What is the position to-day in regard to loans sanctioned for local authorities for every aspect of their activities, but particularly in regard to housing, the provision of sewerage and water-works and such types of loans as are made available to local authorities through the Local Loans Fund?  I made inquiries recently regarding the amount of loans outstanding or due by the two country councils in the constituency which I have the honour to represent.  I got the figures in one case.  For the year ending the 31st March last, the total amount for which the ratepayers of the County of Laoighis are liable and have <Col N="870" /> to pay by means of rates for the repayment of loans and interest is responsible for a rate of 4/11 in the £. Would Deputies believe&mdash;I know of course Deputies like Deputy Corry must know the facts and therefore they cannot refuse to believe&mdash;that County Laoighis had to provide last year for the repayment of loans including interest a rate as high as 4/11 in the £?  Of that 4/11, 2/8 represents interest and 2/3 repayment of the principal.  The ratepayers are called upon to pay 2/8 in the £ to the gentlemen who, in effect, control the financial policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>The capital figure which has to be repaid, regardless of the rate of interest, renders necessary a rate of 2/3 in the £.  How in the name of goodness can this country survive this system when the people have to raise in their rates each year a sum, 60 per cent. of which is paid to a limited number of private bankers who operate in this country with the goodwill of the Minister for Finance and the Government? I do not know what country could survive that financial system for another 20 or 25 years or perhaps even for ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we are wasting time in trying to convert the Minister for Finance on a matter of this <Col N="871" /> kind.  The financial system which he is defending in this House to-day, through the machinery of the Bill that is now in its Final Stages, cannot be justified and it will have the effect of paralysing the economy of the whole country.</P>
      <P>The most serious&mdash;and I say this in all sincerity to the Minister for Finance&mdash;problem confronting the country to-day is the restriction of credit.  I am not sure that the Minister is fully acquainted with what is going on in the country in that respect.  Is the Minister aware that every trader in this country who, to a certain extent, was responsible from year to year or from the beginning of any year to the end of that year for financing the operations of tens of thousands of farmers, and other people, is now experiencing the very serious effects of the restriction of credit which has taken place since the Minister introduced last year's Budget?  Does the Minister deny that? If the Minister attempts to deny that there is a restriction of credit then all that I can say to him&mdash;and I do not say it with any personal animosity&mdash; is that he is not fully acquainted with what is going on in the country.</P>
      <P>What is the real cause of the hold-up in the housing programme, so far as local authorities are concerned? There seems to be an impression among a lot of people in this city&mdash; the people who are not fully acquainted with what is going on&mdash; that the number of motor-cars one sees in our cities and towns and throughout the country generally is a faithful reflection of the financial position of the people as a whole.  I wonder how many Deputies are aware of the fact that over 80 per cent. of the private motor-cars now operating in this country are purchased under the hire-purchase system?</P>

In any event, it is not a system that one can advocate so far as the safety of the financial position of the country is concerned.  If it is true-and it has been asserted in this House and apparently there are figures to prove it&mdash;that over 80 per cent. of the private cars of this country are purchased under the hire-purchase system, will Deputy Corry, who is a faithful follower of the Minister for Finance, say that that is a sound financial state of affairs so far as the people themselves are concerned?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Minister and some of his colleagues are not fully acquainted with the true financial position of the people of this country.  I suppose it is useless talking in this House or giving any reasons as to why there should be a change in that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say, when he is replying to this debate, whether he is satisfied that there is still a restriction of credit so far as a big section of the real producers of this country are concerned? Will he say if he is satisfied, apart from the question of restriction of credit, that the interest rates charged by the banking institutions for loans to those who are prepared to engage in national development are reasonable?  I am very well acquainted with a number of traders in my constituency and they tell me that since the Budget of last year those of them who have to get short-term credit, for the purpose of providing accommodation for their customers, particularly for their farmer customers, are constantly being carpeted by the local bank managers and reprimanded for their failure to keep their overdraft down to a reasonable figure.  I could quote names, cases and places to the Minister on this matter.  Some of the traders in my constituency with whom I am fairly well acquainted have to see their bank managers every Monday or Tuesday morning and make a confession to them and do penance and give an explanation as to why their overdraft <Col N="873" /> is not brought down.  As every Deputy is aware, the overdraft accommodation is given for the purpose of giving facilities to their customers.</P>
    <P>On more than one occasion I have heard the Taoiseach say in this House that he is not aware that there is any restriction of credit so far as creditworthy people in this country are concerned. Will the Minister for Finance repeat that statement, if he believes it to be correct?  I must assume and I will assume that the Minister for Finance, who is a very active man apart from the policy that he advocates, must be fully acquainted with the day-to-day financial affairs of the country and must, for that reason, be in close touch with what is going on and with the policy being carried out by our banking institutions.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Finance will not deny that, since his Budget policy of last year came into operation, traders all over the country are in trouble with their bankers because they are not able to keep down their overdraft to the level demanded by these bankers?  One trader in my constituency who does a big trade with hundreds of farmers tells me that he has to see his bank manager every Monday morning and make a confession and do penance for the sins which the manager and the directors of the bank say he has committed in respect of the size of his overdraft.  That trader, and his father before him, has been engaged in business all his life. He explained to me&mdash;and I am sure that this is nothing new to Deputy Corry and other Deputies who are acquainted with what is going on in their own areas&mdash;that, as is the usual custom in a provincial town or in a small town in the country, hundreds of his customers can afford to pay him only once or twice and, in a very limited number of cases, three times per year.  The extra accommodation which that trader requires, as a result of the policy contained in last year's Budget, is roughly £10,000 a year.  He has been doing penance every week for the sins which he is alleged to commit against the banking system by being brought into the bank manager's office every Monday or Tuesday morning <Col N="874" /> and carpeted for not bringing down his overdraft.  He has to give credit to the farmers until they are in a position to sell their barley, beet, wheat, cattle or some other commodity which they sell periodically.  I submit to the Minister that that system of restricted credit cannot survive another two or three years without endangering the whole structural economy of the country.  I do not know whether the Minister is fully acquainted with the situation.  If he is not fully acquainted with what is going on in the country, and with the methods being adopted by bank managers since last year in regard to credit facilities, then it is time he wakened up to this very serious situation.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the bank managers personally.  I know a number of bank managers and I know that they are acting on strict instructions, so far as the restriction of credit is concerned. What would have happened when the bank strike was on, if the traders had not provided facilities for their customers? I am not too sure that the Minister is really fully acquainted with the position in the country, so far as making credit available to farmers and all classes of people who were in a position to get credit on fairly reasonable conditions before the Budget of lest year is concerned.  Does he admit even now, after the experience of a year or more, that there is a deliberate policy on the part of the banks of restricting credit to creditworthy citizens?  If so, how does he defend a continuance of that policy or what action, if any, does he propose to take to alter that policy?  There is very little hope for the revival of agriculture, for an increase in agricultural production or for an increase in employment in the agricultural industry, unless and until the financial policy of the Government, as I now know it, is radically altered.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin, whom we are all glad to see back and taking such an active interest in financial policy, has referred to the restriction of credit in the past year. Deputy Davin should go back a couple of years to the time when Deputy <Col N="875" /> McGilligan was Minister for Finance and when we were putting questions to him, even though we were supporting him, as to whether or not he had given instructions to the banks to restrict credit.  Deputy McGilligan on many occasions denied that either he or the Government had given such instructions to the banks.  I mention that to remind Deputy Davin and other Deputies that it is not last year that the restriction in bank credits commenced to operate, but in 1948 and 1949.</P>

      <P>Definitely there were very serious restrictions in these years and complaints were made to me by creditworthy citizens that the banks refused to give them credit.  It has been my experience that the restrictions on the issue of bank credit and bank overdrafts have been substantially eased in the past 12 months. That is my own personal experience and it is the experience of people with whom I have been in contact, that there has been an easing of the restrictions on bank credit by the banks.</P>

    <P>One of our great difficulties in Dublin at the moment is our serious unemployment problem.  We have some thousands of young men able and willing to work who are unable to obtain employment.  These young men in desperation have taken to the streets in organised demonstrations, clamouring for work and drawing very effectively the notice of the public to the fact that they are being denied work, although they are able and willing to work.  Then, because they take these active steps to draw attention to their plight, to their demands, we find a newspaper, <i>The Standard,</i> over which some Deputies have control&mdash;Deputy <Col N="876" /> MacEoin, for instance&mdash;alleging that these men who are looking for work are Communists.</P>

      <P>As far as finance is concerned we in Dublin Corporation are not held up.  We have plenty of works to be done but if we are going to have the approach to public works that we have had from Deputy General MacEoin during the election campaign in regard to the provision of new buildings, new buildings for the civil servants, new buildings for Dublin Corporation and new buildings for the Dáil, then there will be no work for the thousands of people who are unemployed in Dublin City.</P>

I know that Deputy Collins is a very intelligent Deputy who can see beyond his nose <Col N="884" /> and is not tied up with the reactionary outlook of some of his older colleagues.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the problem of unemployment and I say there is only one way to solve the unemployment problem and that is to provide employment for the people.  We have the money.  I take the same line as Deputy Davin does in regard to monetary policy but monetary policy is not holding us up.  Under our financial policy we have the money to provide the employment.  We have the employment for the people but we have got to get a change of mentality in regard to the value of public works. Many countries in the world have maintained prosperity and their people in very good employment for the last 100 years by means of public works. The provision of large sums of money for public works in these countries is accepted as a matter of course.  Nobody in those countries would dare suggest that there should be a reduction of even £100 in the Votes for public works.</P>

      <P>I want to put it that the more money we spend in the cities buying the things the farmers produce the more chance the farmers have of being prosperous.  It is one of these big problems that we should not have to discuss in this way across the floor of the House.  We should all be agreed upon the value of and the necessity for public works.  As I say, we have the public works and the Minister for Finance will provide the money for them but we have got to have a change in the mentality which opposes public works.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago we had a suggestion for the building of a road to Bray.  There was an absolute necessity for that.  It was killed by the Minister for Finance in the late Government on the representations and the propaganda of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and of people who opposed the spending of public money on a work of that importance to the community.  I would much prefer that Deputies on all sides of the House would get together and study this whole problem of public works because it is only by means of public works that we can solve the unemployment problem.</P>

That was supposed to be a pretty big scheme.  I mention it to show that as far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, we have examined every proposal that will give employment.  We are not held up in any way by money. Every halfpenny that we spend on the roads in the City of Dublin is provided by the Government.

The Government ought to provide money to give employment to the people who are idle, doing work that is necessary to be done.  This is an emergency situation and ought to be tackled now.

If they do they will be in harmony with the rest of opinion in the House.  As far as the provision of employment for 10,000 people in the City of Dublin is concerned, I want to say to the Minister that it is not a job that can be dealt with by the Dublin Corporation or by any other local authority.  It is an emergency situation and it must be handled by emergency methods.  I would impress on the Minister the <Col N="894" /> necessity for the adoption of some scheme whereby this whole matter of public works could be dealt with by a committee of Ministers, a committee of Deputies, a committee of civil servants or by some people appointed specially by the Government, whether it be a number or an individual, to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Blue Lagoon, if you like; or a tunnel built under the Liffey.  There are one hundred and one things that could be done. There are many places in Dublin where we could have underground tunnels, and that work will have to be done, but it will have to be done under the control of some authority set up in an emergency way to deal with it.  In some cities one sees where one road is run right under the other.  Why can we not make an effort to do that in Dublin?  It would cost thousands of pounds but it would give substantial employment.  As somebody said here, you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs.  You cannot provide employment unless you are going to do that type of work, and you cannot provide employment unless the finance to pay the men is there.  We have a guarantee from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Finance that there is no shortage of money to do these works.</P>

      <P>Listen to these figures, Sir.  In 1951, there were 65,877 persons unemployed in Ireland in January.  In January, 1953, there were 87,283 persons unemployed, an increase of 32 per cent.  Deputy Cowan is about to disappear because he does not want to hear the facts.  In February, 1951, there were 63,000 persons unemployed. In February, 1953, there were 89,579 unemployed, an increase of 42 per cent. In March 1951, there were 59,570 persons unemployed.  In March, 1953, there were 85,541, an increase of 43 per cent.  In April, 1951, there were 54,913 persons unemployed.  In April, 1953, there were 84,041, an increase of 53 per cent.  In May, 1951, there were 49,187 persons unemployed.  In May 1953, 76,178, an increase of 60 per cent.  In June, 1951, there were 37,125 persons unemployed.  In June, 1953, there were 63,589, an increase of 71 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something happened between 1951 and 1953.  What happened?  There was a change of Government to begin with but that made no difference until that Government published a White Paper in the autumn of 1951 and introduced a Budget for 1952, of which this is a reproduction in this Finance Bill and I am saying in this House that the purpose of the Budget of 1952 and of the Finance Bill at present before the House was and is to create unemployment. I say the policy of Mr. Seán MacEntee, the present Minister for Finance, was deliberately designed by fiscal methods to create a pool of unemployment in this country and in every step he took he had the active co-operation and vote of Deputy Peadar Cowan and I challenge Deputy <Col N="897" /> Peadar Cowan or the Minister for Finance to deny that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance to-day said that he had never suggested or never encouraged any restriction of credit in this country.  On the 18th July, 1951, column 1899, here is what the Minister for Finance said in Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Private and public spending are causing congestion that can be relieved only by a reduction of one or the other; credit facilities are encouraging outlay on less essential goods; money incomes of all kinds are being raised irrespective of increases in output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance in Dáil Éireann makes that statement in public debate, what interpretation is to be put upon it by the joint stock banks of this country?  If they hear him go on to say: &ldquo;We propose to provide for a larger volume of capital expenditure than ever was provided before&rdquo;, is not the clear direction in that statement, then, let the joint stock banks restrict credit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that what he says? He says: &ldquo;Private and public spending are causing congestion that can be relieved only by a reduction of one or the other.&rdquo;  In the next breath he says: &ldquo;I propose to sponsor more public spending than ever was spent before.&rdquo; Does not that imply, does not it follow in irresistible logic, that he says: Therefore there must be a reduction in the credit facilities provided by the joint stock banks?</P>
      <P>That is the same Minister who gets up here and says: &ldquo;I never did it.  I never advocated the restriction of credit.&rdquo;  I challenge him to deny that he used those words.  He dare not deny it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not all.  That is the Minister for Finance who declared before the world, never mind the bankers of this country, that the lowest penny at which he would dare to ask the moneylenders to lend money <Col N="898" /> to the Government of Ireland was 5 per cent. and because he did that he raised the lending rate on the Local Loans Fund and under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act by as much as 1½ per cent.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. I am talking now about houses.  Did not he raise the interest rate under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act by 1½ per cent.?  Very well.  A man goes to borrow £2,000 to build his house.  What is 1½ per cent. on £2,000? Is not it about £25 to £30 a year? Is not that 10/- or 11/- a week on the rent the man has to pay to redeem the loan he raised to build his house?  How many men of our personal acquaintance in this country had plans made to acquire their own house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and pay for it out of their weekly earnings who, when the rate of interest was increased and the weekly charge raised by 10/- or 11/-, cancelled their arrangements? How many small contractors had five or ten houses built and customers for them who woke up the morning after that increase was made to discover that seven of the ten houses were jettisoned and were now on his hands and the bank was clamouring for the money and he could not pay the bank because the fellows could not borrow the money to buy the houses? How many small contractors of our personal acquaintance have gone into liquidation, sold their houses at scrap prices because they were made by the banks to sell, dismissed the two or three men they had working with them and have themselves gone back on the flooded labour market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told by these innocents here that they do not understand why the unemployed are marching through the streets of Dublin.  Some of the unemployed men who are marching through the streets of Dublin to-day may well have been small contractors who were employing men three years ago and not only are the three or four men they employed walking on the <Col N="899" /> streets but the contractors are out walking on the streets with them because they have gone back to the job of looking for work which they themselves were in a position to supply three years ago.  Deputy Cowan does not know why they are walking on the streets.</P>
    <P>I may go to Alderman Byrne or Deputy Belton, members of the corporation, and I may say: &ldquo;These are people who have friends in Monaghan. There is a man and his wife and two children.  They want a house.  They are at present living with the father and mother.&rdquo;  The reply is: &ldquo;Put it out of your head.  If he has not four children he has not a chance.&rdquo;  Can you imagine the exasperation of a man who is living with his father and mother and four or five children and his wife and two children and is told by Deputy Peadar Cowan that the proper way to employ the unemployed in the streets of Dublin is to build a new Dáil when he wants to get a house to put his wife and two children into it?  Go down into Meath Street, the streets I was born and reared in, Marlborough Street, Lower Gardiner Street, Summerhill, and tell the people living in the tenement houses there that Deputy Peadar Cowan thinks they ought to go on living there till he has built the Bray road and that if the bugs do fall out of the rotten roofs they can go on falling until Deputy Peadar Cowan has built a new Dublin Castle and that he cannot see in the City of Dublin any employment for the men walking the streets of Dublin unless we pull down Dublin Castle, unless we build the Bray road.  I declare to God it leaves me speechless to listen to a fraud of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Peadar Cowan's vote alone is what has established in this country a Government that has increased unemployment to the knowledge of us all by as much as 40 per cent. in two years, and now Deputy Peadar Cowan wants to tell us that the unemployment in the city is due in no small measure to the fellows coming home from England because they cannot get work in England and they want to come home to <Col N="900" /> draw the dole in Ireland.  He ought to be ashamed of himself.  God knows the Government that are hanging on to his coat-tails for their existence ought to hang their heads.  If Deputy Peadar Cowan stood in his constituency to-morrow morning it would take a whole regiment of the Irish Army to bring him safely through the constituency.</P>

      <P>God knows where we got the patience to listen to that fellow this morning tell us how to solve unemployment and call on Deputies of the House to gather around him, to resolve with him to relieve unemployment, his vote alone having put thousands and thousands of people into unemployment in the course of the last two years.  I say with deliberation that Deputy Peadar Cowan's vote has been used in this House to put into unemployment in this country from 20,000 to 30,000 people over the last two years and I say that it was the deliberate policy of the present Minister for Finance to bring that unemployment about, and I say that the increase in the bank rate, to which Deputy Davin referred, has thrown thousands of men and women in this country into unemployment, and I say that the Minister for Finance that endorsed and encouraged that development is a public enemy in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that if we could resume the policies that obtained in this country before the blight of Fianna Fáil fell upon us again, unemployment in this country could be brought under effective control and a growing body of men given decent employment in doing useful work.  I think the facts speak for themselves, that throughout the period of the inter-Party's administration unemployment steadily declined in this country. Under Fianna Fáil's administration since 1951 it has steadily increased.  I believe it could be made steadily to decrease again if there were in this country a Government that had the courage to use our own resources for the benefit of our own people and that did not feel it incumbent on them to <Col N="901" /> require our people to pay 5 per cent. for the use of money while they were lending six times as much to the British Government at 1¼ per cent. to build houses for their people while we charged our people 6½ per cent. for the money to build houses for our people. When I look at the faces of the Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting opposite me blushing at the mention of these facts I wonder what has happened our country that the folly of one man can be allowed to create the problems with which we are struggling at the present time.  I do not want to depart from that without reaffirming that I am certain that the present acute unemployment problem could be remedied. I do not agree with Deputy Peadar Cowan that the appropriate remedy for it is panic measures alone.  I gladly endorse emergency measures of a temporary kind to deal with the immediate problem, but that is of no avail if there is not an enduring policy designed to maintain the level of employment and not to rush from one crisis of unemployment into another, which seems to be the approach of Fianna Fáil to this problem.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I want to talk a moment about the Minister for Finance and his attitude to Marshall Aid.  I want to recall that the Minister for Finance on December 7th, 1952, speaking at Belturbet used these words: &ldquo;What justification was there for raising the Marshall Aid loan at all?  In raising that Marshall Aid money the late Coalition has put this country in pawn and the only thing they left for their successors were the pawn tickets.&rdquo; Now I want to ask the Minister for Finance will he tell me did the Irish Government on the 9th July, 1947, issue a note accepting the Marshall Plan?  I want to ask the Minister for Finance did Deputy P. Smith, Minister for Agriculture of the Fianna Fáil Government, arrive in Paris by special charter plane on the 8th July, 1947, to negotiate the Marshall Loan?  Was he followed to Paris on the 9th July, 1947, by Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, from Amsterdam? Did they attend the conference in Paris on the 12th July, 1947?  Did Deputy Lemass, on the 13th <Col N="902" /> April, 1947, pledge the support of the Irish Government to the Marshall Plan?  Did Deputy Lemass conclude his attendance at the conference on the 15th July and proceed thence to luncheon at the British Embassy in Paris?  Did the party fly back to Dublin by special charter plane, which had been kept in Paris during the conference, on the 16th July?  On the 20th September 1947, did Deputy de Valera fly to Paris by special plane, accompanied by an army of civil servants?  Did Deputy de Valera, on the 22nd September, 1947, sign the agreement and report at 5.32 p.m., at the <i>Quai d'Orsay;</i> and did he that evening dine at the British Embassy to celebrate the occasion?</P>

Did he tell the Marshall Aid administration that this is what he wanted to borrow the dollars for and that these are the things he wanted to spend the Marshall Aid dollars on?  And did he furnish this list to the Marshall Aid administration on the 23rd July, 1947?  Did he cause a copy of this list to be laid in the Library of Oireachtas Éireann, set out in an Annex, O.E.E.C./1/ Table II A&mdash;Requirements: Wheat and Flour, to be purchased with dollars?</P>

      <P>We all know that. There was inaugurated in this country a policy that provided more employment and a greater measure of prosperity than Ireland had ever known before.  That is what happened in June, 1948.  I am asking now, is the man who says that the Marshall Plan put this country in pawn the same man who went to Paris in 1947 to say that we so urgently required eggs and dried eggs from dollar sources that we were putting in our requisition four years in advance?  Is he the man who went to Paris to tell them that we <Col N="906" /> wanted meat, including bacon, so urgently that he was putting in his requisition four years in advance?  Is the man who spoke of wanting 590,000 units of wheat, as well as flour, rye, barley, maize, oats, rice, in each of these four years the same man who stumped this country and stated that Marshall dollars were squandered on consumer goods?  Will he tell us that when he gets up because that is what he did?  That is the official document. That is the document to which his Government put their signature. These are the purposes for which the head of the Fianna Fáil Government vouched in Paris that Ireland required Marshall Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When he asked for the loan he said he asked for the opportunity of participating in this Marshall Plan with a clear conscience and in his statement, I am quoting his words now from the report of the &ldquo;European Recovery Programme, Basic Documents and Background Information&rdquo;, presented by the Minister for External Affairs, P. No. 8792, he says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To seek from another what one could supply by one's own efforts is always unworthy.  It is doubly so when the assistance is requested from a friend who has proved himself generous repeatedly.  I am happy to sign this report on behalf of Ireland because I believe it to be an honest report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the report in which he tells us of our requirements for dollars over the following four years and he puts his hand on his heart in Paris and says: &ldquo;I am happy to sign this report because I believe it to be an honest report&rdquo;. If it were not, he says himself that he would disgrace this country by fraudulently approaching a generous friend, and that he can only approach a generous friend for the help because, &ldquo;cross my heart and hope to die,&rdquo; this is an honest report. The report says that in 1950-51 he <Col N="907" /> wanted dollars for 590,000 units of wheat; 5,000 units of rye; 200,000 units of barley; 600,000 units of maize; 570,000 units of oats; 170,000 units of meat, including bacon; 10,000 units of processed milk; 40,000 units of eggs and dried eggs; 21,000 units of fish; 3,462,000 units of potatoes; 230,000 units of vegetables; 77,000 units of fresh fruit; 35,000 units of wine; 11,000 units of tea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminding the House that the man who put his hand on his heart and declared that to be an honest and true report is the same man who, with his colleagues, had gone through this country saying that Marshall dollars were squandered on consumer goods.  He will do it again and he will find on his back benches a small minority who will understand the perfidy of that conduct and who will go out and repeat it, and he will find a vast majority who believe that the inter-Party Government borrowed dollars to spend them improvidently on consumer goods against the strong remonstrance of their own leader and who will go down the country and make fools of themselves protesting that it is true, until one day they will wake up to find that they have been made stooges of by their own leader, that they have been made public fools of by their own leader, and that they were being used as one would use a clown to entertain a crowd and to divert the attention of the crowd from the facts and from the conduct of which one has been guilty and which one is bitterly ashamed to admit before one's neighbours.  That is the same Minister who says that the Marshall Aid scheme was putting this country in pawn, whose own leader signed that agreement, whose own colleagues flew in special aeroplanes to Paris and stayed in Claridges Hotel until they signed the agreement for the Marshall Aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says that when we left office we left them nothing but the pawn ticket. There was a sum of £28,000,000 odd in hard cash on the desk of the Minister <Col N="908" /> for Finance, Deputy Séan MacEntee, when he took office in 1951&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of which he spent every cent in the ensuing five months. And he cannot deny that.  He says it was the commitments of our Government that forced him to spend that money.  I say that the commitments of no Government can bind the Government's successors.  We found commitments when we came into office to buy Constellations to fly across the Atlantic, to and fro.  But we cancelled them, because we said we did not believe they were good commitments and we came to Parliament and told Parliament what we were doing.  We violated no constitutional principle and did nothing that was not in strictest accord with the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to pay for that. I found a contract signed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the Argentine wheat and I had to pay for that&mdash;£50 a ton for what I could have bought for £35 a ton a week after I had come into office.  My gracious me! Was there not coal coming up the Liffey from West Africa, and people coming up to this House to get the commission on it?  The coal was coming up the Liffey for months after we came into office, but we had to take it, and pay for it and store it because it was a contract.  If it had been a commitment, it would have gone back down the Liffey like a scalded cat, and the commission men after it.  We had to take it, and pay for it and store it, and that was some of the junk that had to be financed in 1951.  But that is another story.</P>
      <P>We found commitments when we came into office to pull down the Kingsbridge and rebuild it at a time when there was not enough money in C.I.E. to pay the coal bill.</P>

We did leave £28,500,000 which he could dispose of as he thought best, and no commitments hypothecated that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only speaking of my knowledge of commitments placed on the Government of which I was a member.  We had plenty of commitments left to us by Fianna Fáil, but with these commitments we felt perfectly entitled to come before the Dáil and say that we thought they were bad commitments and that we were abandoning them.  The contracts were another matter.  If there were contracts signed on behalf of an Irish Government they had to be honoured and fulfilled.  I am saying that we left them £28,500,000 on the desk and that of that money they still retain £6,500,000 sterling with accrued interest, and they cannot deny it&mdash;the grant counterpart fund of the Marshall Aid scheme which they still retain.</P>
      <P>And this, then, is the man who says that this country was put into pawn. If it was, why did he not take the £28,500,000 that he found on his desk when he came into office, and walk round to No. 10 Merrion Square to the American Embassy and put that money down as a credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reason whatever, why, if there was any obligation on him, he could not take the money to the American Ambassador and say: put that £28,500,000 in your safe here in Merrion Square, and the undertaking is that we will find dollars, if dollars be available over the next 60 years, and as each instalment falls due, draw it out of your safe in sterling and we will find dollars to meet it.  At the present moment the problem is that <Col N="910" /> we have too many dollars.  If we wanted to pay our annual instalment in dollars, we need not have bought figs, prunes and raisins last year from California.  Instead of buying the figs, prunes and raisins we could have gone round with the dollars to the American Embassy and said: Now, take the first instalment of that sterling that we left as collateral out of your safe, and we will not buy figs and prunes and raisins from California.  We will give you dollars in exchange for that sterling which we left as collateral for the redemption of our debt.  Is that true, or is that false?  Could not the dollars, used to buy figs, prunes and raisins&mdash;to make mince meat for export to Great Britain and which we sold for sterling &mdash;have been used for the redemption for the annual gale of debt if the Minister wished to do it?  And could not this £28,500,000 sterling be left with the American Ambassador to be converted into dollars as each gale fell due for our account?  Could not that have been done if the Minister felt that the country was in pawn?</P>
      <P>There is no use in exposing this little man because the more you expose him, the brassier his countenance becomes. Every fraud and slander and libel that he could utter he has uttered about this country deliberately and if you nail them down and expose them for what they are he floats off on some other expedition to prove that our country is bankrupt and rotten and down and out.  But the facts remain. The agricultural industry which he in his White Paper said held no hope of making any contribution to the balance of payments problem of this country by increased exports, has virtually solved the balance of payments problem of this country by its increased exports.</P>

      <P>Listen to me, my successor can do a lot but my successor cannot persuade a cow to have a calf in 24 hours.  My successor can do a lot, but he cannot make a sheep have a lamb in five minutes instead of five months.  My successor can do a lot, but he cannot get a sow to farrow 24 hours <Col N="911" /> after she goes to the pig.  Rub that out.  It is not veal calves we are shipping abroad.  It is three- and four-year-old bullocks, or the beef from them. Even Deputy Corry will admit that. And it is the exports of the agricultural industry that have corrected the balance of payments problem of this country, although the Minister tried to justify his whole budgetary policy and the murderous impositions he placed on this country by the confident prediction that it could not possibly contribute to the balance of payments.</P>
      <P>There is one last point I want to make.  The Government wanted the votes of two particular Deputies to win its vote of confidence last week and promised the two Deputies that the proposal to put £500,000 extra on the farmers of this country would be cancelled, and in consequence of that promise they got their votes.  I say that notwithstanding whether there was a deal or haggling, those votes were paid for, and that the consideration of getting them was that the proposal to increase the rates on farmers be withdrawn.  I want to know is that true?  And if it is true, from what other source is that money going to come? It is very relevant.  Where is the money to come from to implement that undertaking? The Minister for Finance said that he depended on that £500,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress yesterday evening I had been stressing the point that the fact that sub-section (6) of Section 44 lays it down that every meeting of the consultative health committee shall be held in private would defeat the ends for which the committee is being created. I had discussed also the question as to whether the medical officer of health should be a member of the consultative committee and I had suggested that, as he more or less would be acting in advising the council relating to decisions <Col N="912" /> he might have taken on behalf of the health authority, it would not be suitable for him to be on this consultative committee.  Then I had reached the stage where I discussed the position of the county surgeon who, it was suggested, should also be on the consultative committee.  I had concluded on that by saying that in my opinion the county surgeon would be a good person to be on this consultative committee because in many cases a question, which we had been discussing a few weeks ago as to the venue of treatment of patients, would arise.  In many instances the matter would have been referred to the county surgeon&mdash;that was the Minister's intention as far as I could gather.  When it was a question of transferring a patient to a particular hospital for a particular type of treatment the matter would be referred to the county surgeon.</P>
      <P>The Minister may remember that when we were discussing the particular section dealing with that, I was not very keen on the matter being referred to the local surgeon concerned or the local physician as the case might be because he would be in opposition in practice to local practitioners and therefore it would place them in an awkward position in so far as it would be necessary for them to answer his questions if they were actually treating the patient.  It would be awkward also from the point of view of the patient who might have gone direct to the local practitioners rather than to the person who would be actually carrying out the treatment later.  The Minister apparently did not agree with that but, in any case, I think it would be a good thing for the local surgeon to be on this consultative committee because any safeguards that would be necessary are provided by the clause which says that two other registered practitioners who will be members of the local medical association will also be on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by some other Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy MacBride&mdash;that it was possible that there might be two separate medical associations in the country.  I <Col N="913" /> do not think that contingency will arise at all because the position with regard to medical associations, as I know it, is that there is only one medical association as a rule of which the parent body is the Irish Medical Association.  In some cases members of the local medical body are not members of the Irish Medical Association but as I explained are members of the local association.  I think, however, an adequate safeguard is provided by the provision which states that the consultative health committee shall include two other registered medical practitioners residing in the county, each of whom is nominated by a body which in the opinion of the council of the county is representative of registered medical practitioners practising in the county. I, therefore, am of the opinion that the county surgeon is a satisfactory person to put on this council because, even if he might be practising in opposition to the medical practitioners concerned in particular cases covered by this Bill, they have adequate safeguards in the clause introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In connection with clause (a) of sub-section (3), which provides that the membership of the committee shall include not less than four members of the council of the county, the suggestion was made by some Deputy that these four members could be nominated by the county council much in the same way as nominations are made to ancillary bodies such as vocational bodies, agricultural committees and so forth&mdash; that they need not be members of the county council, but that they could be nominated by the democratically elected representatives on the county council.  I think there is a good deal to be said for that suggestion.  It is very often the case that you might have somebody who was unsuccessful in the elections to the county council itself but who might be considered by the members of the county council as a suitable person to place on this committee. I think the Minister would not be giving a lot away if he met that particular point.  It is not a very big point.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of how often the consultative health committee <Col N="914" /> shall meet.  That is met fairly by the Minister in sub-section (5) of the proposed amendment which says that where meetings of a consultative committee have been held on six or more days in any year, no further meeting shall be held in that year save at the request by resolution of the council of the county or at the request of, or with the consent of, the county manager.  It might seem to meet the case pretty fairly to say that they shall have six meetings in the year&mdash;that they shall meet once every two months.  I am not a member of a county council or of a local authority of any sort myself but it seems to me that a county council meets once a month.  The agricultural committees and other ancillary bodies may also meet once a month and it therefore seems reasonable that the consultative health committee should be in a position to meet once a month if they so desire or consider it necessary.  It is rather arbitrary to provide that they shall meet only six times a year.</P>
    <P>I can quite see that the Minister has probably introduced that as a safeguard against a lot of unnecessary meetings.  There may be people who would want to hold meetings very often and that would lead to a lot of unnecessary work and unnecessary discussion about things generally.  I think, however, we have to accept the fact that there has been a considerable amount of controversy in relation to the proposed improved health services. This controversy has ranged far and wide.  We, on the Fine Gael Benches, stress the importance of these consultative committees in that we believe that they will act as a brake in respect of the particular alignment of health services to which we object.  We feel that we are handing over the rights of families and individuals to unnecessary State control.  I am accepting the fact that the Minister has met us to a certain extent with regard to the consultative health committees he is introducing. We, as I say, place great stress on these health committees inasmuch as they can act as a medium of control or a brake against any arbitrary decisions on the part of the health authority.  In spite of the extensive discussions we have had here, we feel <Col N="915" /> that this authority is more or less in the hands of one man.  We must accept the fact that in so far as any local authority has any say in any matter relating to the suggested improved health services, the final decision rests with the county manager.  The county manager has the final decision in everything. It is in the hands of one man except in so far as the democratically elected representatives of the people have the right to refuse the money. I think it was Deputy Allen who when speaking yesterday tried to stress the point that the democratically elected representatives, viz., the county council, had the right to oppose anything in that they could refuse the money.</P>
    <P>In particular things that come up for discussion, such as whether or not patient A should go to such and such a hospital, it is unreasonable to suggest that the democratically elected representatives themselves, the county council, would have the power to veto that by saying: &ldquo;We will not vote the money to permit such and such a person to go to such and such a hospital.&rdquo; It is not reasonable to suggest that they would have the power to stop the county manager from doing a certain act in relation to the health services.  We accept that they have the control of the finances but they have not really any executive authority whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We place a lot of stress on the importance of this consultative council. We feel that unless that council is in a position to discuss in an open field any decision that is taken by the manager or by the health authority, to put it that way, they really will not be serving a function.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment of sub-section (6) of Section 44, which reads: &ldquo;Every meeting of a consultative health committee shall be held in private.&rdquo; That really nullifies straight away the importance of the authority that may lie behind the consultative council.  It defeats its own end.  I accept that the Minister is trying to meet the force of public opinion in this State.</P>
    <P>Public opinion in this country is <Col N="916" /> against handing over the rights of the family to State control.  This consultative health council be it a general one or a local one, such as we are discussing, is important in safeguarding that matter.  The Minister has met us to a certain extent but he is entirely nullifying it by sub-section (6).  I would ask him to change it.  It is very easy to change it.  It will not affect the issue one way or another.  All he has to do is to change it from &ldquo;shall be held in private&rdquo; to &ldquo;may be held in private&rdquo;. There are certain things that must be discussed in private.  If you are going to get down to brass tacks, if you are going to discuss health matters, certain things must be private and must be discussed in committee around the table.  The function of this consultative health council is to act as a brake on any arbitrary decision taken by any one individual relating to the health of the people&mdash;and it is entirely nullified by sub-section (6) of Section 44.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter very carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde is quite correct in suggesting that we have ranged very wide in the discussion on this amendment, particularly Deputy Mulcahy.  I consider that such remarks could not help very much because the Bill is being administered under the existing County Management Act.  As Deputy Allen pointed out, there is no change whatsoever in principle to the state of affairs that exists at the moment and has existed for a number of years.  Therefore, I do not think that Deputy Mulcahy's contribution helped in any way at all.  It merely prolonged the debate which, probably, was the intention, in his regard at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has a certain sympathy with the Minister due to the fact that this section appears to be put into the Bill in order to satisfy, I suppose, the Medical Association in particular. Yet, it seems that there is still objection by Fine Gael.  I am not awfully clear as to whether they object to the <Col N="917" /> section or whether their objection is to the County Management Act and that they want to try to amend it on this Health Bill.</P>
    <P>The odd points made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde could be boiled down to the question of publicity&mdash;publicity for the committee's activities Deputy Kyne also made the same remark.  He is a member of a local authority and I would attach a lot of importance to his objection to the possibility of secrecy which would in any way hinder the activities of public representatives in bringing up points that they might want to air or put right for their constituents or the people whom they represent on the local authority.  I wonder if Deputy Kyne's point has not been met by the suggestion that this committee will meet in private and that members of the local authority will still have their full rights to raise any point that may be worrying them in the local authority.  I wonder if this further consideration has occurred to Deputy Kyne and to Deputy Dr. Esmonde?  Deputy Kyne was worried about the question of a complaint against a doctor, a hospital, a health institution or a local authority.  I wonder if Deputy Esmonde would agree to that point being aired in public and getting full publicity.</P>
    <P>My own attitude to the question of publicity in health matters is, I think, the attitude of the medical profession, that we must at all costs maintain to the maximum the secrecy, the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship. Secrecy with regard to any illness or sickness which any person, no matter who he is, rich or poor, which has been confided to a medical practitioner must be safeguarded to the maximum and anything which would jeopardise that relationship should be shunned at all costs.  I would probably go a very long way with Deputy Kyne in regard to malpractice, bad medicine, bad hospital treatment or anything of that kind not being suppressed but being open to public exploration, but I think his worry is covered by the Minister's point that he still has the right to go <Col N="918" /> to a member of the local authority or to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I want to put this other point to Deputies who may not feel as strongly about it as I do, that matters of health are not matters of roads, engineering or drains.  There is that tremendously important fundamental principle of medical practice that all matters relating to the health of the individual are the personal and private property of the doctor and patient and should be so maintained.  Consequently, I am very strongly opposed to public sessions of this consultative council. Again, taking the case of the voluntary hospitals, most of these voluntary hospitals have consultative councils&mdash;they call them boards&mdash;to advise them and I think they would consider it unthinkable that any of the meetings they hold should be held in public or that any private matters discussed, even matters of policy, should be discussed in public. The average doctor and member of a voluntary hospital board would be very surprised if it were suggested that any of their meetings, whether dealing with pure administration or, more particularly, with the personal and private matters of patients receiving treatment in the institution should be dealt with in public.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would say that it is regrettable that, in relation to these consultative committees, we should have all this talk about bureaucracy, State interference and State control. The State comes out of this whole argument extraordinarily well.  Here we have the delegation of responsibility to a paid official of the State, and, in order to guard ourselves even further, we have control of that man, because we pay him and make the laws under which he carries on his activities.  If we do not like him, we change him and if we do not do so, we are fools and must blame ourselves. We cannot blame the manager.</P>
    <P>To get back to the point of control, we are accepting the fact that we appoint advisory councils to supervise the activities of these people, the manager and his executives.  These councils, the Minister tells us, are not to be accepted by the voluntary hospitals which are also to be part of our <Col N="919" /> health organisation.  They are to be health institutions and they are to spend considerable sums of money&mdash; something in the region of £750,000 a year, provided by this House&mdash;but with no functions whatever in relation to the voluntary hospitals.  In this matter, the State is being particularly careful to observe all the best points of democratic Government, in seeing that the services are well organised, that the money is well and properly spent and in accordance with the rules and regulations with which we bind ourselves, but which we are not going to apply to the voluntary hospitals at all.  Apparently, they will not accept any of these, while we accept these things for our nominees on the local health authorities.  I feel that publicity would be very bad&mdash;it would only lead to abuses and would do damage to medical practice generally and health services altogether.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate with regard to the personnel of the advisory council, it struck me that it was like overhearing a conversation in some exclusive mid-Victorian club as to whether amateurs and players should mix, whether they could have tea or dinner together&mdash;in the suggestion that paid officials should not have the same functions or responsibilities on the advisory council.  What is the difference between a paid employee of a local authority and an unpaid member in relation to his functions?  What difference does it make to the advice that would be given by the county physician or county surgeon that he is an employee of and paid by the local authority?  The amendment says that this advisory council need not necessarily be one which will offer criticism, although it should and can offer criticism, but the suggestion that these paid officials should be different from the people who are elected or nominated, because of their public work or some other reason, and should not have the same status on the council is silly.  It is an old fashioned and out-dated argument&mdash;the relationship between servant and master.</P>
    <P>In the case of the voluntary hospital <Col N="920" /> system, they have paid doctors who are very often nominated to the boards of the hospitals because they can give useful information about the practical running of the hospitals, from the medical and surgical point of view.  It may be said that they are not paid.  Of course, they are, but I do not propose to go into that long subject.  Even if they are not paid, I still do not think it makes any difference to their merit or value as advisers, co-equal advisers, on a council.  The voluntary hospital system has been in existence for a long time and has done its job and I do not think it has suffered any particular damage by having employees, surgeons and physicians as members of the boards.</P>
    <P>At the other extreme, take the modern approach to the management of industry.  Surely Deputy Kyne will accept that the trade union movement would insist on the employer, if possible, having the workers in his factory sitting on his councils and committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was I who made that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me, however, that it is desirable that we should get away from this 19th century attitude towards employees and all the rest of it.  A man should be considered on his intrinsic merit as an adviser and not from the point of view as to whether he is an employee or a master.  I do not think that would be tolerated in this country. There is no reason why a man should not be criticised and why he should not be asked to defend himself.  There is no reason why he should lose face or caste because he is not consulted by the manager.  That seems to be an utterly childish approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation is an accepted part of the control and management of industry, factories and institutions for the past 20 years, even in backward countries.  Even the United States, backward and all as it is in social matters, has accepted as a principle control of industry by the worker.  I see no reason why these county physicians <Col N="921" /> and surgeons should not be accepted as members of these councils.  They can be very helpful. I do not know anyone who would be of more assistance in helping a county manager to decide than would be the legal practitioners, the employees of the local authorities and the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the proposition is that the committee should be merely a consultative one.  I do not think there would be any great danger of serious decisions being taken.  Deputy Corish is worried about the question as to whether votes would be taken from democratic non-elected members of the council which might have the result of swaying the decision of the council.  I think that is attaching probably too much importance to the part these consultative councils will play in health services.  They will be purely advisory.  I think they will have no great function at all but if it satisfies the medical association to have them I see no reason why they should not be put in.  They can do no harm. They may do a certain amount of good.</P>
    <P>On the point of the number of meetings to be held, I think the Minister's answer is a good and effective one and should meet Deputies' difficulties.  I would have no objection to these bodies meeting 12 times a year instead of six times a year.  I would be strongly opposed to undue publicity in relation to health matters.  I have no great fear at all of the further development of bureaucracy as a result of the expansion of our health services just as I have no great fear of final decisions being handed over to one man.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental argument on the whole question of the expansion of State services as between health and social services and so on.  I do not see that we should be afraid of this at all. We are all nominated in open election for a term here to enact legislation and to carry out certain functions under that legislation or appoint certain executives to implement our will.  So long as those executives implement our will I can see nothing immoral or <Col N="922" /> wrong in anything they will do because theirs will be a delegated responsibility from this House and we will have a continuous check on their activities.</P>
    <P>We have no check on and we have no rights at all in relation to the voluntary hospitals even though we pay out a tremendous amount of money to them.  I see no reason why we should be worried about the activities of men whom we appoint by statute and whose activities will be governed by regulations made by the Minister and whose activities can be curbed at any time by a decision of this House.  The State machine is not something to be feared.  People are nominated here to govern the country and the activities of this House are an expression of our opinion in relation to particular matters relevant to health and social welfare and so on.  So long as we have active Ministers in Government and articulate Deputies there is no danger at all of any growth of bureaucracy.  I am very anxious to see this Bill passed into legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to a few points made by Deputy Dr. Browne. I made an appeal in relation to the freedom of the Press.  The Minister in his reply partly indicated where the criticism that I saw could be made public.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne, however, has put his finger on the actual point that is worrying us.  This is a new consultative council.  That is all we know about it.  We do not know what the functions of the council will be.  We do not know what will be discussed by the council.  I think no one does at the moment.  We are afraid that it will be used as a council to which all matters relating to health will be referred by the county council or by other public representatives. One may be told that if one has a grievance the grievance should be dealt with by the consultative council.  In that way one will be choked off, as it were, from raising one's complaint. The chairman will refer one to the consultative council.  The case made before that council will not be publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Now Deputy Dr. Browne knows what happened during his period in office as a Minister; a particular doctor did not give the services required by law to a patient.  Now, supposing that patient's people do not notify the Minister but the matter comes to the knowledge of a conscientious councillor who happens to be a member of the consultative council and he brings it before the committee, what will the position be? Remember, there will be at least four doctors on that committee, all members of an association.  The charge will be against one of them.  Is it not natural to assume that they will play down the complaint?  Publicity is the only instrument that will focus attention on the wrong done and cause it to be put right.  Publicity is the only instrument to put fear into people, thereby ensuring they will pay more attention to their work and give the services they are bound to give.  One cannot raise a complaint again if the council has already dealt with it because one will be told that the matter has already been discussed and the council has decided against one.  We know what it is to find the council arraigned against the few who may be described as &ldquo;extremists&rdquo;, the few who are not afraid to stand up and fight the Irish Medical Association, or any other association, if they think they are thereby doing the right thing for the working people.  Remember, it is the working people who will be the patients or the guinea pigs under this. I think it would be a generous gesture on the part of the Minister if he would leave it to the council to decide as to whether or not they will have the Press present.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Dr. Browne's point in regard to confidence between patients and doctors, sub-section (1) of this section clearly indicates that there will be no individual cases to discuss. No member of any board would wish to make a health matter between a doctor and a patient public in order to satisfy the curiosity of the public.  I do not think anyone would do it, and no reputable newspaper would publish it. Even if some member made reference to it no reputable newspaper would publish it.  I have never seen it happen <Col N="924" /> and I have a pretty wide experience in regard to local authority business. If there is a secret the patients themselves will feel that the matter is being smothered.  I cannot at the moment see what function we are going to have.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Deputy Corish in connection with the doctors, I do not think that he had any intention of conveying that the ordinary member would in any way resent a doctor, because he is paid by the county council, co-operating with the council.  We welcome co-operation between the officials and the members.  The point was that the doctor, who is a paid official, might very often be subject to a charge and it would be unfair to have a colleague of his acting as judge and jury in such a case.  I think you are taking from the council that which I, as a Labour member and as a member of similar councils, value most and found to be most effective.  It is true that if you had a T.D. on the council he could take the matter up in the Dáil.  But on every council there is not a member of the Dáil.  Again, it is not easy to get a question like that satisfactorily answered in the Dáil, as the Minister will point out that it is the county manager and not he who has authority over those people.  Under the Managerial Act, the county manager has the right to take references out of the minutes.  The matter is not as simple as Deputy Dr. Browne seems to think. It may not be very important but, in my opinion, this is a matter the principle of which the Minister could concede.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I would not have risen again to discuss this amendment were it not for references by some Deputies this morning.  The Minister, I think, dealt very frankly with the various matters I mentioned yesterday and admitted the difficulties that I put to him.  On this question of secret meetings, I think the Minister should leave it optional in the way in which Deputy Dr. Esmonde suggested. It is always unwise and of doubtful constitutionality as a matter of fact to provide that any meeting be held in secret because the whole purpose of democratic institutions and democratic government is to have publicity so <Col N="925" /> that the people would be aware of what was going on.  The matters mentioned by Deputy Kyne are very real. Let us examine the kind of matters that will probably come before these committees.  Before doing so, however, let me say that I am quite prepared to concede immediately to the Minister that probably 75 per cent. of the work of the committee would be carried out in private and that the Press would not be present.  We will leave that to the committee to decide.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the kind of cases that are likely to reach a committee of this kind.  There will be complaints, for instance, as to the inadequacy or quality of food supplied to hospitals or all the institutions in the area of the committee.  There will probably be complaints in regard to the dispensary doctors and the doctors administering the scheme that they are not fulfilling their duties properly, that they are not as readily available as they should be when required.  There will be complaints against some of the officials of the council.</P>
      <P>I think it is no harm to have these complaints dealt with publicly.  It would be healthier.  If there is any kind of a scandal, for instance, in some institution the whole neighbourhood will probably hear stories about it. Would it not be just as well to have the matter dealt with publicly at that stage?  I fully understand the Minister's purpose in putting in this provision. I concede immediately that probably 75 per cent. of the work of a committee of this kind will be done privately but I think the committee should be left a certain discretion in the matter so that it could, in certain circumstances, decide whether a particular matter was one which they had better have investigated publicly and let the public know what the answer is to the charges that have been levelled against a given institution or doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from that, I do not like any provision in a statute which provides that meetings be held in secret and that the Press should be debarred from attending.  That goes very close to a denial of the right of freedom of <Col N="926" /> expression.  I know it is not the Minister's desire to infringe upon those rights.  I fully understand the purpose of this provision.  By and large I think it would be better if the Minister altered that particular paragraph and allowed the committee a certain latitude and discretion as to whether it should hold its meetings publicly or privately.</P>
    <P>One matter that I mentioned to the Minister yesterday was in regard to the number of meetings.  The Minister quite properly pointed out in reply that the county manager could always organise additional meetings.  That is so.  If the Minister thinks of the actual practical working of a committee of that kind, he will visualise many circumstances in which the committee will have to meet much more often than six times a year.  I put this instance to him.  Suppose a complaint made by a patient or a member of the public against a dispensary doctor or against a hospital comes to the committee. That complaint comes before the committee at one meeting.  The committee will have no information in regard to it and all it can do at that first meeting is to ask for a full report on the doctor or hospital concerned so as to get their answer.  Straight away you will have two meetings.  You can assume that there will be at least two meetings before any progress will be made to investigate any complaint that comes before the committee.  In regard to the second meeting, it is quite probable that further information will be required from the person making the complaint.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of very grave import, but I think it is unwise to put in a proviso that limits the number of meetings to six in the year.  I would imagine that committees of this kind would not want to meet more often than is necessary, and that is why I think they should be left a discretion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne thought it necessary to have a tilt at some of the things I said yesterday in regard to the membership of these committees&mdash; the inclusion of the county surgeon and of the county medical officer of health. I pointed out yesterday that these two officials should be available to <Col N="927" /> attend meetings, and that they should be in a position to supply information to the committee, but I think it is creating an extremely bad precedent to put on the committee officials whose conduct is likely to be investigated&mdash; to be appointing them, so to speak, judge and jury over themselves.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that some of the functions of the committee will certainly be to investigate complaints as to the administration of the medical services and as to the adequacy of the services provided, complaints as to the quality of the food or as to the quality or adequacy of the treatment, and complaints with regard to the conduct of doctors.  Deputies should bear in mind that, straight off, these committees will consist of four doctors and four members of the county councils. Far be it from me to start attacking the medical profession, but it seems to me that, when a complaint comes in against doctors or against the county surgeon or the county medical officer of health, the best tribunal to determine that complaint is not the county medical officer of health or the county surgeon or the other doctors on the committee.  I would rather see that the committee was not loaded with doctors for the purpose of investigating complaints of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Four doctors and four members of the county council and, as the Minister says, two others.  The Medical Association will be adequately represented on the committee when it has four members on the committee of every local authority to advise on health services.  I am not saying that is a bad thing, but I want to put in some safeguards to ensure that the members of the medical profession will not be the judge and jury of their own efficiency or inefficiency.  I think it is quite obvious that, if complaints are made as to the efficiency of the county medical officer of health or the county surgeon, or if there are complaints as to the efficiency of dispensary doctors or as to the quality of the food supplied to the patients in hospital, it would be much more desirable to have these complaints investigated by persons other than those who are directly responsible themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take an example.  We have an extremely efficient Clerk of the Dáil and an extremely efficient staff.  I have no doubt that they are far more efficient than many members of the House, and that they could very often make much more valuable contributions than many of us make, but we would not dream of such a completely new concept of democracy as automatically to make the officials members of the House.  The officials are there to help and to advise the House and to provide information, but we would not dream of giving them the same rights as members of the House. <Col N="929" /> Therefore, I think we should be slow to do that in the case of local authorities.</P>
    <P>We are, in fact, appointing two officials on these committees.  It is certainly a new departure in democratic Government.  I listened to the Minister yesterday, and I understand fully the reasons which prompted him to do this.  I think it is extremely desirable that these two doctors, the county medical officer of health and the county surgeon, should be available at meetings of these health committees, but I still have grave doubts as to whether it is wise to make them actual members of the committee because undoubtedly they will, very often, be placed in the position of having to consider complaints against themselves, either against themselves personally, or against their administration or against people working under them.  I think that is bound to put them in a very invidious position when matters of that kind arise.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, it is inevitable that there will be a number of disputes and a conflict of views between the county manager and members of a committee of this kind.  Again, I think that the paid officials of the council. on a committee of this kind, will be placed in an invidious position whenever such disputes arise.  They will be there under the direct control of the county manager and will be placed in a certain amount of difficulty if they have to take sides in disputes in which their own chief is involved.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I did not mention before.  It is in regard to the regulations which are provided for in sub-section (8) of the amendment. I should like to know if the Minister will agree to have these regulations tabled in the House in the ordinary way by making the usual arrangements for the annulment of the Orders by the House.  That is not provided for in the sub-section.  It is probably due to an oversight that it was not.  I think that, as a general rule, it is well to provide for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy MacBride made a point against the inclusion of the county surgeon and the county medical officer of health on the advisory committee from two points of view, firstly because it is not feasible to have paid officials as members of a committee like this along with members of the county council and others.  I do not see any great objection to that because it is an advisory committee.  If they are sitting at the table it makes very little difference whether they are members of the committee or not because they are purely advising.</P>
      <P>The only thing I would say in favour of having them members of the committee is that they would have a better right to speak.  If they were not members they might feel bound not to speak unless they were asked for their opinion.  If they were members of the committee they would speak if they thought they could add to the conversation or contribute to what was going on.  From that point of view I think it would be better if they were members. In a purely advisory committee like this there is scarcely ever such a thing as division or a vote.  I was 15 years in the Department of Agriculture. I had about a dozen advisory councils there meeting occasionally.  In all the time that those advisory councils met there was never such a thing as a division or vote.  The considered opinion is taken and conveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy MacBride was that the advisory committee would be overloaded with doctors.  There might be something in that.  If the Dáil agreed with Deputy MacBride from that point of view, I would be prepared to alter the constitution so that they would not have as high a proportion of the representation as this amendment provides.  It must be remembered, of course, that the Irish Medical Association were pressing for this and made very much of the point that they were the best people to advise on health services.  As this is an advisory committee I thought <Col N="931" /> they should get a good representation, but, as I say, if the Dáil thinks otherwise I am not going to press it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made by Deputy MacBride and, I think, Deputy Kyne that a complaint against a doctor might be the subject of discussion. I cannot imagine that coming up at this advisory committee.  If a man has a complaint against a doctor, he is not looking for advice.  He will make the complaint and that complaint may be made at the county council meeting as it has always been made, where it will get whatever publicity it deserves.  If a complaint is made at a county council meeting it is usually conveyed to the Minister for Health, and even if it is not made at the county council meeting it is made by letter, as I frequently get complaints. If there is any substantiation at all for a complaint it is investigated. Deputies will understand that we sometimes get very frivolous complaints and a very cursory examination shows that they are not worth pursuing.  If there is any substantiation for a complaint it is fully investigated. I do not see at all what function this advisory committee would have with a complaint against a doctor.  They are an advisory committee. Certainly they will criticise the system.  That is a different matter. Deputy MacBride gave the example of, let us say, poor food in an institution. The advisory committee might advise that the food should be varied or improved and notice would have to be taken of such a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not illustrate the kind of difficulty there is bound to be between the county <Col N="932" /> medical officer of health and the county surgeon and the manager? Would not the county surgeon or the county medical officer of health be slow to make a finding which might reflect on the county manager's capabilities in providing decent food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what difference it makes whether the medical officer of health is a member of the advisory committee or not.  I think Deputies should keep this in mind. We have heard speeches of Deputies who have experience of health authority work and the general opinion amongst these Deputies is that things go smoothly, that the county manager and the officers concerned are anxious to consult with local authority representatives and discuss matters with them.  That being the case, we should provide for the great majority of cases. What we should have in mind is a group that is out really to improve matters if improvement is necessary, and I suppose it is necessary everywhere. They have no other object in view but to improve matters.</P>
      <P>I come now to the question of publicity. You are very much more likely to get good work without the Press being present.  First of all the members who are present may be friends of the county surgeon or of the county manager.  They would like to make some criticism of what is going on but they might say: &ldquo;I have a criticism to make, but, seeing that the Press is here, I will wait until the meeting is over.&rdquo;  If the Press is absent they will refer to the matter and the county manager and the county medical officer of health will discuss it in a friendly manner.  If there is any justification for the complaint it will be remedied, or if there is a good case made for the advice tendered, that advice will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a great mistake to hold these meetings in the presence of the Press.  What I have in mind is a number of people who are friendly disposed to one another and anxious to get things improved, if improvement is necessary.  I had not in mind at all hostile groups coming together and looking for the Press to be present in <Col N="933" /> order to publish their grievances, whatever they may be.  Therefore, I would certainly drop this amendment completely rather than allow any such sub-section because any good that is in the amendment would be destroyed if the Press were present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne's point was a very good one.  He was afraid that if a man on the county council has a complaint against an official, whether it is the county manager, the dispensary doctor, or anyone else, on the health side, of course, the county council would be inclined to say: &ldquo;Raise that at the advisory health committee.&rdquo;  In the first place, he may not be a member of that committee, there being only four of the county council members represented. Even if he is he can well say: &ldquo;I do not want to give advice at all: I want to make a complaint.&rdquo;  I do not see how it can be ruled out if he wants to make it.  It is a separate matter and it should be done at the county council meeting as it was always done.  Here we are dealing with a committee which is there to advise and, if you like, to advise in a friendly way without hostile elements being brought together. Therefore, I am entirely in favour of the meeting being held <i>in camera,</i> that is, in the absence of the Press.</P>
    <P>Some of the members opposite, Deputy General Mulcahy and Deputy MacBride, were members of a Government. I am sure that at some of those Government meetings they had differences of opinion and they may have criticised one another.  It happens with all Governments.  When they come in here and the Press is present they do not criticise one another.  If the Press were present at a Cabinet meeting it would be very hard to carry on.</P>

Is not it obvious that you will get better work done if the Press is absent?</P>
      <P>I can understand the mentality of Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Mulcahy because they cannot get away from the mentality of making political capital every time they can and you cannot make political capital unless the Press is present.  Therefore, as far as they are concerned, a private meeting of any kind is no use to them and they would always advocate that the Press should be present.  Let them try to put their minds down to this for once in their lives, that we want work done, not publicity, not political capital.  We want advice, and the best advice, given.  If they could look at it from that point of view, they would not press to have the meetings held publicly.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there are two main functions that these committees will discharge.  One will be to do the planning work, the private type of work that the Minister has just referred to.

It is in regard to the investigation of complaints that I think they should be permitted to hold their meetings publicly.  I would leave that discretion to them.</P>

Suppose the members say: &ldquo;We hear that the food <Col N="935" /> in a particular institution is bad, that there is no variety and that it could be improved without increasing the cost&rdquo;, the manager or the county surgeon may say: &ldquo;Investigate it for yourselves.  I have no objections&rdquo;. That is the type of investigation they might do.  In other words it would be a sort of visiting committee.  It would not be a formal investigation.  I do not see that they will ever come to the point of making a formal investigation. For instance, if there is a serious complaint against a doctor they would never investigate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the introduction of this section will be a definite improvement to the Bill.  I would draw the Minister's attention to sub-section (5):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where meetings of a consultative health committee have been held on six or more days in any year, no further meeting shall be held in that year save at the request by resolution of the council of the county or at the request of, or with the consent of, the county manager.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should make that obligatory and have definite meetings primarily, leaving to the council the discretion as to the dates, which could coincide with meetings of the county council.  This is leaving a rather wide gate and giving rather more power to the consultative council, or the majority of them, than they would really be entitled to, if it is intended that this consultative council as constituted is to be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see in the administration of this Health Bill problems and difficulties arising such as we have in connection with the administration of the ordinary health services.  I am not a bit perturbed with regard to the powers we are getting under this Bill. I believe it will work out satisfactorily. There should be a definite date fixed for these meetings.  I would like the Minister to explain, having regard to the inclusion in the sub-section of the words: &ldquo;... six or more days in any year, no further meeting shall be held in that year ...&rdquo; how we are to <Col N="936" /> decide what other meetings shall be held in addition to the six referred to.  I think the Minister would be well advised in making that specific.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister for Health, in being as naïve as he is to-day, instinctively arouses suspicion in my mind.  His arguments in support of his contention, even on his own admission, are, to put it mildly, more than attenuated.  To discuss on an analogous basis executive functions and advisory functions is slightly unworthy of the Minister at this stage of the debate.  The issues involved in this amendment are clearly knit.  The Minister says in a noncommittal way that it does not make any difference whether the county medical officer or the county surgeon is a member of the board or not when he is sitting with the board.  That argument is typical of the suspicious type of naïveté that the Minister is cloaking himself with to-day.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that you are putting on an advisory council the chief executive officers for the discharge of the health services of the county.  I cannot see that they would not be more effective in their executive capacity to advise and help such a council rather than as members of it, particularly when one adverts to the point already raised by Deputy Kyne and Deputy Corish that it is more than likely in the normal circumstances of meeting of this council, that the officials would be the regular attenders and, in many cases, under the quorum laid down for the council, would be making the decisions.  It is to protect against that kind of extended officialdom that most people argue against the inclusion of permanent officials of the county council on the advisory committee. The Minister would want to weigh that rather deliberately instead of looking upon it as something of no consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to our experience of county council administration, there is no doubt that with the establishment of this body there will be a tendency to divert more and more of the problems arising from the administration of <Col N="937" /> health services in the county to this consultative council for investigation and decision.</P>
    <P>I, myself, would not accept at its face value the suggestion from the Minister that they would not deal with complaints.  I feel that the natural tendency will be with their specialised type of terms of reference to refer matters even by way of complaint to this body for advice on.  It is true that the Minister may argue that they are purely advisory, but in the ultimate analysis the decision of this council by way of advice or otherwise will be implemented and in this case may have to be implemented by the very members of the advisory council itself.  Let us be reasonable in our argument on the issue.  The Minister very quietly and seemingly innocuously tried to draw an analogy between a Government meeting and a meeting of this advisory committee and then he goes on to a beautiful extension of the argument to suggest that these meetings may be a body of friends meeting and if the Press were present they would not be inclined to say: &ldquo;Well, so-and-so, you have done wrong&rdquo;.  I do not think that that argument in fact is a real argument at all.  I do not think that where there is a question of complaint by somebody who is friendly, as suggested by the Minister, with the county manager or the county surgeon he could raise it at that committee in a public way.  He would inevitably have resort to the type of after-meeting discussion that the Minister himself adverted to in his argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to justify exclusion of the Press on the basis of people seeking political advantage or political gain by virtue of these meetings. If the advisory council, in fact, as envisaged by the Minister is to be effective at all the Press may be the the best medium by which to achieve that object, for the simple reason that there in a dispassionate way on purely factual statement and on purely factual investigation you will have a collective objective mind brought to a problem and it might well be that the service the Press would give to that body would ultimately enhance its prospects of success because things <Col N="938" /> discussed by them could readily be effectively observed if they were running in any way contra to the wishes of the county manager or of his principal officials.  If the Press is there as the custodian of the public opinion and there to deliberate in the forum of its circulation the type of discussion that was carried on by this advisory body it might prove a very effective weapon to break down walls of red tape and the effective cloak that officialdom can put on difficult problems or on unpleasant remedies.</P>
    <P>I am not at all convinced in any way by the Minister's argument.  I think we are not approaching this whole problem in the best interests of either the health service itself or efficiency in its administration.  The theory and concept of an advisory council is an excellent one, but let us take a more reasonable line of argument than, should I say, the uncorrelated analogies attempted by the Minister. If this advisory council is, in fact, going to have paid officials of the council itself as part of the advisory body, who will it advise?  Their function is to advise the county manager, and in the delegated powers that the county manager delegates, to advise the county medical officer and the county surgeon as to what would be best to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the county manager a paid official?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but I am dealing with the people who will in fact be exercising his delegated powers, and when it comes to a question of administration in either any branch of the health service or any of its institutions the responsibility does not directly fall in the accepted sense on the county manager.  The person who in the real issue is going to be the person in the dock or the person in jeopardy is in many cases the medical officer who we might argue in another place was not the authority at all.  There is the situation in logical argument that even if it is nominally to the county manager the advice is tendered, in fact nobody would know better than Deputy Dr. Browne himself that the implementation and ultimate <Col N="939" /> carrying out of the advice and directive will be in the hands of either the medical officer or the county surgeon or maybe some other medical officer of the county delegated by him to perform specific functions.  You have that kind of double-headed penny where these paid officials of the council in their professional capacity will be advisers to themselves in their administrative professional capacity within the council.  I do not think that that is a happy state of conception for any such council.  I do not think it is going to leave them free to do the best work possible.  I think from the point of view of the county surgeon and the county medical officer himself they would be better off to come in as people in command of the facts and the knowledge of what is going on in their county, to lay facts and figures before the advisory council for their objective analysis as distinct from becoming participants themselves in the particular deliberations.  They will achieve, I would say, a better and a more useful function in that way than they would by actual membership of the council.</P>
      <P>It goes a little further than that when the Minister deals with the exclusion of the Press.  I think he is not dealing with it on a realistic basis. There is an instinctive suspicion created around that type of body, whether you call it an advisory consultative council or a commission of investigation or anything else, where it becomes something behind sealed doors having a more or less furtive type of gathering, it creates not the best possible atmosphere for the development of any suggested scheme or the improvements that may be suggested by such consultative body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are circumstances in which one could conceive that it would be necessary to exclude the Press, but surely it would be wiser for the Minister to allow that function to be operated by the council itself as distinct from laying down as a direction to them the necessity for completely excluding the Press. I think the Minister would be well advised to consider possibly vesting in the consultative council itself the right <Col N="940" /> to decide on any issue whether or not the Press will be present, and to put the onus of exclusion on them rather than, as I have suggested, making it a condition precedent to their meetings that the Press must be excluded.</P>

      <P>A State grant of £100,000, or one-third of the cost, whichever is the less, has been allocated to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners for harbour improvement works.  A grant of £50,000, or half the cost, whichever is the less, is also being made towards the purchase of a dredger.  It is not correct to say that these projects have been held up because the Government financial assistance promised is not forthcoming. On the contrary, seven claims have already been made by the harbour commissioners for instalments of grant and in each case payment was made within a month of the claim being received. All claims received to date have been met.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that applicants for unemployment assistance who have been in receipt of unemployment benefit for a prolonged period have been notified that they must sign for a waiting period of three days before becoming entitled to unemployment assistance; and, if so, and having regard to the fact that such persons have furnished evidence of continuous unemployment which had entitled them to unemployment benefit, he will arrange to dispense with the second waiting period of three days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the waiting period for unemployment assistance was reduced from six days to three days.  A person is disqualified for the receipt of unemployment assistance when in receipt of or entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Unemployment Assistance Acts provide that no time during which a person is disqualified for receiving <Col N="943" /> unemployment assistance shall be reckoned in the computation of any period of unemployment, and for that reason any day for which unemployment benefit is paid or payable cannot be treated as a waiting day for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an unemployed man with a wife and two dependent children, who has been unemployed since last January, will receive only 19/- this week, because of that interpretation of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of it.  That is what the Act lays down, but if the Act had not been passed he would receive only 1/6 instead of 19/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since 1935 that has not been in operation?  When a man has not been in employment for months and the stamp payments are exhausted, he is informed of the position and signs a form and goes on to unemployment assistance the following week, without having to wait a second period of seven days.  That was in operation since 1935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in operation, truly.  Before the last Act the stamp only entitled him to one day's benefit, but now, under the Act just passed, if a man has stamps he can go on drawing for 26 weeks for 26 stamps.  That is what has made the difference.  I know there is hardship and I do not want to defend that, but I want to point out to the Deputy that if the Act had not been passed he would have been on unemployment assistance from the end of January instead of now and certainly he would not benefit by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that this is in operation since 1935.  A man who is getting 50/- a week since last January, who has a wife and two children, is this week getting only 19/-, although when he goes on to next week he can get his 38/- That has not been in operation since 1935.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Before the 1952 Act was passed a person could opt to take unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance and in that way it could be arranged that there would be no waiting period; but when the 1952 Act was brought in which gave the 26 weeks' running period, there was no option.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will indicate the terms of settlement arrived at between him and the dental profession for the provision of dental benefits to insured persons under the Social Welfare Act, and the extent to which the settlement varies the previous agreement with the dental profession and the facilities provided for insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The settlement with the dental profession provides for an overall increase of 8.7 per cent. in the scales of fees which were in operation prior to the suspension of the benefit on 1st April, 1952.  Apart from the increase in fees the settlement does not vary the previous agreement with the profession.  The facilities provided for insured persons include the provision free of cost to them of all forms of dental treatment other than dentures. Due to increases in the costs of providing the treatment benefits, which include dental benefit, and having regard to the necessity of keeping within the limit of the annual expenditure on these benefits imposed by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, insured persons are now required to pay two-thirds of the cost of dentures instead of the half cost they paid for them prior to the suspension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>I take it the Deputy refers to the scheme estimated to cost over £61,000 submitted by the Limerick Corporation for the improvement of approximately 1,500 yards of this road. Expenditure to this extent is not considered necessary, as an alternative scheme, estimated to cost less than £40,000, has been devised which will provide a road of adequate standard.</P>

      <P>There are no plans in respect of immmediately pending housing schemes in Cork City awaiting sanction in my Department.  Revised house plans which Cork Corporation propose to use at a future date in central city areas were received in my Department on the 28th May, 1953.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the ceiling of £37 per acre payable under section B of the land rehabilitation scheme to contractors is not considered economic by them, with the result that there is grave delay in applications being dealt with under section B in Wexford and the adjacent counties by those contractors and if, in view of the mounting waiting list, he will consider increasing the grant so as to expedite outstanding cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Wexford when it is proposed to drain land the Minister's official gives an estimate of what the cost will be under section B and in all cases my information is that it is generally as high as £52 an acre. The contractors are not able to carry <Col N="952" /> out the work economically at a price of £37 per acre and, therefore, the work is not done.  It is passed from section B to section A and the waiting list goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that the average cost for County Wexford is over £50, nor is it true to say that it is over £42.  There has been no reduction as far as the contractors are concerned and it is not going to be as expensive to reclaim land as it has been in the past.  It is really an administrative scheme that we have introduced. We are going to give more land to the contractors to do in future than we have in the past and their profits will not be reduced thereby.  There is no change as far as the contractors are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of limiting it to £37 an acre.  I do not know where the Deputy got that figure. There is no such figure as £37.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inquiring, when the debate was adjourned, as to where the Minister for Finance planned to get the £300,000 to £500,000 which the Minister for Local Government had undertaken to collect from the ratepayers in relief of his Budget now that the Minister for Finance and the Government gave an undertaking to two Independent Deputies to cancel that proposal.  Did the Government tell Deputy Lehane that they were going to adjust the new rate demand so as to relieve the local authorities of the extra £300,000 to £500,000 which it was suggested was going to be levied on them by the alteration of the manner of distribution of the agricultural grant?  Would Deputy Lehane tell us that?  This is important.  Do you remember the beating of bosoms that went on on the Government Benches? <Col N="954" /> They did not consider Deputies Lehane or Sheldon or Cogan.  They threw the vote of confidence on the floor and told them: &ldquo;Take it or leave it.&rdquo;  But it now transpires, according to Deputy Lehane, that he told them that he would abstain from voting unless he was assured that this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is how his undertaking&mdash;now that he has cancelled the additional charge being made on the ratepayers&mdash;is going to be met if the Minister for Finance depended on the relief produced by that manoeuvre to balance his Budget.  I think it is highly likely that the Minister for Finance will not answer because I think he has reached the point of irresponsibility when he does not think there is any obligation on him to answer to Dáil Éireann.  He has come to consider that no matter what he says he can depend on Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and Deputy Cogan to vote where they are told to vote.</P>

I often wonder how long can the Minister for Finance and his friends continue to survive as parasites of this quartet because that is what they are becoming.  Whether the quartet are the parasites of Fianna Fáil or Fianna Fáil the parasites of the quartet the relationship is not very honourable for either party whichever way you take it, and I would submit to such members of the Fianna Fáil Party as still have some regard for the country that for an Irish Government to be in that position grows more embarrassing for everybody with every day that passes.

I think as a result of the by-elections in Wicklow and Cork it is likely that the Minister's intentions were changed in this regard.  I understood that an undertaking had been given to Deputy Lehane, but if I am wrong I gladly take the opportunity of apologising. I was told that the reason he did not vote in either Lobby was that he was told by the Government that they were resolved not to put this imposition on the farmers.</P>

    <P>I now understand that no such undertaking was given to Deputy Lehane, but something has happened <Col N="957" /> because the Minister for Local Government refused to reveal what legislation he intends to bring in although he was very frank in communicating with the secretaries of the county councils what he intended to do.  He has changed his mind for some reason. It is a matter of interest to this House that it was not anything which Deputy Sheldon or Deputy Lehane did that caused the Government to change its mind.  It was the by-elections.  I think we are entitled to learn from the Government and from the Minister for Finance what consequential action he proposes to take now.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to face that accusation if the Minister can prove it.  I want to refer to another matter.  I read to-day a list of articles which the Taoiseach declared he intended to import from dollar sources, and to pay for them with dollars, when he put his hand upon his heart and said that he would not sign this statement or make this agreement if he did not believe that the document presented was an honest document.  I asked the House when perusing the document to turn their attention to page 6 from which I proceeded to read certain figures.  I should have directed the attention of the House to page 8, which is the page on which the proposed imports appear. On page 6, the figures mentioned by me really relate to the total requirements of the country.  The House will remember that in reading these figures I turned to Deputy MacBride and said that there must be some mistake about them.  The mistake is that I read the figures of the total requirements for the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a time when we should mobilise credit and use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to repay it over the next 100 years.  The extension of credit should not deter us from embarking on bold schemes at the present time, always provided that they are good schemes.  As a start in that direction, one good thing would be to build a new Oireachtas, and it would prove to be an economy in the long run.  We are eternally patching and tinkering with these buildings in order to make them adequate to fulfil the functions of an efficient Parliament. It is common knowledge that half the Deputies cannot find accommodation in which to write a letter. Even the Ministers' rooms are inadequate and they have no proper facilities.  We are trying to get our meals in a restaurant which is built on top of the boiler-house and in which no person could sit in the months of August and September. The permanent officials are obliged to sit in cramped quarters up at the <Col N="964" /> top and their teeth are made to chatter with the noises of the machinery in the basement, because we are trying to dislodge a beetle through the medium of a vacuum cleaner in the roof.  I understand that the roof is now infested with beetles and that it shall have to be rebuilt.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am showing the mind and the policy that was behind the indiscriminate borrowing.  That is a statement that was made by Deputy Dillon in this House on the 25th May, 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what beetles or what roof Deputy Dillon was alluding to but, judging by what we heard from him this afternoon, he certainly has bats in his belfry.  In pursuance of that policy of mobilising credit&mdash;&ldquo;use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to repay it over the next 100 years&rdquo;&mdash;those people in 1948 borrowed and they borrowed again and they borrowed again on top of that and they borrowed the fourth time on top of it all.  Unlike Deputy Dillon, I am not going to go back to the dark ages. I will give another little quotation now.  It is from the Official Report of the 23rd April, 1952, Volume 131, column 168.  The heading of the question was &ldquo;State Borrowings&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the total amount of State borrowing (a) in each of the years 1947-48 to 1951-52, inclusive, (b) in the years 1932-33 to 1947-48, inclusive, and (c) in the years 1923-24 to 1931-32, inclusive.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacEntee: The net amounts borrowed for Exchequer purposes in the years mentioned by the Deputy were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) 1947-48, £5,004,500.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, of course, was to fill the Budget blank&mdash;since Deputy Dillon has been talking about the £500,000 Budget deficit there was to be&mdash;which was left <Col N="965" /> by reason of the cheap pint and the cheap cigarettes which Deputies opposite when they came into office gave back to the boys when they reduced the taxes put on beer and cigarettes.  For that purpose, they borrowed £5,004,000 so that for the next 30 years the people of this country will be paying in principal and in interest for the cheap fag and the cheap pint the boys got in 1948.  In 1948-49, the amount borrowed was £8,951,000; in 1949-50, £20,539,000; in 1950-51 £21,686,000; and in 1951-52, £38,938,000. That is a total in borrowing of £94,000,000 odd to run this bit of an island for three and a half years&mdash; £14,000,000 more than the total amount borrowed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and the Fianna Fáil Government in a period of 24 years.  They borrowed £14,000,000 more to run this bit of an island for three and a half years than was borrowed by the two previous Governments to run the country up to the time they came in.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle may ask me how that affects the present financial system.  I will tell the House how it affects it.  At column 167 of the Dáil Debates of that date, there is the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Finance if he will state</P>
    <P>(1) the total amount payable and paid in interest and sinking fund in the financial years 1947-48, and</P>
    <P>(2) the total amount payable in interest and sinking fund in the financial year 1952-53.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied that the figure for interest in 1947-48 was £3,095,714, and in 1952-53, £7,354,700.  For sinking funds, the figures were £1,128,620 in 1947-48, and £2,725,700 for 1952-53.  The total amount that had to be paid in principal and interest for money borrowed over a period of 24 years in 1947-48 was £4,224,334, while the total amount that had to be paid in principal and interest on borrowed money when Deputy MacEntee came back as Minister for Finance was £10,080,400, with the addition this year, I understand, of the first repayment on the Marshall Loan of £1,200,000, which means that £11,200,000 a year must be <Col N="966" /> got by taxation from the people to pay for the spree that Government had here for three and a half years.  We hear Deputies opposite looking for a reduction in the spirit duty and a reduction in the price of the pint, but the total extra amount put on spirits and on the price of the pint would not cover the payment of the interest alone on what they borrowed during the three and a half years they were in office.</P>
    <P>Let us get clear on these things.  We had the same cry the other day in connection with the reduction of the subsidies. I heard the reduction and abolition of subsidies preached in this House before, and I know who the archpriest of that doctrine was.  At column 2048 of Volume 106 of the Dáil Debates of 18th June, 1947, we find Deputy Dillon saying this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum.  How long will that go on? Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world?  Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum?  I want it to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the office of the Minister for Agriculture since Fianna Fáil came into power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is rather a strange statement, but it accounts for a lot.  It accounts for the &ldquo;bob&rdquo; a gallon which Deputy Dillon offered the farmers for their milk, and the resultant reduction of the number of milch cows in the country by 54,000 in 12 months.  As the Deputy said: &ldquo;You cannot produce a calf in a month,&rdquo; and the effects of his activities on the live-stock trade of the country will live for a long time after. That is his first statement, and that was the result of his action.  Then he comes in here and glibly demands to know why the subsidies were taken off. According to him it was sheer insanity to pay a subsidy on butter, or even to <Col N="967" /> produce butter from milk at all.  That was his solemn statement.  I think it was Deputy MacEoin who raised a matter in connection with the building of the new Houses of the Oireachtas on the Adjournment.  Now he knows who got the brainwave&mdash;it was his own Jamesy.</P>

      <P>And filled your position, I am glad to say, with honour.  I would not expect anything else from you.  However, that is one result of the activities of Deputy James Dillon and one of the reasons for our financial position.  I wish Deputies would adopt an entirely different attitude towards these matters&mdash;I think we would do better if we did.  The kind of stuff that was dished out to us to-day is no benefit and no credit to this Dáil or to any House.</P>
      <P>When we see a certain condition of affairs obtaining in regard to agricultural production, we wonder what is the reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish <Col N="968" /> wheat.  Before you ate it you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread.  If it was boot polish you put it on your boots or shoes, and if it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were fit.&rdquo;</P>

The total reduction in the acreage of root crops was 114,162 acres and the total reduction in tillage was 603,000 acres.

      <P>&ldquo;There remains beet&mdash;the blessings of beet! Some day, and in the not far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue the production of sugar from beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That represents at least 200,000 tons of beet.  Think of the amount of employment that will provide.  Think of the 150 Mayo men who were packed, ready to go over to England, but who were brought down to Cork instead and given decent employment there.  They are earning now from £10 to £15 per week and they do not have to eat horse flesh or asses. They get decent Irish meat.  That is one item in the relief of unemployment. Think of the labour content and the money that will be spent in Fitting that 200,000 acres of beet, in conveying it to the factories and in processing it into sugar.  Think of the £3,000,000 that we are keeping here in this country this year for the benefit of the farmer, the farm labourer, C.I.E. <Col N="971" /> and the workers in the sugar factories. That is where Deputy Dillon's policy was wrong&mdash;the man who advised the blowing up of the beet factories as the wisest thing that could be done on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  And then we had the lunacy of putting this man in charge of that industry for three and a half years.</P>

I have very little sympathy, as I said before, for the distilling trade as far as that is concerned.  The distilling industry, so far as I know it, is the industry which purchased barley under price and had to be forced into the courts and made disgorge its unjust profits.  It comes each year now and makes its bargain half a dollar a barrel under the price given by Arthur Guinness.  Two years ago the Grain Growers' Association got back for the farmers of this country over £2,500,000, the difference between 57/6 and 84/- a barrel because the agreement was that the Irish farmer would get for his barley 2/6 a barrel over what any English farmer would get.

      <P>They made £48 an acre on their feeding barley as against £32 10s. from the brewers or the distillers for ten barrels to the acre. Those are facts.  Let us not boast about something that does not occur. Due to the manner in which our Minister for Agriculture has worked the matter out, feeding barley to-day is a better proposition than malting barley for the ordinary farmer of this country who knows his job.  Last year Messrs. Guinness got frightened.  They made a bargain with us in November and last February they changed it.  It cost them 10/- a barrel.  They paid us 10/-a barrel more than the English farmer got this year because of the price we fixed and because we knew what we were doing.  We caught them.  This year they sent for us again.  They said: &ldquo;Look, there is your 2/6 a barrel.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;That is no good.  I want 3/9&rdquo;, and I got the 3/9 a barrel over the British price.</P>

      <P>I have shown what the financial burden is.  We have been told of the money that was left on the table.  Do the Deputies opposite forget what they did?  Do they forget that, even though the arbitration award in regard to the Civil Service was also on the table to the tune of £3,600,000, they made no provision for it?  That will have to come out of the nest egg which they are supposed to have left on the table for the present Minister for Finance.  Do they also forget that they made no provision that year for C.I.E. losses which amounted to £1,800,000?  Are they also aware that, in regard to the fuel subsidy, they left a debt of £2,700,000?  Are they also aware of the letters which <Col N="975" /> were sent out from Departments after the Dáil was dissolved and which put an extra burden on the taxpayers of £875,000?</P>
      <P>We heard a lot here to-day of the £500,000 which is supposed to have been divided between Deputy Cogan for voting for the Government and Deputy Lehane for not voting at all, but we did not hear very much about the £2,800,000 which was dished out to officials of the local authorities, or of the letters that were sent out three days after the Dáil had been dissolved, at a time when the Ministers in those Departments were only in the position of caretakers.</P>
      <P>I think these are facts which will take some answering.  In regard to the letters that were sent out to the local authorities, they are already on record. I do not want to read them again. These were some of the debts that were piled high on the table waiting for Deputy MacEntee to pay off when he came in again as Minister for Finance.  What about the £94,000,000 which the last Government borrowed and the £7,200,000 that will have to be lifted from the people of this country in the form of taxation over the next 50 years to meet interest charges and pay for the last Government's spree?</P>
      <P>I, like every other Deputy, am worried about unemployment conditions in my constituency.  Last week, the Taoiseach invited all Deputies to put forward any proposals they had to make in regard to the relief of unemployment in their areas.  In pursuance of that invitation, I had four questions on the Order Paper this week.  In view of the statements made here by various Deputies with regard to unemployment, I was surprised to see that I was the only Deputy who had accepted the invitation.  I am worried, for instance, as to the position of affairs in Cobh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Finance Bill is to implement in general the budgetary policy of the Government. This year the Finance Bill is virtually a repeat of last year's; therefore, it becomes relevant to discuss two successive years of bludgeoning Government economic stupidity.  I propose, with your permission, Sir, in addressing my remarks to the subject to keep within the rules of relevancy.</P>
      <P>The consequences of the Government's policy are now apparent.  They can be mainly grouped under three headings: a catastrophic rise in unemployment, a disastrous increase in emigration and what one might describe as a general uncertainty and uneasy depression in trade, business, and various types of economic endeavour within the State.</P>
      <P>With the glorious naïveté that sometimes he can achieve, the Taoiseach in the recent vote of confidence brushed aside the question of rising unemployment on the basis of appealing to the House to put in schemes that will give employment and that they will be dealt with on their merits.  It is poor consolation indeed to the people who in an effort to impress their dire economic distress on the country are having to resort to forced marches, sit down strikes on main thoroughfares and other methods of focussing attention on their plight in the main within the city.</P>
      <P>I am not one who would purport to say in this House that there was an easy solution to the unemployment problem but I cannot see how an economic policy of a Government that increases taxation&mdash;to use the very expression of the Taoiseach himself&mdash; to its limit and leaves the people under a staggering burden, can be calculated to arrest rising unemployment, or how the Government can expect initiative and effort from people with capital to speculate, people with business to expand, in the situation of increased taxation and of curtailment of purchasing power of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot fathom the purpose behind all this, a situation deliberately created by the Government where more and more money is being forced <Col N="978" /> out of circulation by virtue of the fact that the ever-grasping hand of revenue is after it.  There is no substantial compensation given to the community for the direct action of a Government that increased the cost of living by not less than 17 points.  There is no commensurate compensation in earning capacity for that.  Do you expect in that situation, a people over-taxed, with the cost of consumer goods 17 per cent. higher than heretofore, to face anything but depression?  Let the Government face the reality of the situation and they will find that if they want a cure for unemployment and emigration, the cure is in their own hands.  The stimulus that is necessary to the people is not an as-you-were policy with regard to taxation. Continuing this burden described as staggering by various members of the Government for a further year is hardly the way to encourage people to go out after expansion, increased production and, as a consequence, increased employment.</P>
    <P>I say to the Taoiseach and his Government that there is a simple solution to part of their unemployment problem if the Minister for Finance has the courage to call in the various people engaged in industry here, discuss with them where tax reliefs will enable them to expand, to improve conditions of employment and, even if it may be termed a type of bribe, let tax alleviation and compensatory tax reliefs go to people who are prepared in the situation of national difficulty to expand in a reasonable way the amount of employment they are giving.  It is better to have people in employment in industry which is expanding by virtue of tax concessions and tax reliefs than to have growing queues in the unemployment exchanges and ever-increasing queues to the emigrant ship.  As I have said too often in this House, the emigrant we lose particularly in the initial stages of manhood or womanhood in the formative years of 18 to 21, is a loss that we can count as permanent because the number that ever returns is virtually nil, especially of those that return as useful citizens.  People may say that some will return but, in the main, the boy and girl who leave <Col N="979" /> Ireland in the initial stages of their career, if they come back, will only do so at a ripe old age to live out the autumn of their lives in their homeland.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill gives us a real opportunity of reviewing what Government financial policy has been responsible for.  The whole design of the Government's financial policy has been to create an atmosphere of uncertainty, depression in business, and so on.  As far as that is concerned, we see the immediate consequences in the meteoric rise in unemployment and in the ever-growing flow of emigration. Incidentally, things that arise in regard to the tax levied here fit into the over-all picture, too.  Let us look at what the over-all picture is and do not let us delude ourselves for a moment.  Unemployment at its extraordinarily high figure is a stark reality as is emigration with its ever-increasing flow.  Nobody in this House, no matter how devoted and loyal a follower of the chief he may be, will deny that the general state of trade and commerce throughout the length and breadth of the country is infinitely worse to-day than it was two years ago since fortuitous circumstances allowed the present inept Administration to take control.</P>
    <P>There is more in this discussion than the bludgeoning impact of this tax on various trades.  It seems extraordinary that a Minister for Finance, the one and only Deputy Seán MacEntee, can to-day defend, with typical political adroitness, the imposition of the taxes on beer and spirits in the light of his Rathmines speech on the eve of a general election when, with political acumen, he sought to quell the ever-increasing rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power there would be a return to the taxes of the 1947 Supplementary Budget.  To assure everybody that that was not so, apart from what Deputy Seán Lemass had to say, Deputy MacEntee as he was then, said there was no foundation whatever for such a rumour.</P>
    <P>He had not well warmed the seat in his office in the Department of Finance when that was recanted and the people <Col N="980" /> in the distilling industry and the licensed trade found that the only truth that was not in the rumour was that it was not going to be the 1947 tax but a new and increased bludgeon which the Minister had conceived in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The situation is that one particular type of trade has suffered a staggering body blow from the caprice of a slightly indignant Minister who realised that the 1947 Budget had been a mistake, but was now going to give a salutary lesson to the Irish people for deigning to say that it had been wrong by hitting them infinitely harder when the opportunity presented itself.  That is the background and pattern of that particular facet of the taxation that this Finance Bill imposed.</P>
    <P>It goes a lot deeper than that.  We have to view this matter in the light of the opinion that has been expressed by the Irish people since the full impact of the reduction of subsidies has been felt, since the full effect of the hair shirt policy of this Government, this austerity type of economy, has been felt by the people, in the light of the successive clamour of North-West Dublin, Limerick, East Cork and Wicklow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us face the issue. This Finance Bill does no more than continue the stupidity of last May 12 months.  The Government, clinging as it is, like a limpet, to the last vestige that gives power, patronage and privilege, must wake up and realise that an opportunity was presented to the Irish people to adjudge that policy in its full effect in North-West Dublin, Wicklow and East Cork.  It was not until these by-elections that the removal of the subsidies, the raid on the cupboards of the householders and the impact of the various taxes were felt by the Irish people.  The moment that became a <Col N="981" /> reality, at each successive opportunity the people in these constituencies, a city constituency, an East coast constituency and a South-East coast constituency, representing a very fair cross-section of the general public, gave a salutary answer and expressed what they think of Government economic policy.</P>
      <P>They do not believe and we do not believe that it was necessary to adopt that policy in this country, credit-worthy as it is.  The Irish Republic, thanks be to God, is one of the greatest creditor nations, one of the most financially sound nations in the world to-day.  We do not believe that any Government is entitled to indulge in an economic policy that is based on false premises, that is forcing more and more Irish people into the ranks of the unemployed and more and more Irish boys and girls out of the country. We are strengthened in that belief by the effective answer given by the Irish people in the trials of strength we have had since the full impact of that economic policy has come to bear upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Government is in earnest about arresting depression, unemployment and emigration it has either of two solutions.  The first and most effective one would be to get out. There is every indication that they do not propose to do that.  The second solution, which I give to the Fianna Fáil Government for what it is worth, is that the Minister for Finance should confer with his revenue experts and he will be able to find, through the medium of certain tax concessions, a way to stimulate initiative in industry and to encourage development that will give increased industrial employment forthwith.  Having done that, he can proceed to discussions with responsible people in the Board of Works, the Land Commission, Fisheries, and various other Departments operating schemes of development throughout Ireland.  He will find an immense variety of useful practical schemes, from breakwaters and piers to river clearance and various types of State-aided industry, as adjuncts to fishing, into which to put solid money which will create employment for people <Col N="982" /> where it is needed most, in rural Ireland. In that way we could put a brake on the ever-growing exodus from rural Ireland into the cities that is swelling unemployment queues in the cities and the ever-increasing flow of people out of the land altogether.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill gives us an opportunity to look at the picture as we now see it.  As I said before&mdash;and I am not going to delay the House inordinately at this stage of the Bill, as I feel sure the House is anxious to dispose of it to-day&mdash;looking at the picture now it is a sorry one compared with one of a country geared for effort, people going more and more each month into employment, and productivity on the land increasing month by month.  That was the picture we could look at only two years ago.  To-day we look at a picture the background of which is haunted by the three most miserable spectres that can affect any Government&mdash;the scowl of unemployment in one corner, the growl of emigration in another, and the general gloom of growing depression as a background to the two.  That is a tribute to the inept, ill-conceived, ill-judged, bludgeoning financial policy that this Government has succeeded in forcing on this country, and in two years reducing it to a country in which even the people in steady and effective employment are getting restless to the extent of trying to find other lands to which to emigrate, themselves and their complete families, where they feel there will be stability and security in some new country.  It is a terrible travesty of the sacrifices made that this should be a free, independent country, that an Irish Government reduced to such a state the general morale of the people.  People may think it is an exaggeration, but if the Government does not do something quickly to expand employment at home and effectively put into operation schemes to give work to the people who want work and are clamouring for work, they will find that the labour troubles and the difficulties already being created by unemployed men seeking work in this country are only in their initial stages, and they will willy-nilly leave this country a breeding ground for many worse evils, if <Col N="983" /> they do not adopt some practical policy of amelioration and get to work at the job of finding decent employment for people of Irish origin and Irish descent at home in their own country.</P>
    <P>This Government is too complacent about the present situation.  The Taoiseach by-passes it, the Minister for Finance sneers at it, and his interest in unemployment is purely at the moment a question of the cut and thrust of Party politics.  It is time that this House, dealing as it is with this finance measure, realised that we have a collective responsibility as distinct from Governments or Parties or anything else, to ensure as rapidly as possible that we undo the unrest and unease and general lack of trust and confidence that is growing in the Irish people.  It can only be done by the Government acting with an effectiveness that will give boys and girls the realisation that there is a future at home and that it is not necessary for them to become once more part of the new emigrant stream, who may not only take with them their own young and bright lives but may also take with them the hope of this country, suffering as it is at the moment from falling birth-rate, inordinately high rates of unmarried people and falling population generally.  It may be in this very hour and this very age that we will by our ineptitude in this Dáil and by our lack of appreciation of the critical situation that is arising generally for the Irish people, ultimately carry the responsibility in this 14th Dáil of being the people who in a critical period allowed such an exodus from Ireland as made it impossible for the rehabilitation and re-establishment of this State in its full virile youthful exuberance.  We may find ourselves answering to posterity ultimately for a failure to be able to keep a reasonable proportion of Irish boys and girls at home in Ireland.  I say to the Minister for Finance that the time has come for him to recant the hair-shirt economy and to view the situation as it really is, and not to view it on the basis of &ldquo;dot, dash, plus one or plus two&rdquo;&mdash; view it on the basis of the human misery and suffering that has resulted for this country from his economic <Col N="984" /> policy, and have the courage to undo that and no matter what the economic theorists may say have the courage to end as quickly as possible the ever increasing load of human sorrow and misery that this type of hair-shirt policy is inflicting indiscriminately on all sections of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I rise in this debate mainly to try, as they say in America, to put the records right and not to allow Deputy Dillon to get away with it either in this House or in the country.  At attempt was made by him here to-day to share responsibility for the Marshall Aid borrowing by himself and his colleagues with the Party on this side of the House.  Mind you, it is only quite recently that this change of policy has come about in the opposite benches.  We were told till quite recently what a wonderful thing this borrowing under Marshall Aid was both for the nation and for our people individually, but now that the time has come to pay the piper, now that the people of this State, through this Budget and the preceding Budget, have got to pay the piper and to put right the financial consequences of the borrowings of Deputy Dillon and his colleagues, the boys on the opposite benches have considered that the time is ripe to try to put over on this side of the House some of the blame that is now coming back to them, trying to pass over some of the chickens that have now come home to roost on the Fine Gael Benches to this side of the House.  Of course, to do that and to do it well, they had to get the greatest illusionist sitting on those benches. There was a man in this country called &ldquo;The Great Bamboozlem&rdquo; and he was certainly an excellent illusionist; and in order to create this illusion here to-day Deputy Dillon was brought into this House to carry on for hours putting this particular construction on a document, a query and a reply to it which was sent to our Government by the organisation known as the O.E.E.C., to try to suggest that the reply of our Government to the query that was sent by O.E.E.C. on the 23rd July, 1947, constituted, in effect, in some peculiar twist of Deputy Dillon's imagination, a request for Marshall <Col N="985" /> Aid by this State.  Now I think that nobody in the House but Deputy Dillon would have the neck to try to put the interpretation on this query and on the reply to this query that he has attempted in this House to-day; but in order to keep the records right, I intend to quote from this document that he has been waving around in this House to-day, and to quote the portions of it that Deputy Dillon deliberately refrained from quoting.</P>
      <P>In the first place, let Deputy Dillon be clear that the committee of O.E.E.C. was set up to take stock of the position of all countries in Europe at that particular time, round about June or July of 1947.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of finding out what was the position in each of the European countries a query was addressed to every European democracy that joined in that organisation asking them for a balance sheet of their national affairs as far as productivity was concerned and so far as their needs were concerned.  This document that Deputy Dillon was quoting from here to-day was not all of a sudden compiled by the Irish Government of its own volition at the time. This document was in answer to a query sent to the Irish Government by the O.E.E.C. organisation.  The same query was sent to this country as was sent to all those other democracies, in Europe and elsewhere, some of whom did not even apply for or avail of Marshall Aid.  Deputy Dillon challenged me to name any of these European nations.  Neither Switzerland nor Sweden, both members of this organisation, either asked for Marshall Aid or borrowed any money under it. They got the same query as we got and they sent the balance sheet and estimates that we sent, in accordance with their own economic resources.  What Deputy Dillon refused to read or to quote to the House was from the first, second, third and fourth paragraphs of this draft questionnaire which was prepared by the O.E.E.C. and sent to us <Col N="986" /> on the 23rd July, 1947.  The first paragraph of it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In accordance with O.E.E.C./12/ paragraphs 2 and 3&mdash;reports to be provided by each country should include a short statement of the efforts made up to date, of the contributions made by each country to the reconstruction of other countries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer to that query would not be for the purpose of borrowing or for the purpose of seeking aid from anybody. It went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In regard to national programmes for the period 1947 to 1951, inclusive, each country should give a brief account of its production plans for those years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It asked for the plans of the countries for the years mentioned, and continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition, the annexed questionnaire should be completed.  Its purpose is to secure detailed information which will enable the committee to draw up a balance sheet of resources and requirements in respect of the most important items of agricultural produce, foodstuffs and means of production for the participating countries as a whole.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This particular query refers not alone to the United States, from which came substantial Marshall Aid, but it also refers to those other countries which constitute an important element in international trade.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is essential that countries should ensure that all other commodities not specifically included in this questionnaire are included by them in the balance sheet which they will be submitting to the Committee of Cooperation for the purpose of a study of over-all balance of payments problems.</P>
      <P>In respect of export surpluses, countries should distinguish between that part available for export to all participating countries and that part available for all countries not participating in the Committee of Co-operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5 contains a reference that Deputy Dillon refused to quote at all, when these estimates were read out in Dáil Éireann.  This was the falsehood by which Deputy Dillon wanted to put over on this House and on the country that this document had something to do with Marshall Aid:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The information asked for in the attached tables should be expressed in tonnages only in so far as category A is concerned but in quantity and estimated value for category B in tables III and IV. These estimated values should be based on prices ruling on the 1st July, 1947, f.o.b. or f.o.r. in the countries of origin for export surpluses and in the principal supplying countries for import requirements. Values should be expressed in United States dollars at the official rates of exchange ruling on 1st July, 1947.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These countries were asked to estimate not alone their requirements but also the surpluses which might be available to help other countries, through this organisation. This is the reply to this document. The particulars are given, the estimates are given, both of our requirements and of our surpluses.  This is the document that Deputy Dillon tries to put over on this House, to involve us in some way as being responsible for the Marshall Aid borrowing he and his colleagues did.  These are the facts and all the ballyhoo, all the illusions created round about this document, will not get away from those facts.</P>
      <P>At that time we gave those particulars the same as the other two countries I have referred to, Switzerland and Sweden, which did not in fact apply for Marshall Aid and did not avail of it.  They certainly did not wish to have the millstone of Marshall Aid borrowing around the necks of their people, as Deputy Dillon and his colleagues did when in office.  I often wonder why Deputy Dillon and his colleagues fell for the borrowing.  I often wonder why otherwise reasonable and sensible men should not realise that the party who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing, and that the time would come when the Irish people would be bled white, as they are now bled white, to pay back for the borrowing. This may be a six-marker for Deputy Dillon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get it, if he has the patience to wait.  He knows quite well that the policy of this country and of the Government, before it had the misfortune to fall into the hands of himself and his colleagues, was to pay its way and that, as regards our need for dollars at that time and long before the Deputy started borrowing, we were entitled as a matter of right to draw our needs of dollars out of the dollar pool used by the British.  At that time we had approximately £500,000,000 or more in sterling in Britain, tied up there as a result of the fact that they could not <Col N="989" /> pay us in goods during the war years. We had that money there earned by our feeding them during the war years. Our policy then and up to the time of the change of Government was a successful policy.  It was a policy recognised by the British, that we were entitled to draw from the dollar pool against the balances that we had there.</P>
      <P>It was only when Deputy Dillon and his colleagues went over to the late Sir Stafford Cripps that there seemed to be a sudden change in the policy of this country.  As far as this dollar pool was concerned and as regards our necessity to borrow dollars from anybody at all, the dollars were there and we were entitled to them.  Why, then, was it necessary for Deputy Dillon and his colleagues to put this millstone of borrowed dollars under Marshall Aid round the necks of the people?  Was it a fact that there was a change&mdash;I am only surmising myself but I would like to know&mdash;that the late Sir Stafford Cripps put it over on Deputy Dillon, as being an old friend of the British people, that he should ask the Irish Government now not to draw on the British dollar pool and ask them instead to borrow under Marshall Aid?</P>
      <P>There must be some reason why these men, instead of insisting on this nation's rights in sharing the dollars they were entitled to share out of the British pool as against our balance built up there, were driven to borrow from the United States at a cost which the Irish people have now to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like Deputy Dillon or some of his colleagues to answer that question. I should like to hear why these men did not avail of the dollars that we were entitled to out of the British pool and why they plunged our country into debt by borrowing under the Marshall Aid provisions.  Deputy Dillon is a great man in scaling the peaks of the imagination.  He is only second to Sherpa Tensing in scaling peaks.  In most of the flights of fancy he indulges in he tries to suggest that this side of the House had a share of the responsibility for the borrowing that he and his colleagues did, but he will have to produce more tangible evidence than <Col N="990" /> this document by which, in his most flagrant way, he tried to mislead the House and the people.</P>

The only issue which was put before the then Government as a consequence of that speech was whether we, like the other 16 countries who eventually participated in the O.E.E.C.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether we would join with the other 16 countries who eventually did form the O.E.E.C. and would agree to become members of that organisation.  That was the only issue which was raised and dealt with by the Irish Government in June and July, 1947.  There was never at that time any proposal before the Government for the raising of a loan or <Col N="991" /> for the request of a grant.  We were mainly concerned with this issue, whether it would be in the best interests of the Irish people and of humanity as a whole that we should pool our resources with the rest of Europe in order to enable devastated Europe to rebuild itself and to resume its normal social and economic life. That was the only issue which the Government were called upon in July of 1947 to determine and which they did determine.  As a country with ancient and historic associations with the Continent of Europe, we did decide that we who owed so much to these European countries in the past, having been spared by Providence from the ravages of war, would co-operate to the utmost extent of our disposable resources with these wasted regions and help them to reconstruct their social and economic life.  That was the purpose for which the Minister for Agriculture, as he was then, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were sent to Paris, to signify that, though we were on the very outermost fringe of Europe, we here in Ireland regarded ourselves as good Europeans.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, went to the opening session of the Paris conference as Ireland's principal delegate he made a speech which I do not propose to quote at length but from which I think I may quote some passages of very great pertinence to the statements which Deputy Dillon has made.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland gladly welcomed the initiative of the British and the French Governments in proposing a conference of European States to take the first steps in a co-ordinated effort to European recovery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has made great play here with the fact that the then Toaiseach visited the British Embassy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In September.  Of course we are very closely associated with the economic life of Great Britain, as Great Britain is very <Col N="992" /> closely associated with our economic life, and jointly, we were and are very closely concerned with the whole problem of economic recovery in Europe. Both countries buy a great deal from Europe.  Both countries export either directly or indirectly in very great measure to Europe, and it was our concern as well as theirs that the economic recovery of Europe should be expedited by any joint effort which we could make.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, referred to the fact that we welcomed the initiative of the British and French Governments in proposing a conference of European nations.  We were entitled to make that statement having regard to the fact that it was the British and French Governments which took the initiative in trying to assemble a European conference following the speech made by General Marshall, and we have nothing to be ashamed of or nothing to apologise for in the fact that we followed, with other European countries to which I have referred and whose names I will retail in a moment, the initiative which was taken by the British and French Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, let us be quite clear now, we must get at least the nomenclature right.  The Marshall Plan was a proposal to put the economic resources of the United States behind European recovery. What was involved in the French and British initiative of July was this: The setting up of an organisation for European economic co-operation Now, there is a very great difference between them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The development of a co-ordinated plan,&rdquo; said Mr. Lemass, &ldquo;for the restoration of full productivity in Europe generally and the expansion of international trade facilitated by confidence in the stability of political and economic conditions is essential to the prosperity of all European countries, including our own.  That is why we are glad to participate in the work of this conference.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was not in the borrowing arrangements of this conference&mdash;for there were none&mdash;but in the general work of this conference which ultimately manifested itself in what might be described as a comprehensive survey of economic conditions in Western Europe with the idea of ascertaining what the overall deficit or current deficiency in economy might happen to be.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will be prepared,&rdquo; went on Mr. Lemass, &ldquo;to consider any proposals which may emerge from the deliberations of the conference as to how we can most effectively ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, mark, we have been told this was a borrowing conference, that it was a sort of beggars' conclave, according to <Col N="994" /> Deputy Dillon, but this is how the Minister for Industry and Commerce then regarded the tasks of the conference and defined them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will be prepared to consider any proposals which may emerge from the deliberations of the conference as to how we can most effectively increase our contribution to the pool of European resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the questionnaire which was sent to us in July and returned initialled, as Deputy Dillon has told the House, by the then Taoiseach, was in order to enable the organisation as a whole to assess the extent to which we would be able to increase over the years from 1947 to 1951 or 1952, how we would be able to increase our contribution to the pool of European resources; and it had nothing whatever to do with the three subsequent transactions entered into by my immediate predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, when he signed three promissory notes borrowing $128,000,000 from the Export and Import Bank of America.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I can undertake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that, within the limits of our resources we will make the maximum effort to help.  We believe that the conference is beginning on the right lines in recognising that each State is the proper judge of the nature and extent of the contribution it can make.  The strongest associations are those that are free. Of our own free decision and in our own interests, we have come here to gain greater strength and wider opportunity to build up our own economy in the secure environment of a properous Europe.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;is recognised as a primary duty and no more aid is sought than is absolutely necessary if the damage of the war years is to be repaired within a reasonable time and the nations of Western Europe restored to a position in which they can provide for their own needs and preserve their traditional civilisation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> Is it not quite obvious that that sentence was directed to the conditions prevailing in devastated Europe and not to the conditions of comparative peace and plenty prevailing here in Ireland at that time?  The statement continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The manner in which the members of the Committee of Co-operation and the Technical Committees have devoted themselves to their work is beyond praise.  They have compressed into a few months an effort which ordinarily might have extended over years.  Their report is a model of presentation.  It can be read and understood by every citizen. The advice and inspiration of our American friends has been invaluable.</P>
    <P>I would like to express our deep appreciation of what has been accomplished. The work we are doing to-day is good work.  I pray that it may have a prosperous issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement which Deputy Dillon used in his mischievous and malicious effort to try to confuse the minds of the Irish people by making them believe that the transactions which took place in Paris in July, 1947, were the same sort of transactions as those which Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, entered into with the Export and Import Bank of Washington in October, 1948, in February, 1949, and in December, 1949, when he signed three promissory notes under which $128,000,000 of Marshall Loan was borrowed by the then Government and spent before the last promissory note was signed.  They had already, in fact, begun spending these dollars in April, 1948.  The first dollars secured under the promissory note of the 20th October, 1948, went to recoup the British sterling pool for transactions which had been entered into in April, 1948.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Mulcahy this morning talk about the Minister for Finance being subservient to British Government policy.  Let me put on record the actual facts in regard to this Marshall Loan transaction.  On the 8th June, 1948, the question as to <Col N="999" /> whether loan accommodation would be sought in Washington in respect to the current quarter was submitted to the then Government.  When that submission was made, the then Minister for External Affairs was very strenuously opposed to the loan being sought.  On the 11th June, 1948, the Government decided that no loan for the current quarter should be accepted and that future quarters should be considered on the facts.  No further action was taken to look for a loan; but on the 17th June, 1948, discussions began in London.  Negotiations began in London for a renewal or continuance of the 1947 Trade Agreement or an extension of the agreement of 1947. These negotiations continued until the 22nd June, 1948.  When the mass delegation&mdash;I do not think any Minister in the inter-Party or Coalition Government was left at home during the period when these negotiations were proceeding in London in June, 1948&mdash; came back from London, whether it was a mere coincidence or whether it was the result of gentle pressure and persuasion put upon them by the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, the late Sir Stafford Cripps, on the 25th June, 1948, just 14 days after they had taken the decision not to look for a loan, the inter-Party Government reversed that decision.</P>
    <P>They decided they would look for a Marshall Aid loan.  As a result of that decision, these three promissory notes, under which we shall be paying interest and repaying principal to the 31st December, 1983, were signed by Mr. McGilligan.  These are the plain facts.</P>
    <P>Now, let us see what happened about the Marshall Aid.  I have already told you how that money was spent.  All the Marshall Aid dollars were spent in fact virtually before the end of 1949. There was built up, it is true, what was described as a Loan Counterpart Fund against the Marshall Aid dollars. That fund was built up in this way. If a person wanted to import dollar goods into this country he had to make arrangements with his bank whereby the bank bought dollars from the sterling pool and his sterling account, in <Col N="1000" /> turn, was debited with the appropriate amount in sterling for the dollars which he had secured.  Then, after a period, when the transaction had been vetted by the E.C.A. in the United States of America and the necessary documents cleared, the dollars were advanced and passed into the possession of the Irish Minister for Finance, my predecessor, Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot here to-day, as we have heard on other occasions, about the non-viability, so to speak, of sterling currency.  We have been told that sterling assets are not 22 carat gold, that sterling securities are likely to depreciate, that sterling is no longer a hard currency, that it is a soft currency, and, generally, that we should endeavour to dispossess ourselves of all the sterling securities which we have.  That, of course, is the policy of the Coalition Party when it is in Opposition but, when it was in Government what happened these Marshall Aid dollars which we got under the terms of these promissory notes?  The gentlemen who are now condemning us because we are not squandering sterling assets with the same rapidity as they endeavoured to do, went off and sold these dollars to the Bank of England for sterling.  They then took that sterling and deposited it here in the Central Bank, in the general account of the Minister for Finance and, with the full cognisance of the Minister for Finance of the day, that sterling was used to buy short-term sterling securities which remained in the Central Bank until they were realised and the proceeds transferred either to the Loan Counterpart Fund or to the Grant Counterpart Fund, as the case might be, depending upon the manner in which the dollars had originated. When they were there in the Loan Counterpart Fund and when my predecessor, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, wished to draw on them for the ordinary purposes of balancing his Budget&mdash;of meeting the deficit which there was in the Budget for 1949-50&mdash;he proceeded to draw out of his own account and the Central Bank had to realise some of these short-dated securities.  The position <Col N="1001" /> when we took office in the middle of June, 1951 was that there had already disappeared out of the Loan Counterpart Fund over £18,000,000 worth&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The point is this.  Every penny of that £24,000,000 had already been hypothecated by the commitments which our predecessors entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. These obligations, these debts, these commitments which we inherited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there were.  These commitments, these obligations, these contracts which we inherited were of such magnitude that, before six months were out, the whole of the £24,000,000 had to be expended in meeting the obligations of our predecessors.  Here is how they were met.  There was a <Col N="1002" /> cash deficit on the 1951 Budget on the 31st December of at least £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was spent on voted capital services £6.3 million. There was advanced to the E.S.B., to enable them to carry out plans that had been projected and that were actually in course of implementation when we took office, £6.4 million. There was advanced to the Local Loans Fund £6.3 million.  There was advanced to Bord na Móna £.86 million. Telephone capital required £1.6 million. £.24 million had to be found under the Transport Act.  In all, that came to over £26.7 million.  Those three items&mdash;the deficit on the current Budget, voted capital services and below-the-line issues, amounted to over £26.7 million, thus absorbing much more than the £24,000,000 which you left behind you.  Every penny of that, the Government found itself committed to when it put you out of office.  We had to take over and try and get the country out of the mess in which you left it.</P>
