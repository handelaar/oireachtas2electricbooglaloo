      <P>I brought to the notice of An Bord Fáilte for consideration on its merits, from the point of view of tourist traffic development, the suggestion that local enterprise should be encouraged and assisted in initiating a passenger boat service on the Shannon. I did not ask for a report from the board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the increasing number of Irish registered ships and in view of Ireland's geographical position he will consider requesting Irish Shipping, Limited, to examine the possibility of acquiring and operating one or more modern ocean-going salvage tugs to be operated by Irish Shipping, Limited, on a commercial basis, for salvage work and which would, in addition, be available in case of emergency to provide relief service to islands off our western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of ocean-going salvage tugs is a highly specialised business which, I understand, is not normally undertaken by shipping companies engaged in the carrying trade.  Furthermore, Irish Shipping, Limited, are already fully committed to an extensive building <Col N="1540" /> programme, which includes an oil tanker as well as a number of cargo vessels, and it would not be opportune at present to ask them to undertake the examination suggested.</P>
      <P>I would, however, welcome proposals from private interests for the development on a commercial basis of an Irish-owned salvage business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that, in view of the fact that this disaster occurred in a cross-Channel steamer which is owned by one of the companies that operate services in this part of the country, we have an interest in acertaining the causes of this disaster?  Furthermore, does the Minister not consider that the question of making adequate provision for quick rescue work in the event of a similar disaster occurring in the Irish Sea is a matter that also concerns the Government?  Would the Minister reconsider the whole position also on the basis that it would afford him and his Government an opportunity of expressing their sympathy with the people of the Six Counties who suffered in this disaster?</P>

      <P>On the 12th November, 1948, the then Government decided that the proposals for the reconstruction of Dublin Castle to provide accommodation for Government offices should not be proceeded with pending the giving of further instructions by the Government.  The Commissioners of Public Works were consulted at the time as to the structural condition of the buildings which were proposed to be demolished.  They reported that none of the buildings could really be described as sound, that they were unsuitable as permanent premises for Government Departments and that maintenance was increasingly wasteful.

    <P>In the case of practically all of these houses the local authorities concerned, when deciding to use the direct labour method, had not before them specific tenders from contractors and specific estimates from their own direct labour organisations.  While it had to be established in advance that the work could be carried out economically and expeditiously by direct labour, the circumstances in which the schemes originated do not make it possible to calculate the saving, if any, per house effected by utilising the direct labour system.</P>

This Bill is being introduced to amend and extend the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 1929 to 1949.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the substance in English.  I am not going to speak any more Irish.  The objects of the Bill are: To remove the prohibition under sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, on the making of a building grant or improving grant in respect of a dwelling-house for which a grant out of public moneys has been made at any time within seven years before the 20th December, 1929; to make provision for grants in respect of the installation of a private water supply and sewerage facilities in dwelling-houses; to make provision for grants in respect of extensions to dwelling-houses for the accommodation of visitors to the Gaeltacht; to remove the limit on the aggregate amount of grants and loans which may be sanctioned under the Acts; and to increase the amount of improving grants in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, no building grant or improving grant may be made in respect of a dwelling-house for which a grant out of public moneys has been made at any time within seven years before the passing of that Act, that is, seven years before the 20th December, 1929.  This restriction refers only to seven particular years and to no other years and the necessity for it is no longer apparent. One hundred and eighteen applications have been rejected since the 1st April, 1949, under this sub-section. I propose to remove this restriction <Col N="1572" /> now under Section 2 of the Bill, but in its place, I am making provision that no improving grant may be made in respect of a dwelling-house during the period of seven years following the making of a building grant or an improving grant in respect of the same dwelling-house.  This is being done by inserting a new sub-section (1a) in Section 7 of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that provision was made under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, that is the General Housing Act, for the making of grants in respect of the installation of a private water supply and sewerage facilities in dwelling-houses in areas where no public piped water supply or sewerage scheme is available.  Under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of this Bill, I propose to make provision for grants of this kind under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.  The amount of the maximum grant which will be available will be £50.  Provision will be made in the regulations that the amount of any grant shall not exceed three-fourths of the estimated cost.  No loan will be available in respect of this work and the grant will not be given except in respect of an installation commenced after the 29th April, 1952.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the date is the operative date in the Housing Act of 1952.  The grant will be a relevant grant for the purposes of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952.  It may be necessary to define the words &ldquo;relevant grant&rdquo;&mdash;that is a grant under the 1952 General Housing Act which a local authority is enabled under that Act to supplement by way of a grant from its own resources.  I might mention also at this stage that similar provision, that is a supplemental grant by a local authority for the erection of a new house, has been made in respect of houses in the Gaeltacht areas under the Gaeltacht Acts by the Housing (1952) Act itself.  Therefore, it is not necessary to make that provision in this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>The Acts provide already that the normal building grant may be increased by £50 in any case where a piped water supply and sewerage facilities are <Col N="1573" /> installed when a house is being built. Under the same sub-section (1) I propose to make provision for grants in respect of additional accommodation for visitors to the Gaeltacht.  The provision is intended to cater for those who visit the Gaeltacht for the purpose of improving their knowledge of the Irish language, but it is not thought practicable specifically to restrict the provision to that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that more people would visit the Gaeltacht if suitable accommodation were available for them, and that the people of the Gaeltacht would provide such accommodation if financial assistance were available.  I might add here that during some of my visits to the Gaeltacht areas I found that there were complaints, particularly from organisations which sponsor courses for young students seeking to learn the Irish language, to the effect that there was not sufficient accommodation available in the immediate vicinity for these young students.</P>
    <P>It was in order to overcome that lack of accommodation that this specific provision is being made.  I think everybody will agree that the best way to provide young people with a knowledge of Irish is to provide accommodation for them in the homes of Gaelic-speaking families, within the Gaeltacht areas.  This provision is designed to facilitate the creation of new accommodation and, therefore, to facilitate more and more young students being accommodated so as to learn Irish in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>In order that the additional accommodation may confirm to present-day requirements, these grants will be subject to the condition that an adequate water supply and sewerage facilities must be installed, if not already available in the dwelling-house being extended.  The maximum grant which will be made in respect of a special extension for the accommodation of visitors will be £80, but a loan up to £40 will be available in addition on certain conditions.  Provision will be made under the regulations that the amount of any grant shall not exceed three-quarters of the estimated cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> Under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, a limit of £250,000 was placed on the aggregate amount of grants and loans to be made under the Act.  It was found necessary from time to time to extend that limit, and accordingly provision for larger aggregate amounts was made in amending Acts passed in 1931, 1934, 1939 and 1949.  In the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1949, the aggregate amount was fixed at £900,000 and that limit has now almost been reached.  Under Section 4 of the Bill, I propose to repeal Section 2 of the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1949, so as to obviate the need for further legislation solely to provide for funds, and to bring the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts into line in this respect with the General Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>Under Section 19 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, the maximum reconstruction grant of £80 authorised under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, was increased to grants of £80, £100 and £120 according to certain conditions.  Under Section 5 of this Bill, I propose to increase improving grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts in the same manner.  An improving grant not exceeding £80 will be available in respect of a house containing, on completion of the work, three rooms, an improving grant not exceeding £100 in the case of a house containing four rooms and an improving grant not exceeding £120 in the case of a house containing five rooms.</P>
    <P>The existing regulations provide that the amount of any improving grant may not exceed three-fourths of the estimated cost.  These new grants will have effect in respect of applications sanctioned since 29th April, 1952, and in which the work had not begun before that date.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill will operate to improve housing conditions in the Gaeltacht, and I commend it accordingly to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We take it that this Bill is designed to enlarge, improve and make more reasonable certain facilities which previous Gaeltacht Housing Acts were designed to make available and that this Bill, in the <Col N="1575" /> main, amends the legislation in so far as certain hardships have arisen in the working of the last Act.  We welcome the fact that this Bill also resolves what difficulties may have arisen under the Local Government Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill can be commended to the House.  If we are in earnest in dealing with the problem of the Gaeltacht, particularly in relation to the survival of the language, we must endeavour to make grants for various types of improvements in Gaeltacht dwellings more readily available.  I welcome the alteration that will encourage people to provide a more adequate type of accommodation for people who may wish to spend some time in the Gaeltacht in pursuit of a better knowledge of their own language.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, we welcome the provisions of this Bill.  For a long time we have realised the necessity for it. The Parliamentary Secretary can have our commendation in respect of the expedition with which the Bill has seen the light of the Dáil.  It would not serve any practical purpose to delay by discussion here the passage of the Bill. We feel that the Bill will bring about certain amendments in respect of which the House is unanimous.  Wordy beating against the air would not be justified in connection with a Bill of this nature which affects vitally people in áiteanna iargúlta and which brings into the Gaeltacht areas a little money to enable people to carry out necessary work, such as water supply, or other improvements, whether in the West of Ireland or the South or SouthWest of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wish God-speed to the effort and hope that this Bill is sufficiently comprehensive to cover the working errors discovered in the general housing plans for the Gaeltacht.  We hope that the Bill will prove of immense value to the people in the Gaeltacht districts.  I trust that applications for grants, payments of grants and the general operation of the disbursement of money under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts will not get into the appalling mess, tangle, debacle and impassable and insoluble red tape difficulties that can arise in local government in connection with <Col N="1576" /> normal housing.  If this Bill is to be of any appreciable benefit to the people of the Gaeltacht it must be worked efficiently and quickly and there must be a reasonably humanitarian approach to the problems that arise when grants are applied for.  Above all, I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that, while he will have the unanimous blessing of the House for this measure, he should ensure that no administrative difficulties will clog schemes that he conceives for the improvement of the general standard of life in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I find fault with this Bill, not for what is in it, but for what is not in it.  As far as I am concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary will get all the assistance he can to get the Bill through the House as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>I should have liked the Parliamentary Secretary to bring in a Bill repealing all the previous Acts and embodying the amendments or improvements provided in this Bill. That would be codifying the Gaeltacht Housing Acts in one Bill.  Even at this stage I do not think it would delay the Bill if the Parliamentary Secretary were to accept that suggestion.  I would have no objection if the Parliamentary Secretary were to withdraw the present Bill and bring in one Bill embodying all the provisions of the 1929 and the 1949 Acts that still stand and the proposals and amendments in this Bill, for the sake of keeping the legislation tidy, so to speak.  I have a very nasty remembrance of the condition into which the Land Acts have drifted.  I would not like to see Gaeltacht Housing Acts developing in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the last Gaeltacht Housing (Amendment) Bill that the House will be asked to pass.  From time to time there will be further improvements.  Times and conditions will change, making further amending Bills necessary.  I make that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary. I am sure that the scrapping of the previous Acts and the drafting of an entirely new Bill would not take any <Col N="1577" /> more than a week, because there are only two Acts&mdash;the 1929 and the 1949 Acts&mdash;and whatever improvements are proposed in the present Bill.  That would not delay the whole business more than a week.  I am sure the draftsman would be able to handle the job in a week.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary has decided to give some benefits in the matter of water and sanitation to the people of the Gaeltacht area.  There is one thing, however, that I am not clear about. Does the Parliamentary Secretary propose in the Bill to give grants for water and sanitation for existing houses?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a step in the right direction.  I also welcome the proposal to give improvement, or reconstruction grants as they are called in the local government housing code, for the purpose of extensions for visitors.  Improvement grants for any purposes are very necessary and very good.  I am glad that Section 2 of the 1949 Act is being repealed.  I could never understand why that limitation was necessary.  I suppose some of the officials of the Department of Finance might be able to explain it.  I do not believe it served any useful purpose.</P>
      <P>Under Section 5 of the Bill, will the Parliamentary Secretary let us know what volume of improvements will be necessary to qualify for a grant?  In previous Acts I think the wording was &ldquo;substantial structural alteration.&rdquo; That is not the case in Local Government Housing Acts under which grants can be made for the reconstruction or improvement of existing houses which does not involve substantial structural alteration.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that in the Gaeltacht areas such improvement grants are even more necessary and beneficial and desirable from every point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last matter I want to refer to has been raised very often in this House.  It is one about which I feel very strongly and that is Section 11, <Col N="1578" /> sub-section (3) of the 1929 Act which makes it absolutely imperative that the Minister must be satisfied before making a grant that Irish is the spoken language of the home.  It might happen that either the man or the wife would be a fluent Irish speaker but that one of them came from an area where Irish was not the spoken language.  In a case like that it is not fair to deny a grant to an applicant.  Where either the man or his wife can speak the language fluently I think a grant should be made available.</P>
    <P>It might happen that a man living in an Irish-speaking district might marry a girl from outside the district or that a girl in an Irish-speaking district might marry a man from an outside district.  As there is nothing about it in the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary should bring in an amendment on the Committee Stage modifying that section, as I do not think it is fair to refuse a grant where one or the other can speak the language fluently.  I think the wording of the particular section in the 1929 Act is that Irish must be the spoken language of the home.</P>
    <P>During the period of the inter-Party Government, it was brought to my notice that something like 22 applicants from the Clifden area in Galway were turned down because the inspector who visited the applicants felt satisfied that Irish was not the spoken language of the home.  To turn down 22 applicants in a district in Galway under a Gaeltacht Housing Act is a farce.  There is a considerable amount of Irish spoken there.  Irish is spoken at fairs and markets, in the homes, in schools and in churches more than the English language.  I, therefore, impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity of bringing in an amendment to modify that section of the 1929 Act.  Where one party in a house has a fluent knowledge of the language, it is grossly unfair to deny an applicant the benefit of a house.  It is carrying the letter of the Act much beyond the spirit aimed at in the 1929 Act.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in conclusion, to consider withdrawing this Bill and codifying the existing Acts and this Bill in one Bill so as to keep <Col N="1579" /> the legislation in connection with Gaeltacht housing in proper order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The doubt I have about this Bill is that, while it purports to do a highly necessary thing, the financial provisions of it will not, in fact, be any inducement to the people whom it is supposed to benefit. Section 3 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister is satisfied that the condition of a dwelling-house in the Gaeltacht is such as justifies the provision and installation therein of a private water supply and sewerage facilities . . .&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that not only the water supply but the sanitary accommodation must be provided inside the house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first case, the water has to be found somewhere. This is making provision for cases where no public water supply is available. Most of us know enough about rural Ireland to realise that, while in some cases one can get a water supply within ten, 15 or 20 yards of a house, in the majority of cases there is no stream or river near the house at all and the people live in small colonies away from a river or stream.  Now what sort of water supply can be provided for an expenditure of £50?  The Parliamentary Secretary knows what prices are to-day.  He must know how far £50 would go to-day in providing a water supply.  A quarter of a mile of piping may have to be laid.  The bringing of the water to the house is the first essential.  After that one is faced with the cost of plumbing and the installation of a closet and so on in order to complete the job inside.  Will it be mandatory under this to install a bathroom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It says water and sewerage facilities.  That does not mean that there must be a shower-bath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the areas involved under this Bill pretty well <Col N="1580" /> and in most of them water would have to be piped for possibly a mile.  It is no use beginning a job unless that job can be completed.  This is the operative section of this Bill and I think the House will agree that the Parliamentary Secretary will have to reconsider the question of costing.  He can get the advice of his officials who have been around the country on that.  I think £50 is utterly useless for the purpose envisaged.  I am not to be taken as suggesting that the taxpayer's money should be lashed around but if we intend to do a job in a practical way we must be realistic about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary must agree that water and sewerage could not be supplied at a cost of £50.</P>
      <P>The people whom we intend to benefit by this measure have no money at all in the majority of cases except what they earn in England and Scotland. That is not the gold mine that it was three or four years ago.  The workers now get no overtime.  They have to pay income-tax on their earnings and they have to pay for their lodgings. The married men are running a home in Ireland and paying for themselves in England or Scotland.  There is very little left out of what they earn.  The expenditure of £50 on the provision of water and sewerage would be useless.</P>
      <P>In many of the inland areas provision has been made under the Local Government Act passed last year to supply water and sewerage.  In the inland areas a water supply is as a rule much more convenient to houses than it is in the Gaeltacht areas.  In a wet season there is plenty of water everywhere. In the Gaeltacht water is not so abundant.  A ram might be required to drive the water a certain distance. That would never be an economic proposition and it certainly could not be done for £50.  It would take all of that sum to bring the water to the house first of all without ever bringing it inside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act passed last year covered supplementary grants for the rural areas.  In sub-section (3) of Section 4 of this measure I want to know what is the meaning of the special extension grants.  Is that meant to make available a grant to a house already built <Col N="1581" /> under the Gaeltacht Act and in which a grant has already been given? Hitherto a second grant could not be given.  Is this intended to cover that? Is it to cover the cost of building a further extension by way of a little return-room to hold a bathroom and a lavatory?</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 5 is urgently required.  That provision should have been made last year contemporaneously with the Local Government Act.  As it is, the people in the Gaeltacht areas feel that they were handicapped and unfairly treated in comparison with the people in the inland areas.  I am glad that provision is now being made in this Bill.  I welcome the Bill and appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the amount of the grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy McMenamin in welcoming this Bill, and if I have any criticism to offer it is not on this particular Bill; it is on the legislation introduced affecting housing in the Gaeltacht generally.  We Deputies from the Gaeltacht appreciate better than the Parliamentary Secretary or those who administer these measures the difficulties affecting the Gaeltacht.  Most residents in the Gaeltacht are poor and no legislation introduced here has so far catered for the &ldquo;too poor&rdquo;.  An Irish speaker living in the Gaeltacht who wishes to take advantage of any of these Gaeltacht housing schemes must have a certain amount of capital.  Some provision should be made whereby the supply of the raw materials necessary will be guaranteed in order that the wholesale merchant or the shopkeeper need not fear that he will be at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Donegal the suppliers have been most generous but I understand that in parts of the West of Ireland considerable difficulty has been experienced. The applicants have difficulty in finding purveyors or suppliers who will provide them with the materials for the necessary building. That is a matter which calls for the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Another fault I have to find with this legislation is that under these Acts houses may only be built to replace existing houses.  That is <Col N="1582" /> unfortunate.  We are anxious to retain the people in the Gaeltacht.  We are anxious to permit young Irish speakers to remain in the Gaeltacht and build their own houses there.  We know of cases where young married men who possibly bought small farms in which there have been no dwellings and who procured sites, are debarred from taking advantage of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  I think they should be put on a level with their brothers who have hovels and who wish to have those hovels knocked down and proper houses built.  The fact that one member of the family succeeds to the old homestead, whereas his brother gets only, say, a building site should not debar the latter from procuring the advantages which are definitely to be procured under these Acts.  I would make a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am certain that Deputies from all parts of the Gaeltacht will support me, to bring in on the Committee Stage a section amending this Bill to permit those unfortunates to whom I have referred to take advantage not only of this Bill but of the previous legislation introduced to improve housing in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker my remarks on the Bill will be short and necessarily complimentary. I would like at the outset to emphasise the point he has made with regard to the replacement of houses in the Gaeltacht. It is essential at the moment in order to qualify for a building grant in the Gaeltacht to show that you are replacing an existing house which is not considered up to the standard required for habitation.  That might have been justified in the past when it could be pointed out that the first objective was to replace older houses but I think the time has arrived when we should be prepared to facilitate the sons of those people who may return.  We have occasionally retiring civil servants, retiring schoolteachers and retiring Gardaí who are anxious to come and live in the Gaeltacht.  These people find themselves debarred from qualifying for a grant to build in the Gaeltacht if they desired to end their <Col N="1583" /> days there.  That is an omission which I hope will be remedied at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>They cannot be deprived of the ordinary housing grant but they are deprived of the Gaeltacht grant which shows a differential to the Gaeltacht dweller. In some cases where exceptional circumstances could be shown they have been able to secure the grant but not without great difficulty.</P>
      <P>One section I welcome in the Bill is the one that enables people in the Gaeltacht to provide for the keeping of visitors by extensions to their houses.  This is particularly necessary in the Gaeltacht areas where people are accustomed to keep during the summer the pupils of the Irish colleges. That particular section which enables them to extend their houses or make the necessary provision for keeping visitors is particularly welcome. I think that any extra moneys placed at the disposal of the people of the Gaeltacht for housing are very welcome.</P>
      <P>I doubt if at any time we have gone sufficiently far to meet the requirements of these people.  One might think that the grant now available for housing either for the erection of new houses or for the reconstruction of an existing one is particularly generous.  It is in a sense but when one considers the number of labourers' cottages being built throughout the entire country, which bring people in from the countryside to live in villages and towns, and the fact that the full cost of those houses is being subsidised by the ratepayers, the portion of the cost, £300 or whatever the reconstruction grant is for Gaeltacht housing is by no means too generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of this measure and to assure him we acknowledge the efforts he is making towards ameliorating the lot of those people.  In saying that, however, we trust he will not fail to examine further the position with regard to housing and if possible in the near future to remove some of the obstacles that still stand in the way of better housing in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary concludes, I would like to comment on the suggestion made by Deputy Blowick that the qualification of being Irish speakers be not insisted upon in the administration of the Act.  If Deputy Blowick examines this suggestion of his I do not think he would persist in recommending it. The Gaeltacht areas, as defined in the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, go up to the Shannon and the one limitation is that the applicant have some knowledge of the Irish language.  If you accept Deputy Blowick's suggestion and remove this Irish qualification you will have a very anomalous position arising, say, along the banks of the Shannon.  You would have quite well-to-do landholders on the west side of the Shannon qualifying for these grants whereas ordinary small working farmers on the east side of the Shannon would be denied them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think he is correct in saying that 22 people in the Clifden district who qualified for these grants were denied them.  He stated that Irish was spoken to a lesser or greater extent in these households.  My experience of the field officers administering these Acts is that they stretch to the utmost limit in favour of the applicant in the interpretation of this particular qualification about knowledge of Irish.  Very often, in fact, one could say that if there was a re-examination of a decision possibly it would be reversed. If that suggestion of Deputy Blowick's were to be accepted there would not be any justification for retaining the word &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; in the title of the Housing Act.  It would then just be a special type of housing facilities made <Col N="1585" /> available to districts that are economically poor.  There may be a case for that but I do not think we have the right to throw out our chest and say we are doing something in the housing direction in favour of the Gaeltacht as a linguistic conception in any event.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties&mdash;Deputy O'Donnell referred to some of them&mdash; which are fairly acute in the West. There is the question, for instance, of the supply of materials.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that in the administration of the general Housing Acts it is possible for the applicant to sign a document authorising the Department to issue the paying order, when it has become payable, to the supplier of the materials. I take it that it is possible to do the same thing in relation to the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  I do not know whether in fact it is being done but, if not, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it might help us to some extent on the question of procuring supplies&mdash;I do not think it would meet the problem entirely.  If the big advantage of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts is to be retained&mdash;that is the procuring of the supplies of materials for the applicant by the Gaeltacht Services section&mdash;I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to ask the Gaeltacht Services section to try to find a solution for the position arising where the contractor backs out or where one is not available.  The commodity of course that causes the greatest difficulty is timber.  It ought to be possible to find a solution for this difficulty by enlisting the good offices of that other section of the Department of Lands, namely, the Forestry Department in finding a solution to that problem.  I know the Gaeltacht Services are aware of this particular difficulty in the West of Ireland and that they have attempted to find a solution for it.  I refer to it now because of the fact that it is one of the causes of holding up building in western areas.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Brennan's suggestion in regard to giving these Gaeltacht grants to everybody who decides to return to the Gaeltacht. <Col N="1586" /> As I understand the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, they were designed originally&mdash;and I believe this conception of them still obtains&mdash;to benefit people who live by agriculture to the greatest possible extent.  In other words, the Acts have been interpreted as applying to people who have Land Commission Receivable Orders.  There are other categories of people whose services are necessary to the community there who also qualify&mdash;a teacher, a public health nurse, a postman or a person of that kind but generally speaking these houses are made available for the benefit of our people engaged in agriculture.  I think it would be most unfair if a person who spent his life out of the Gaeltacht and who decided to come back after his retirement from some public office, should qualify for one of these grants. I do not know that a very good case can be made for that.  If such people were to qualify for these grants, it would absorb a good deal of the time, the attention, and the money which is being made available by these Acts for people who derived a considerable part of their livelihood from the pursuit of agriculture.</P>

      <P>This procedure of putting up one Parliamentary Secretary to provide a Gaelic muzzle for the dog and another Parliamentary Secretary to provide a Gaelic tail for the dog, while both of them furnish the forequarters and the hindquarters in English, is a feat I have not witnessed in the House before in my quarter of a century's experience.  I have yet to learn that in sharing the joint responsibility of the Government, it is customary for two Parliamentary Secretaries to engage in this exhibition of jousting in regard to their respective responsibilities.  I understand that Deputy Bartley and Deputy Lynch are both Parliamentary Secretaries and they both share responsibility for Government policy.  Why, therefore, Deputy Bartley should exhort Deputy Lynch to do what he at least should have known he is already doing, I do not know.  I understand that Deputy Lynch is Parliamentary Secretary for the coordination of the various Ministeries and I would regard it as an indelicacy for any Deputy over here to imply that Deputy Lynch had fallen down on the job of co-ordinating the work of the various Departments concerned with this Bill.  I am quite ready to believe that he has been successful in achieving that so far as it can be done, and it is difficult to understand why another Parliamentary Secretary should intervene to query this for the edification of his constituents in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reinforce some of the observations made by Deputy Blowick. One suggestion I would commend to him is that we should not seek to amend Bills by the method followed here because it becomes more difficult to understand what they are about.  I do not know what this Bill means when it says that we want to amend Section 7 of the Act of 1929 by the deletion of certain words and the insertion of <Col N="1588" /> certain other words.  Of course I could find out by collating all the previous statutes in the library with this Bill but if you want to amend a relatively simple measure, it would be just as well to start by repealing the previous Act, re-enacting what you want to retain and leaving out anything you want left out.  I am not making that as a special point against the Parliamentary Secretary. I appreciate that that point has been made against many Ministers.  I merely suggested that where he is asked to deal with legislation of this kind, he should bear in mind the desirability of avoiding this procedure of legislating by reference.</P>
    <P>The second point made by Deputy Blowick is one on which I feel strongly and I am amazed that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture should have thought it right or expedient to intervene in this discussion for the purpose of throwing his influence in the scale against the reform advocated by Deputy Blowick. I do not know how far Deputy Bartley is right in saying that the fíor-Ghaeltacht, as defined by the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, extends to the Shannon.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I would be quite prepared to say that the benefits of the Gaeltacht Housing Act should be confined to the fíor-Ghaeltacht and the breac-Ghaeltacht.  I do not see why they should not.  I think the ordinary grants are the appropriate grants for those parts of the country which lie outside the fíor-Ghaeltacht and the breac-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be prepared to support Deputy Blowick's representations energetically in so far as they apply to the fíor-Ghaeltacht.  It is a wholly deplorable situation in which you find that, in a village of five or six houses, three houses have been rebuilt with the aid of Gaeltacht housing grants while two other houses, which are quite as <Col N="1589" /> much in need of reconstruction or replacement, continue in a deplorable condition of disrepair because, it appears, a man has married &ldquo;clann isteach&rdquo;.  The old people and the daughter of the house have been speaking Irish all their lives but, just because a man from an area may be five or six miles away married into the house&mdash;an area where Irish has ceased to be the vernacular&mdash;the house into which he has married is not eligible for a grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am directing the Parliamentary Secretary's attention not to the difficulties: he has the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture to do that for him: he has the officers of the Depart- of Finance to do that for him and he has the officers of his own Division to do that for him.  He has everybody in the Government to explain to him what he cannot do for the people in the Gaeltacht: I am pointing out to him the things he ought to do now and I am trying to devise suggestions as to how they can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well remember the time when the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Agriculture.  Deputy Bartley, would, when he was on this side of the House, rend passion to tatters if I had produced the grotesque objections that he now produces against providing for the fíor-Ghaeltacht a measure of equity which he would have us deny them lest it be extended to the residents of East Galway.  Surely there is legislative machinery available to this House to ensure that if we want to extend a measure of equity to the residents of the fíor-Ghaeltacht we shall be able to do it without taking in the residents of Rathmines, Monte-notte, <Col N="1590" /> Athlone or Loughrea.  Interesting enough, I think Loughrea, for the purposes of a medical officer, is part of the fíor or breac-Ghaeltacht.  I never heard of a word of Irish being spoken there for the past half century but you cannot be appointed medical officer of health for that particular area if you do not speak Irish.  I do not believe there is any validity in such a Gaeltacht as that.  It is perfectly manifest that the areas defined subsequent to the old Gaeltacht Inquiry of, I think, 1926, urgently required re-definition because to leave them in their present form provides fuel to people like Deputy Bartley for advocating that you do nothing for the fíor-Ghaeltacht on the ground that the greater part of the Gaeltacht is not the Gaeltacht at all. Let us find out what parts of the country we are all agreed upon can properly be described as &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; and then really go and try to do something to help the people there.</P>
    <P>The Government of which I was a member determined that you could safely say that Connemara was within the fíor-Ghaeltacht.  We knew, as well as Deputy Bartley knew, that everybody in the town of Clifden did not speak Irish but we did not exclude the town of Clifden.  We took the whole area and said: &ldquo;If you want to do anything effective you must get an area which you are prepared to treat as an area and not say that there is no Irish in this house but Irish is spoken in those four houses over there.&rdquo;  Then we appointed an administrator for Connemara and said that, on the basis that Connemara is fíor-Ghaeltacht, we are prepared to justify to Dáil Éireann degrees of assistance for its preservation. We frankly confess that we could not dream of recommending such action to Dáil Éireann if we had to say that the area we had in mind was fíor-Ghaeltacht in the literal sense of the word.  No Deputy in this House, that I know of, desires to see the maintenance of discrimination between one resident and another in the fíor-Ghaeltacht. Our object is to remedy the notoriously bad housing which we set our hand to eliminate 30 years ago&mdash; and at which we have made such good progress in eliminating-and have its <Col N="1591" /> place taken by decent houses for the people living in the poorer parts of the country.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary, with regard to the form adumbrated by Deputy Blowick, provide that in the fíor-Ghaeltacht there will be no discrimination because one member of the family is not as fluent at the Irish language as another.  I do not believe the costs would be even significant but I believe that the social advantage would be very great.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Bartley is aware of it but I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government is aware that we in the Department of Agriculture long since abandoned the archaic definition of the Gaeltacht as contained in the Gaeltacht Commission Report and, with the assistance of our own parish agents in the congested areas, we defined the Gaeltacht area as the townlands in which we were satisfied Irish was substantially the vernacular of the people.  To those areas we extended the special scheme for poultry and the special scheme for subsidised seeds in respect of the grain and potato crops.  To those areas we extended a variety of special services which it was within the discretion of the general powers of the Minister for Agriculture to provide as he thought it necessary.  We did not say: &ldquo;If we provide these schemes in the fíor-Ghaeltacht we will find demands coming to us from the parish agent in Athenry to provide them there&rdquo;&mdash; because we said we intended these things for the fior-Ghaeltacht and did not intend them for Athenry.  We were not one bit deterred if he pointed out to us the line and letter of the law of the Gaeltacht Commission Report. Signs on it, does any Deputy of the fíor-Ghaeltacht question the fact that the poultry scheme worked well and that the benefit went where we intended it to go&mdash;to the fíor-Ghaeltacht?</P>
    <P>When we came to institute the Connemara scheme, will anyone deny that the special additional facilities which we provided under it for the fíor-Ghaeltacht went to the fíor-Ghaeltacht and did not go outside it?  There <Col N="1592" /> are a number of Deputies who will be obliged to testify that they applied to the Department of Agriculture to get the fíor-Ghaeltacht defined by us so that these special services might be extended to it.  I can say that where-ever they were able to convince us that the townland they wanted brought in was specifically Irish speaking, we were delighted to bring it in.  We had to be satisfied on that.  If we were able to controvert their view that the area or the townland was not specifically Irish speaking, then, no matter what the Gaeltacht Commission had said, we did not bring it in and we would not bring it in.</P>
    <P>All that I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do is this: If he has any difficulty about ascertaining what is, in fact, the true fíor-Ghaeltacht, &mdash;and when I say that I mean a townland or an area in which the Irish language is the spoken language in the homes of the people&mdash;all he has to do is to apply to the Department of Agriculture where he will be furnished with a map.  On that map every townland is marked to which that description may be aptly applied.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether or not in those areas at least this restrictive covenant in respect of Gaeltacht housing grants should not be removed so that all of us will be free to say to everyone who makes his home in one of these townlands: &ldquo;If you want a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, you are entitled to apply for it and you will get it if you are prepared to build a new house for yourself and your family&rdquo;.  Remember that unless we do that, what is going to happen is that the families which are settled there at the moment, and which I believe are a great treasure to the nation as well as to the area in which they live will move out and go elsewhere. It is not easy to persuade many of them to stay in the Gaeltacht. Where you have a clann isteach marrying into one of these houses in the Gaeltacht who finds that, because he came from outside it, he cannot get a grant to rebuild a manifestly inadequate house while he sees all his neighbours around him looking down <Col N="1593" /> on him because his house, in comparison with theirs is a broken-down hovel, he will have the strong temptation to sell out-to sell his bit of land among his neighbours and to move off in the direction of his own people.</P>
    <P>If that should happen, then you are going to have one family less in the Gaeltacht and one more in the Galltacht. I do not believe that there is any member of the House who wants to see a situation of that kind arise.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will put down an amendment for the Committee Stage on the lines I have suggested.  If he likes, he can schedule these particular townlands to the Bill, so that the qualification that I speak of will apply in future.  I think if he does that, he will get the almost unanimous support of the House with the exception, perhaps, of Deputy Bartley.  I suggest that the reform I am urging on the Parliamentary Secretary will get him support from this side.  If needs be, reluctant and all as I am ever to find myself in the same Lobby with a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, I will cheerfully follow the Parliamentary Secretary into the Lobby in support of his amendment, and both of us will have the opportunity of seeing Deputy Bartley hooking himself up in the other Lobby and opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which, I think, ought to be cleared up at the outset.  Some Deputies do not seem to be very clear in their minds about it.  A question that was asked by Deputy Hickey illustrates the necessity for making the point clear.  It is this: The fact that a person is living within the Gaeltacht area and does not qualify for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, does not preclude him from receiving a State grant for the purpose of building a house or reconstructing a house.  It is always open to any person who does not qualify under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts to apply for and to receive, subject to the usual qualifications, a new housing grant or a reconstruction grant from a local authority in respect of whatever type of work he wants to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is not true to say that a person who for one reason or <Col N="1594" /> another fails to qualify in the Gaeltacht area, finds himself without any redress or assistance in the matter of providing a new home for himself or in reconstructing a house or in increasing amenities within his house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of them as I understood it was to give extra facilities, by way of extra grants or extra reliefs in the remission of rates and otherwise to Gaelic-speaking households to construct new houses for themselves.  That was done in furtherance of the language rather than for any social purpose.  That is the purpose which the Gaeltacht Housing Acts had when passed and amended, as they have been from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that their purpose was to remove the conditions under which the people in the Gaeltacht were obliged to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Gaeltacht Housing Acts&mdash;that is over and above the ordinary housing legislation&mdash;have been designed to benefit those who live in homes where Irish is the spoken language.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell has pointed out that any resident in the Gaeltacht is as qualified as any other person to apply for and to receive a local government grant for the building or reconstruction of a house.  I admit that there is a special case for giving the residents in the Gaeltacht areas increased facilities in this respect, that is, even apart from the language problem. I think there are good historical reasons for doing so.  One is that their economic potential is not as good as that of people living outside the fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the other major question raised in the debate.  I think <Col N="1595" /> it was Deputy O'Donnell who referred to the question of providing grants only for what are known as replacement houses.  The same considerations apply there as in the other case with which I have been dealing.  If a person not already in possession of a house seeks to build a house or to improve one and applies to the local authority for a grant, then, unless he occupies some kind of habitation, he does not qualify to receive a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  I can say quite truthfully that that is a feature of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts which has caused me a good deal of concern ever since they became my special responsibility.  It is unfortunate that the person who, for one reason or another, possibly because he was a second son and did not have a house or some kind of habitation of his own within the scheduled areas, did not qualify to receive the special benefits of the Gaeltacht housing code.  On that matter, I canvassed the opinions of people who, I thought, had special knowledge of the situation&mdash;members of the present Government, people who are well used to living in the Gaeltacht and congested areas, members of the Land Commission staff who had experience in dealing with the special problem of relieving congestion.  As a result of the different advice which I received, I am not completely happy in my mind that this restriction that applies in the case of an applicant who is not in occupation of some sort of habitation should not be removed.  My mind is not completely made up one way or the other.  I know there is a point there but the Land Commission people say: &ldquo;Our problem is to relieve congestion. Congestion is apparent in these Gaeltacht areas to a greater extent than anywhere else.  To facilitate the building of new houses where there is not already in existence a house that requires replacement would only add to our problems and to the general congestion problems.&rdquo;</P>

I will add that I am entirely in sympathy with the point of view put forward by both Deputy O'Donnell and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of bringing in a comprehensive Bill, repealing the various existing Gaeltacht Housing Acts, again I am attracted to that suggestion but, unfortunately, there was one consideration which required expeditious introduction of this Bill&mdash;I referred to it in my opening statement&mdash;that was, that that money was running out.  Deputy Dillon recently gave a very good account of what would happen if some Minister or Parliamentary Secretary required the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Department of Finance to carry out expeditious examination of a Bill, knowing, as he pointed out on that occasion, that all the other Ministers and all the other Parliamentary Secretaries <Col N="1597" /> are at the throats, practically, of the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Department of Finance to expedite examination of their own particular Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will remind the Minister for Justice of that fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To use a Dillonese &mdash; I would be told to go and have a running jump at myself.  It was not without some pressure that I was in a position to introduce this Bill at this stage. Therefore, much as I am attracted to Deputy Blowick's suggestion, supported by Deputy Dillon, I am very happy that I am in a position at the moment to introduce this Bill and I do not think I would be justified in causing more delay by asking the Parliamentary Draftsman to draft a comprehensive Bill and asking the Department of Finance and all other Departments whose views I must canvass to look into the Bill.</P>
      <P>As to the suggestion of Deputy Blowick that the requirement of a substantial structural alteration should no longer be necessary, the Deputy knows that that requirement is in the regulations under different Acts.  It is to avoid patchwork rather than substantial structural work that the particular requirement is there.  At the present time I do not think there is any real case made for altering that requirement and, unless a substantial structural alteration can be shown, I do not think an applicant should qualify for a reconstruction grant.</P>

      <P>I will look into it in the meantime.  Deputy McMenamin made a special point about the installation of water and sewerage facilities and made a great deal of play about the fact that £50 would be far too low a provision for the installation of a bath and whatever water and sewerage facilities might be necessary.  I told the Deputy in answer to a question he put to me in the course of his remarks that the installation of a bath was not necessary in order to qualify but I should like to point out to him that the Bill specifically provides for a local authority, if they are satisfied, to make a grant of a similar amount to a person who is anxious to bring water and sewerage facilities to his house, with the result that he could under this section qualify for a grant in all of £100 instead of £50.  I am informed that the fairly generous estimate of what the ordinary water and sewerage facilities would cost in such case is about £120.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no.  With regard to the supply of materials in the West of Ireland, I am aware that there was a particular difficulty in getting builders providers to supply building materials under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts in the West of Ireland in recent months. That was caused by various factors. One probably was that the existing man was not able to get his money either quickly enough or possibly at all in some cases.  It is generally known that there has been a rate of building in Galway City in recent years of such <Col N="1599" /> a magnitude as could not be expected to be continued.  It required all the resources, possibly, of builders providers in the area to supply the necessary material.  That, as everybody knows, is falling off.  There have been advertisements for tenders for supply of these materials and it is hoped that in the near future the situation will have eased and that a contractor well able to fulfil the needs of this particular area will be forthcoming.  I hope that will be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Contractors, yes.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Dillon as to what the Gaeltacht area is and who, within that area, are entitled to grants, I agree entirely that, from the administrative point of view, it would be far better if we knew exactly what area Gaeltacht Acts could be made apply to, but the area to which these Acts apply is scheduled under the 1929 Act and, peculiarly enough, it is so wide that, in addition to embracing the Counties of Kerry, Galway, Donegal, parts of Cork and Clare, the schedule covers parts of the County Cavan, even parts of County Louth and County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the face of the Gaeltacht area is changing from time to time and that it is very hard to decide what is and what is not the pure Gaeltacht.  Possibly it is time that this schedule should be examined and overhauled.  If presented with another opportunity, I hope I can undertake that particular aspect of it.  In the meantime, I do not intend to change the present system of deciding as to who and who is not qualified for a Gaeltacht housing grant.  The definition is contained in Section 4 of the 1934 Act and once a person who seeks a grant is the occupier of a house within the scheduled area, and Irish is the language habitually spoken in the house, he is qualified for a grant.  Having <Col N="1600" /> regard to all the circumstances, I do not think it would be proper at this stage to introduce an amendment to that particular qualification.  There were no other points raised by Deputies so far as I remember, but if there are any points that require attention, perhaps they can be dealt with in further detail on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not think there would be any difficulty in regard to that.  As to Deputy Blowick's point in regard to the present schedule defining the area, if there was a relaxation of the necessary qualification with regard to the speaking of the language, it would be quite obvious that far too many would qualify for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.</P>

I do not ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reply now but to look into it.</P>

    <Title>National Stud Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the National Stud Act, 1945, a company named Colucht Groighe Náisiúnta na hÉireann, Teoranta (the Irish National Stud Company, Limited), was set up by the Minister for Agriculture in April, 1946, to carry on, in the interests of the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry, the business of stud farming at the National Stud Farm, Tully, Kildare, or on any other land held by the company. An annual licence to use and occupy <Col N="1602" /> the National Stud Farm for this purpose has been granted to the company by the Minister each year since 1946.</P>
      <P>Under Section 11 of the 1945 Act, the share capital of the company is limited to £250,000, divided into shares of £1 each.  The shares are allotted and issued to the Minister for Finance from time to time according as capital is required by the board of directors.  The share capital so far issued amounts to £190,880.  This will shortly be increased to £194,130, leaving the amount of share capital unissued at £55,870.</P>
      <P>Since 1946, the company have, from time to time, acquired a number of sires and valuable brood mares.  The stocking of the National Stud has, however, not yet been completed. The board of directors have been emphasising for some years past that to ensure a profitable future for the company the purchase of a staying sire of the highest class would be needed.  Horses of this type are much needed in this country in order to develop the export trade in thoroughbred horses.  Some additional brood mares of the highest class are also required to supplement the stock at the National Stud.</P>
      <P>Realising that the balance of the share capital unissued would be altogether inadequate for the achievement of these aims, the board of directors have been pressing for some time past for a considerable increase in the authorised share capital of the company.</P>
      <P>After full and careful consideration of the financial requirements for the proper development of the National Stud, the Government approved the preparation of a Bill to amend the National Stud Act, 1945, so as to raise to £500,000 the limit of the share capital of the company.  This is the main purpose of the Bill now before the House.  The Bill also deals with one minor matter, namely, that on the suggestion of the board of directors of the company, the Bill proposes to repeal Section 26 of the 1945 Act, which section has been found to be unsuitable in practice, and to replace it by the more flexible provision set out in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> The enactment of this Bill is now urgently necessary following on the recent acquisition of the company of a very valuable horse named Tulyar.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to point out that for some years past, the directors of the Irish National Stud Company have been assiduously searching for a suitable staying sire of the highest class.  As far back as July, 1951, the company were informed that if they purchased a suitable horse, the price of which involved them in expenditure in excess of the company's unissued share capital, the authority of the Government would be sought for the preparation of a Bill to increase the share capital limit of the company. After further representations from the company, and following correspondence between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance, the authority of the Government was obtained on the 1st July, 1952, for the preparation of a Bill to increase the share capital of the company.  This was long before the purchase of Tulyar was thought of.  The point of these remarks is to emphasise that this Bill would have been necessary anyhow in order to enable the company to proceed with their programme for properly stocking and developing the National Stud.</P>
    <P>The breeding of horses in this country is a long-established national industry.  The net value of the export trade in horses in 1951 exceeded the £3,000,000 mark.  Furthermore a substantial proportion of these exports go to the dollar areas.  Exports to these areas in recent times averaged about £200,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The possibility of expanding our export trade in horses, and particularly to the dollar area, has been obvious for some time.  It has, however, been realised that, in order to expand that trade, horses of the highest standard must be produced.  The Government had this in mind in setting up the National Stud Company in 1946.  It is, therefore, the duty of that company to operate a policy designed to develop the industry from the national aspect rather than from the narrower aspect <Col N="1604" /> of an ordinary company or private individual.</P>
    <P>The essentials for success in the breeding of thoroughbred stock are good soils, suitable climate, skill in management, and good breeding stock. In the first three of these, i.e., soil, climate and skill, we are second to no country in the world.  In the fourth, i.e., breeding stock, our position can be substantially improved.  There is, for instance, at the moment the need for more extensive production of really high-class thoroughbreds of the longer distance or staying type.  This fact is fully realised by all those interested in the industry.  The National Stud Company is obviously the organisation best equipped to bring about this improvement. In the purchase of Tulyar they have very definitely taken a step in the right direction and one of which the Government and all others interested in the development of the industry heartily approve.</P>
    <P>The price the company has agreed to pay for Tulyar is admittedly high, but considered from the national point of view it must be regarded as a perfectly sound investment.  A stallion of this sort would, on the average, remain in service for a period of 12 years.  The price of £250,000 to be paid for the horse should therefore be spread over a period of 12 years and would amount to approximately £20,000 per year.  As already stated, the net value of our export trade in horses is about £3,000,000 per year.  The purchase price of Tulyar when extended over the 12 year period is therefore a very small item as compared with the value of our export trade.  In fact the outlay on this horse actually amounts to only two-thirds of 1 per cent, of the total export value of our horses for 12 years at its present level.  While there is, of course, a certain amount of risk involved in this purchase, this risk is small as compared with the great possibilities it opens up for the expansion of the industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from the national aspect of the purchase of Tulyar by the National Stud Company, there are of course compensating factors for the stud itself.  The earning value of Tulyar at <Col N="1605" /> stud is estimated at £16,000 per annum, and may possibly go as high as £20,000 for a period of 12 years.  Furthermore the National Stud Company has some ten very high-class brood mares, some of which will be mated to Tulyar.  The female progeny of such matings will be extremely valuable stock to retain at Tully for stud purposes.  Those not required for this purpose and the colts from such matings, when offered for sale, will undoubtedly fetch very high prices.</P>
    <P>We are in the fortunate position of having secured a very high international reputation for the quality of the race horses we produced.  The produce of Irish studs have over the years won the most valuable races in very many lands, including all the English classics and the most important races in the U.S.A.  In the latter country thoroughbred breeding has in recent times reached an extremely high level, largely due to the fact that breeders in that country purchased from the Aga Khan some years ago three horses: Blenheim, Mahmoud and Bahram.  The three horses in question were bred in the Aga Khan's studs in County Kildare, and during their racing careers before export all three had won Epsom Derbys as well as other very important races.  Both in racecourse performance and pedigree Tulyar is definitely a better horse than any of the three.  For that reason American breeders showed great anxiety to secure Tulyar for their studs. In view of the American interest in the horse we may anticipate very keen demand from that country for his produce when it comes on the market a few years hence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the valuable export trade in horses stud farming has a high labour content; the output per acre is much above average and furthermore the produce in the form of thoroughbred horses is an excellent dollar earner.  As regards labour, a review of some of our leading studs has shown that one man is employed for each 20 acres or so, where in farms of 200 acres and upwards over the country as a whole one man is employed on each 42 acres.  The review has further <Col N="1606" /> shown that the earnings of a stud farm through service fees and yearling sales amount to upwards of £30 per acre as against £12 per acre in output over the country as a whole.  In addition to the earnings from horses there is, of course, on our large studs a considerable turnover from cattle feeding. Furthermore stud farms purchase very large quantities of oats, hay and straw, and at good prices, from farmers in the surrounding districts.  The total amount paid for such items at some of our leading studs would run from £10,000 to £20,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Racing is of course closely associated with breeding and is also a valuable source of employment.  There are at the moment over 2,000 horses in training with a labour content of 1,200 to 1,400 men.  In one large racing establishment the wage bill amounts to upwards of £12,000 per annum, while the purchase of forage amounts to an almost equal sum.</P>
    <P>The values of high-class horses for stud in recent years have been about £120,000 to £160,000.  The horse Nasrullah, sold for export after having been used for some years for service here was about the latter sum.  The horse, The Phoenix, was syndicated at home at about the same sum.  The Aga Khan's horse, Palestine, a good winner for distances not exceeding one mile, is syndicated here at £120,000. The only horse in Europe that approaches Tulyar to any extent in merit is the French horse, Tantieme. This horse is now at stud in France at a fee of £600 which amounts to an earning capacity of £24,000 per annum. While his racecourse performances are really good, his pedigree falls entirely short of that of Tulyar.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the enactment of this Bill is now very urgent and I commend it to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no use closing our eyes to the fact that the proposal to pay £250,000 sterling for a sire horse is an unusual proposal and one calling for very careful consideration and when that consideration comes to be given to the project it should extend not only to the contra arguments but to the arguments in favour of the proposition as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> This proposal was of so exceptional a character that I felt bound to ask myself in prior consultation with my own colleagues in the Fine Gael Party what advice would I have tendered if I were Minister for Agriculture?  The fairest thing I can do now is to report to the House faithfully so far as I can what I would have done if that proposal had been made to me by the Board of the National Stud.  I would have asked the board: Is that a unanimous or a majority recommendation? If it was a majority recommendation, then I would have directed them to dismiss it from their minds.  If it was a unanimous recommendation I would have felt bound to advise the Minister for Finance that his choice lay between purchasing Tulyar or winding up the National Stud because the National Stud in this country could not be run on second best.  If the Minister for Finance had asked me what my advice was as to whether or not the stud should be wound up my advice would have been that the stud should not be wound up, and if our technical experts recommended that this was the best&mdash; and what the Minister for Agriculture says to-day is perfectly true, the directors of the stud have been for many years looking for a sire of staying quality&mdash;I would have accepted the explanation of the exceptional price asked, that the Americans are much interested in blood of this character; and if my experience counts for anything, I can well imagine them bidding for this horse £5,000 or £10,000 more than anyone else would offer.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any use trying to disguise the fact that £250,000 for a racehorse, however good, can fairly be described as a fantastic price but in the bloodstock industry you have got to ask yourself this question&mdash;certainly I would if I were Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;Can you run a national stud with anything but the best?&rdquo;  Secondly, when you come into the field of competition for the best and the price is more than you can afford to pay, in conscience I think you are bound to ask yourself the question: &ldquo;Can I legitimately ask the Government to <Col N="1608" /> keep the National Stud in existence?&rdquo; And I think you would have come to the conclusion the day you could no longer afford to buy the best, to advise the stud to be wound up and the business left in private hands.</P>
    <P>I think it is right to warn the House &mdash;I think, perhaps, the Minister will confirm what I now say inasmuch as he omitted to mention it in his opening observations&mdash;we are, in substance, whatever the Minister's brief says, asked to-day to vote money for the purchase of Tulyar or to refuse money for the purchase of Tulyar.  There is no use in our trying to shoulder off our responsibilities in this matter by saying that if the purchase of Tulyar was not in question, the House would still be asked to vote money for the stud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have come in with this Bill anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept any responsibility which a decision on this involves.  The House is entitled to know before it takes a decision on this matter and to bear this in mind when it gives its vote, that it is inherent in the business of bloodstock breeding that you buy with the best judgment you can secure.  We have good judgment at our disposal in the Board of the National Stud, and with the best judgment you can procure you purchase a sire horse and you pay a quarter of a million pounds for it.  The yearlings of the first year have the value that the world puts on them.  The same is true of his yearlings of the second year, but when the yearlings of the third year come to the sale ring, his yearlings of the first year will be running as two-year-olds.  The value of his third crop of yearlings will be fixed by the performance of the two-year-olds. In the case of Tulyar, owing to the special fact that he is purchased for his staying qualities, judgment in his case may be suspended partially, at least, until the fourth year.  People in the racing world see how the progeny races as three-year-olds, but from that hour forth his value as a sire is settled and we may have discovered we have bought a cab-horse.  I know of no means available to human ingenuity whereby that risk can be avoided.  I want to say, with my eyes wide open <Col N="1609" /> to that risk, I still believe the alternatives before us are to buy this horse or close the stud, and if my advice were sought I would advise not to close the stud.</P>
      <P>When we are asked to pass this Bill I wonder has the Minister been wholly disingenuous when he spoke of our exports of horseflesh being worth over £3,000,000 sterling last year.  Of those exports, how much belonged to that category which might properly be identified with the breeding strain in Tulyar?  Of that £3,000,000 worth of horses, how many can we expect to see contesting with the progeny of Tulyar?</P>
      <P>I do not think it is true to say that the Government and all others heartily approve this purchase.  I think there are a lot of people who disapprove of it and that there are a lot of people who, in good faith, feel it is extravagance. There are a lot of people who have the feeling that the project to pay £250,000 for a horse while there are many unemployed and while there is depression in trade is to do something that a democratic Government should not justify.  I reject that.  There are abundant resources in this country if they were properly used to provide good employment for our people.  It is not for want of any resources that our hands are still lying idle at the present day.  It is not for want of resources that this country is in a state of depression.  It is not for want of resources that we face the crisis of emigration.  There was no unemployment, there was no emigration, there was no crisis when the inter-Party Government disposed of the resources of our people and used them for our people.  But the £250,000 that is spent on Tulyar will fructify no more in the hands of this Government than the hundreds of million pounds they could dispose of if they had the courage to invest them in our country instead of investing them in the other ends of the earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only to throw dust in our people's eyes to say that the use of the £250,000, if it can be justified as an investment in one branch of the live-stock industry of this country, is in any sense inimical to the employment of our people.  On the contrary, if I were <Col N="1610" /> in office to-morrow, I would ask this House to invest £40,000,000 in the agricultural industry and that investment would increase employment and increase the standard of living for every section of our people.  It is only if we can satisfy ourselves that this investment is not in the best interests of the live-stock industry that we can challenge it.  To say we cannot afford it I think is the purest nonsense.  We have plenty of resources if we had the will to use them.  The trouble is not that they are being spent improvidently by purchasing horse-flesh for the development of our bloodstock industry, but that they are being spent by palsied hands who have not the courage to believe that capital investment in our own country pays dividends not only for the well-to-do but for the humblest creature born into any home in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have got to face the fact that there are people who are not easy in their minds on this question.  There are lots of people who have the opinion that, from the point of view of politics, it might serve my purpose much better to try to raise all the stink I could about it and that there is plenty of sentiment down the country which would rally to a campaign of that kind. I believe it would be wrong to do that.</P>
    <P>I believe the Dáil is entitled to demand from me what my attitude would be if I occupied the position of Minister for Agriculture, and I propose to tell the Dáil what I should do.  I first want to ask the Minister some questions with a certain amount of diffidence, though I believe I have a right to do so.  One of the most serious questions is whether it is intended to race this horse this year or next year. I want to make this case.  We are investing £250,000 sterling in a horse's reputation which cannot stand too high.  He has done everything that a horse of his breeding and age could do, and he appears to have everything that a horse of his performances and breeding could claim.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he has nothing to gain, but everything to lose, by racing him this season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I want to make the case to the Minister.  I am altogether in favour of giving the board the widest autonomy possible and I am not prepared to press the Minister to interfere with the board in the exercise of that autonomy but I do not believe the board would ask Oireachtas Éireann for £500,000 and then regard it as presumptuous on the part of Oireachtas Éireann to express an opinion in regard to this matter. I am not asking the Minister to give any directions to the board but I am asking him to give his opinion as frankly and as openly as I am giving mine.  I do not doubt that the board would have a respectful regard for these opinions, even though they might have to disregard them in the discharge of their duty.  I do not think there is any need for anxiety on that score and I think it is a matter to which we are entitled to advert.</P>
      <P>I remember when I was Minister another horse of this kind came on the market.  I do not believe he was a horse of this standing but he was a horse of this character and breeding.  I remember the board, with my approval, considered the payment of a very substantial sum for him.  The owner, meanwhile, permitted him another race in the Derby class in France.  He was beaten by a cat's whisker at the post and his price dropped £50,000.  In fact, our board determined they would not touch him.  He was afterwards bought for a sum of £50,000 less than we would have considered paying for him if he had not suffered that defeat.  I am not, therefore, presumptuous in saying that you are here dealing with a horse which has everything, as he stands at present, if he went to stud this year. You have got to be very sure that you are going to add something very material to his value and reputation before you risk losing all that he has acquired by some fortuitous accident&mdash; a slip on a greasy patch or something of that sort&mdash;in the course of a single race to which he might be committed in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the case can be made that a great many mares with whom it would be desirable to mate this horse have already had arrangements made for <Col N="1612" /> them in the ordinary breeding programme for this year.  If that is so, it makes it all the easier for the stud to use his services for our own stud mares and also perhaps to give an opportunity to small breeders whose breeding arrangements could be more easily dislocated than those of a more fashionable breeder.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I think is immensely important.  A question has often been raised in this House as to what is the reason that sires standing at the National Stud have been made available to Lord Derby, the Aga Khan and a variety of other wealthy breeders and how is that justified.  It is well that we should look for a moment at that problem in the light of our contemplated purchase of Tulyar. When I came to examine that question, I was quite satisfied that the procedure adopted by the Board of the National Stud was prudent and necessary in respect to Royal Charger.  In the case of Royal Charger, the horse was bought much more than is the case with Tulyar on the judgment, the very highly skilled judgment, of the Board of the National Stud.  Their judgment would not at all have received the universal assent in regard to Royal Charger that it has received in regard to Tulyar.  Therefore, their first duty and purpose, once Royal Charger joined the stud, was to establish his name and reputation as a sire and to demonstrate that their judgment in regard to his potentialities was well founded.  To do that they had to ensure that the horse was mated with mares of quality so that he could prove that he was as good a sire as they thought he was.</P>
    <P>These mares were available only from the stables of wealthy people because in order to determine that a mare was the kind of mare which would transmit the qualities that were expected from the sire Royal Charger, the performance of the mare's progeny has to be seen.  That meant that the mare had to be at stud for at least three years before her progeny could be tested in racing.  When the progeny had been tested and had proved themselves of the highest quality, fashionable breeders secured these mares and paid fancy prices for them.  That meant <Col N="1613" /> that it was only breeders like the Aga Khan and the Earl of Derby who usually had such mares.  If you excluded such persons from the principal sire in the National Stud, in effect you excluded the sires of the National Stud from all the best mares in Britain and Ireland.  It was therefore decided that for the first two or three years, one half of the nominations would go to fashionable people at an economic fee and one half of the nominations would be balloted for amongst the relatively small Irish breeders at, I think, a lower fee.  If the horses's potentialities had been demonstrated on the racecourse all the nominations, however, would be balloted for amongst the small breeders.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister can he tell us to-day what policy it is proposed to follow with Tulyar.  The plain fact is that there is a gold mine in Tulyar, because for the first two years before his progeny is tested breeders are going to gamble on the fact that Tulyar's yearlings are worth what they fetch.  The man who has a Tulyar yearling to offer at a sale next year or the year after, is going to sell a pig in a poke and and it is a golden pig and it is a golden poke, to all appearances. Nobody will know until later on whether the pig and the poke are gold bricks or bricks of gold.  Everyone will pay for them in the first two years on the presumption that they are bits of gold.  Who is going to get the nominations this year and next year?  I venture to submit to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;if we are going to be consistent in this matter&mdash; that if the board determines that it is still essential to procure very fashionably bred mares from the wealthier stables for this horse that no more than one-quarter of the total nominations should be made available for that purpose and that three-quarters should be balloted for amongst Irish breeders who have suitable mares to put in the ballot.  I do not press that.  I realise that, perhaps, some technical aspect of this matter may have escaped my attention and which has been urged on the Minister for Agriculture. I am quite satisfied that whatever arrangement has been made with his <Col N="1614" /> approval is the best for the State.  I think, however, it is reasonable to direct the Minister's attention to the matter and to ask him to consider it.</P>
    <P>In the newspaper reports of this transaction it was suggested that the Aga Khan had, in addition to the £250,000 which was the price he set upon the horse, reserved certain nominations for his own mares.  If that is true, it would represent a substantial additional consideration for the horse. If we are voting money for its purchase, we ought to know that.  I can well understand that, in certain circumstances, such a stipulation might be made.  From many points of view the fact that such a stipulation was made would, in itself, enhance the value of the horse because it would be a public testimonial that the breeder and racer of the horse set so high a premium on the horse that he was prepared to bespeak so many nominations at the regular fee.</P>
    <P>I have made my position perfectly clear.  In a matter of this kind I think none of us need regard ourselves as bound by Party affiliations.  Whether or not we purchase Tulyar does not seem to me to be a matter of fundamental policy between the principal Government Party and the principal Opposition Party.  I invite those who accept my view on all sides of the House to support this Bill&mdash;conscious of the risks we take, clearly understanding the bargain we are making and the purposes to which we set our hand.  I think it would be a poor thing for this Parliament and for this country if Deputies on either side of the House were being coerced by the Whips to vote on this issue on the grounds of Party loyalty.  I do not think Party loyalty arises in this matter at all.  If Deputies on either side of the House feel that they cannot, in conscience, endorse the purchase on these terms, I hope they will be afforded every facility for voting in that sense without any suggestion that, in so doing, they have committed any treason on their colleagues or the Party to which they belong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make our position perfectly clear.  The Labour Party are opposed to this Bill.  No matter what fine words are spun around this purchase, the vast majority of the ordinary people of this country are against it.  The Minister for Agriculture made a very determined attempt to wrap the green flag around Tulyar.  He described the tremendous service, in many senses of the word, which this horse is going to give this country.  He carefully avoided, however, making reference to a number of important matters.</P>
      <P>A fortnight ago I took occasion to raise this matter originally in the House and to ask the Minister some questions which I thought were in need of an answer.  I expected to hear some replies to those questions in the course of the Minister's Second Reading speech to-day.  I am still waiting to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's point of view on this purchase is that it demonstrates the Government's complete lack of a sense of proportion in regard to the importance of things.  The Government has seen fit to determine to take from the Exchequer&mdash;an Exchequer which is assembled from an overtaxed people &mdash;£250,000 for the purchase of this horse.  The Government has seen fit to pay £250,000&mdash;and many thousands more, of which we know nothing whatsoever, in incidental expenses&mdash;for the purpose, not of relieving unemployment: we have 90,000 unemployed signing on at the labour exchanges. Every single town in Ireland and every single rural area in Ireland is seriously hit by unemployment.  The Deputies on the Government side of the House are aware of the unemployment position as well as the Deputies on the Labour Benches and on the other Opposition Benches.  We are facing an <Col N="1616" /> unemployment crisis which is sliding still further into the valley of depression with every week that passes: unemployment is increasing at the rate of 1,000 per week.  In the light of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has seen fit to make £250,000 available for the purchase of this horse.  In this instrument now before us, they are proposing to make available £250,000 for the purchase of a horse at a time when we have the greatest ever number of unemployed in need of relief, when industry is sinking faster and faster into depression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when employers are letting men off by the hundred every week, when employers cannot get credit from the banks to pay the wages of their workers, when the housing programme is coming to a grinding standstill in every part of the country. In the face of all these severe difficulties, this Government proposes to pay for a horse what might, to some people, be regarded as a very small sum, but which, to the people of this country, is a very large and a very substantial sum.  A quarter of a million pounds for a horse.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for people who spend the greater part of their lives in the cocoon of politics to forget the real interests of the people.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the Irish bloodstock industry is of tremendous importance to this country.  Neither I nor any other Deputy in my Party would for a moment suggest that any hindrance should be placed on the honest development and promotion of its interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say, however, that there is a time and a place for everything.  I do not think that this step can be justified. In the light of the circumstances in which we are living, with every member of this House receiving requests daily from unemployed people to help them <Col N="1617" /> to obtain jobs and with people being knocked out of employment every other week, a purchase of this sort betrays something that is completely grotesque, to use a favourite expression of Deputy Dillon's.  It shows a lack of touch with the problems that exist. We have suspected for a long time that members of the Government Party have been out of touch with these problems.  I want to say in fairness, not all of them.  I do say, however, that certain of the governing minds of the Government Party have been out of touch with these problems.  It is only a mentality that was completely dead to the facts of the situation, as it exists in this country to-day, that would embark on this project of making £250,000 available in this particular instance.  If times were better, and if we had full employment, or the relatively full employment that we had three and a half years ago, then possibly a case could be made for the expenditure of a very considerable sum of money.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read what people who are alleged to be experts in the racing world have to say in regard to this purchase.  We have been told that the Americans were after this horse, and that if we had not offered this astronomical sum we would have no chance of getting him.  What truth is there in that?  How do we know what the Americans offered, or if they offered anything at all?  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on that.  We have not heard of any announcements from America to that effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the cost of this horse will be approximately £20,000 a year over a period of 12 years.  I wonder would the Aga Khan take £20,000 a year on the chance of this horse remaining in good health and producing worthy progeny?  I wonder would he gamble on the chance that nothing would happen to him which might render him worthless?  It is hardly likely that he would, because the Aga Khan is possibly too good a businessman for that.</P>
    <P>I described this purchase originally <Col N="1618" /> as a gamble.  That is all it is.  It is nothing more than a gamble. People who are influential and knowledgeable in the racing world have written to me and to other Deputies on this matter.  One man who has written to me is a well-known figure in Irish racing.  He rays:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I happen to know that the price to the Irish Stud was bolstered up by the sight of another so-called bid which, in turn, was bolstered up by another bid which I do not believe was ever seriously meant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Irish Stud was bluffed.  That, at any rate, is the view of one person who is not unknown at top level in the racing world.</P>

I propose now to give a quotation from a trade journal which deals with the horse racing industry in England.  I propose to quote from an article by a writer who signs himself &ldquo;Audax&rdquo; and is, I understand, regarded as an expert.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will wait for a while I will slip over to England and get his name.  People like myself have no knowledge of this industry. We are mere amateurs.  We read what the experts write and try to learn from it.  On the question of Tulyar, he says that &ldquo;it must be remembered that not all great horses make great sires&rdquo;.  He says that &ldquo;one can recall Gay Crusader, Golden Myth and a few others which failed dismally.&rdquo;  Amongst these must also be put Trigo who comes from the same family as Tulyar. This family, he says, has, as a matter of fact, a bad record in the matter of stallions.  &ldquo;It has not produced one good one.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts, and it is easy to check on them.  I do not want to deal in great detail with the technical side of this.  I do not profess to know very much about it&mdash;certainly not as <Col N="1619" /> much as some of those sitting behind the Minister.</P>

We have not been told, and it is time that we were, of what reservations there are in regard to nominations. Is it not a fact that the Aga Khan has priority on the first five nominations?

      <P>Nobody could guarantee it.  That is why I say this is no more than a gamble.  The importance of the bloodstock industry has been referred to.  It is an important part of our economy but does it compare in any sense with the agricultural industry as a whole?  Does its employment potential compare in any way with the employment potential of the agricultural industry?  Does it compare with the employment potential of the dairying industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not have occurred to the Minister for Agriculture and the Government that this £250,000 and all the incidental expenses, which will <Col N="1621" /> probably amount to another score of thousands, would have been far better invested in trying to improve the strain of our dairy herds, as has been suggested to me in very many parts of the country, in trying to inject some life into the building industry in the City of Dublin or Cork or elsewhere, in providing employment for workers who are unemployed in any kind of industry, or even in establishing an industry of which we have not as yet experience?</P>
    <P>Can it be seriously suggested that it displays a sense of responsibility on the part of the Government when they spend in this way this huge amount of money, which has been extorted by the oppressive taxes of last year from the taxpayers and from the working people?  This money has been taken from the workers in order that it should be spent in this frivolous manner.</P>
    <P>I am quite ready to accept, and nobody denies, that the directors of the National Stud are correct in their attitude.  Naturally they are anxious to promote the interests of that stud and that enterprise to the best of their ability.  The Minister, however, has a bigger responsibility than the National Stud.  The whole nation should be the Minister's responsibility.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, I think I can say that I speak as well the minds of the vast majority of plain people in the Cities of Dublin and Cork and elsewhere.  They can see no excuse for this wild extravagance on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Where will the nominations for this sire go?  Who will get them?  We witnessed a remarkable event here to-day. Deputy Dillon did not make it clear whether he was representing the Fine Gael Party but Deputy Dillon and the Minister were at one.  We observed the phenomenon&mdash;the rapt attention given to Deputy Dillon by members of the Fianna Fáil Party while Deputy Dillon was making a better fist of defending the purchase of Tulyar than the Minister made.  It was rather unusual.  Coming events cast their shadows.  Deputy Dillon inquired what it was proposed to do in regard to these nominations and suggested to the Minister that only one-fourth <Col N="1622" /> should be reserved for the wealthy stables and that three-fourths of the nominations each year should be made available by ballot or some such system to the smaller breeders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wound up on a note which aroused, I am sure, in many of our minds a question as to what was the main ground for his opposition to the purchase of this horse.  Is it that he really is concerned about the unemployed, or is it because this horse has been purchased, as he says, from an Oriental potentate to whom this amount of money is a mere flea-bite?  That is the extent of the distance from one end of his brain to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to approach this matter from the point of view of common sense and fairness.  The Deputy spoke about letters he has had from many people, including one of the most distinguished and leading horse breeders in the country.  He also quoted from a tipster on horse races in a newspaper.  I have also heard from very many people.  I have heard from one of the leading, if <Col N="1624" /> not the leading, firms engaged in the export of bloodstock from this country and I want to place on record what is in this letter.  Deputy Dunne can have the letter so that he can see it is authentic.  The letter which is dated 16th February, 1953, and addressed to me, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Brown horse Tulyar (1949).</P>
    <P>I regret not being at this office when you called this morning, but my day's work begins at &mdash;&mdash;, where we have 47 horses in training.</P>
    <P>However, as promised, I append below my views regarding the deal for above.</P>
    <P>The shortcomings of breeders were very evident some years ago when such horses were allowed to leave the country as Blenheim, Mahmoud, Bahram and Alibhai.  There was no Irish National Stud in those days and the leading breeders preferred to send their best mares out of the country to be mated with top stallions, and I know of many instances where some of these men paid as much as £1,000 for single nominations.</P>
    <P>The directors of our National Stud are, in my opinion, to be complimented on proceeding so determinedly, and successfully, in the acquiring of this great horse.  For all-round qualities there has been no racehorse during, perhaps, the last 50 years to compare with Tulyar&mdash; beyond question are his intelligence, symmetry, soundness of limbs and constitution, resource and versatility. With ordinary luck his first contingent of yearlings must, to my way of thinking, yield an aggregate of £100,000.</P>
    <P>On the question of value it is interesting to recall the figures at which some stallions have been syndicated in recent years: The Phoenix, £164,000; Persian Gulf, £100,000; Migoli, £100,000; Avenger II, £100,000; Combat, £60,000; Marsyas II, £104,000; Pearl Diver, £80,000; My Love, £150,000; Niccolo Dell-Arca, £152,000; Torbido, £144,000; Dante, £100,000; Alycidon, £120,000; Nimbus, £150,000; Vieux Manoir, £88,000; Supreme Court, <Col N="1625" /> £120,000; My Babu, £160,000; Stardust, £120,000.</P>
    <P>In 1944 &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; bought Nasrullah for £15,000 in equal shares and shortly afterwards sold the horse to &mdash;&mdash; for £19,000.  This temperamental stallion was later disposed of for, I believe, the equivalent of £160,000 when ten years old, and like all those named above could not compare with Tulyar in merit, soundness nor sense.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I consider the purchase justifiable and think it would have been a grave reflection on those chiefly concerned with the bloodstock industry had the opportunity been missed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the names of these horses will ring a bell even in Deputy Dunne's mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must not mention names.  I will hand over the letter to you to read to show that it is an authentic, genuine firm, which is regarded as being the leading blood-stock firm in this country.  That is not from an unknown and unamed individual who writes and says that he talked to Mary So-and-So and to Ann So-and-So and that they would not believe it. These are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment the National Stud and I do so as a Deputy representing a mainly working-class area. Everybody in this country, the masses to whom the Deputy referred, are proud that this is an Irish bred horse and that it is coming home to help the breeding industry in this country in which it was born.  Every man who puts a shilling on a horse knows about this horse and is glad to see it coming home.  I do not know whether the Deputy has taken into account the fact that we regard the important live-stock breeding industry mainly from the point of view of the export potential of it.  I think the House ought to make Deputy Dunne some recompense for the fact that he has helped to advertise further the home of this horse throughout the whole world because of the controversy which he has brought <Col N="1626" /> about in regard to it.  This horse has been written up in every country where people can read and it has brought about great and valuable publicity for this country because of its acquisition for the National Stud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  The Deputy, apparently, cannot compare the value of £164,000 when the pound was worth four dollars with what it is when the pound is only worth 2.80 dollars.  That price was paid for other horses when the pound was equal to four dollars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that Deputy MacBride was on my side in this matter, but apparently he wants to cross-examine.  I have made a statement of fact.  I do not think Deputy MacBride will disagree that £164,000 sterling ten years ago was worth the equivalent of £250,000 to-day.  Deputy Dunne raises his hands in horror because £250,000 is being paid for a horse.  The equivalent in dollars was paid over and over again for horses not so long ago.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dunne says, the purchase of this horse is a gamble.  The purchase of every horse is a gamble.  When a mare is brought to the stud it is a gamble.  Everything connected with horse breeding is a gamble.  The more valuable the horses are the greater the gamble, and when the gamble comes off, the greater the profit.</P>

I am not prepared to say what will be the gamble in connection with the progeny in the second and third years.</P>
      <P>At least Deputy Dillon went to the trouble of trying to weigh the matter sensibly.  Deputy Dunne is amazed because Deputy Dillon talked, as he did to-day, sound common sense and got a reasonably good hearing for it.</P>

      <P>It is true that the National Stud, when considering the purchase of a horse, must be able to prove, as far as proof can be adduced, that it is aiming to get the very best and that it has, in fact, secured the very best.  As far as records go, nobody can deny that this horse is the best that can be got.  Deputy Dunne talked about the horse turning out to be a cab-horse.  We all know of a cab-horse that turned out to be a Grand National winner.  It is a gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> Deputy Dunne reached great heights of eloquence in his indignation, and he asserted that this money was being taken out of the Exchequer, out of the taxation of our people.  This is a capital investment.  The money is not taken out of ordinary revenue.  I do not know whether that will make any difference to Deputy Dunne's song or to the chorus he will put to it from now on, but I think he should at least change his tune.  This capital will be invested in the National Stud.  Like any undertaking run on business lines, the greater the activities the greater the capital requirements.  Capital is not extinguished by the purchase of a particular item.  This horse is a capital item and the National Stud will, of course, increase its capital assets by £250,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne speaks as if not one single penny of State money is being devoted to industry or potential employment. He forgets that £50,000,000 is invested by the State in the electricity undertaking.  There are many millions invested in other undertakings, all of which give employment and help to relieve unemployment.  I take it the Deputy was here to-day at question time.  Was he not amazed to hear that the Leader of the Labour Party, when he was a Minister, unanimously agreed with the Cabinet in rejecting the expenditure of State money, an expenditure which would have given considerable employment in the City of Dublin?  There was no outcry about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne is one of those who ridicules large-scale Government expenditure for the relief of unemployment. I hope to see our Government very soon make available a large sum of money to deal with the Dublin Castle problem and incidentally provide large-scale employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to my opinion just as Deputy Dunne is entitled to his, but Deputy Dunne gives his opinion as a matter of fact and in the form of an assertion.  Deputy Dunne said this was a scandalous purchase at a time when our industries are perishing.  I deny that our industries are perishing but, even if that <Col N="1630" /> were true, would it be right to allow the horse-breeding industry to perish? Is it not quite clear that this industry will be strengthened and revivified by the purchase of this horse?  All of us who are in favour of this project hope that it will turn out as good a sire as it was a racehorse.  Deputy Dunne almost tried to sabotage the horse. He quoted from some individual who writes under a <i>nom de plume</i> to show the dangers inherent in the purchase of this animal.  No matter who bought it, all of us would wish that it would continue to be a successful horse and continue to bring credit to this country. It is an Irish-bred horse and people should not try to put doubts into the minds of others and particularly into the minds of those who might be considering securing nominations during the first or second year.  It will be a gamble in the first years.  After that people will know and they will be able to decide whether or not to send their mares to this sire because of the experience gained by others.  It will be time enough then to judge performance and not try to force the public now into believing that the horse will be a failure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy brought out some reference to the dam side, never once a winner produced.  The fact is that Tulyar with the breeding it has, which is recognised to be what is called in racing language the most brilliant breeding, has proved to be a most brilliant horse, and let us hope it will be a most brilliant sire.  Deputy Dunne made a retort to an interjection by Deputy McGrath, the Lord Mayor of Cork, which brought great laughter from us.  I wonder is Deputy Dunne jealous that he could not get the nomination which Deputy McGrath got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wanted the purchase of this horse to have a guarantee of success attached to it. That was too much for Deputy McMenamin who said you cannot get a guarantee of that nature.  That is the approach we heard about this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the manner in <Col N="1631" /> which the National Stud operates is this.  They select a certain number of mares of the very highest breeding to mate with their good sires.  They ask people then to apply for nominations. From the nominations they get, which may be many hundreds, they first of all cull mares which they think are not suitable for mating with the particular sire.  Having culled what they would call unsuitable mares, they put the rest in the hat for the ordinary breeders, large and small, and where the small breeders are concerned, they are pulled out of the hat and if the small breeder gets it it is at a reduced fee, whereas the big wealthy stables, to which Deputy Dunne has been referring as if it was a privileged class, a preference to a preferred class, pay the higher prices where they have the best mares in order that a reduced sire fee can be subsidised for the smaller and poorer of our breeders.</P>
    <P>The Deputy does not seem to know as much about the running of the National Stud as he should have known when he stood up to oppose this particular Bill.  I began by saying I recognised the fact that I represented mainly a working-class constituency.  I know that every attempt will be made to misconstrue and to abuse the situation, particularly where there are working-class people and many unemployed. It will be said the purchase of this horse is affecting their bread and butter.  On the last occasion when Deputy Dunne spoke in this House he said with a most magnificent Shakesperian gesture: &ldquo;We asked for milk and they gave us Tulyar.&rdquo;</P>

I believe that the development of our National Stud in this manner will so improve it that in years to come we will not be talking of £3,000,000 as our maximum exports of blood-stock, of which £200,000 is in dollars, but that it will be far greater.</P>
      <P>I believe that in sending large numbers of Tulyar's progeny to our own sales at Ballsbridge, it will keep at home a lot of our other good class animals which have to be sent to Newmarket for sale because it is to Newmarket at present that the main buyers go.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe has stressed the fact several times in his speech that the purchase of Tulyar is a gamble.  It was not a remark that slipped out by chance.  He stressed it and made it very clear on his own behalf and on behalf of the Government Party which he is supporting that this expenditure of £250,000 is a gamble.  I am thankful to Deputy Briscoe for clarifying the position in that regard.  It is the first time that I have heard it expounded from the Government side that the Government is justified in using the people's money for the purpose of a gamble.  As a matter of fact it comes to me as a complete surprise and as a departure from established practice for any Minister or any Government Department <Col N="1633" /> to indulge in anything in the nature of a gamble.  Of course, Deputy Briscoe may be accustomed to applying in that way sums of money owned by various people in which it does not matter a whole lot.  However, while I have no knowledge of the matter offhand I doubt if in this particular case it is constitutional.  We will no doubt hear from people who are better versed in constitutional law.</P>

We have heard that no worth-while scheme could be entertained, and we were told that it was necessary even to sell the machinery which the last Government bought to carry out the land rehabilitation project.  But now, when it comes to a gamble, the Government <Col N="1634" /> appear to have plenty of money, just as they had sufficient money, at the time that they refused the old age pensioners an increase of a miserable 2/6, to think of embarking on a project to erect new Houses of Parliament at a cost of £13,000,000.

I am interested in the breeding of high-class live stock in this country, and I have a keener appreciation of the value of good live stock than Deputy Briscoe ever had.  It is no trouble, apparently, to the present Government to come in here and demand £250,000 for the purchase of this horse, but why is the Government taking such a long time to tell the milk producers the price they are going to pay them?  Are they taking any steps to spend £250,000 to promote the production of beef or milk?  Listening to the Minister moving the Second Reading of this <Col N="1636" /> Bill, I could not help thinking that the Civil Service must regard this Bill with a very jaundiced eye as being the particular piece of horse-flesh that knocked them out of the arbitration award.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is about time we put this discussion back into its proper perspective.  I could not disagree more with anything than I disagree with Deputy Blowick.  I do not think that Deputy Blowick has addressed his mind to this Bill at all; <Col N="1637" /> I think it is unfortunate that in a serious national situation, where we have an inept and incompetent Government dealing with unemployment, we are dealing with that problem in a wrong atmosphere.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to do one thing only.  It proposes to increase the capital of the National Stud.  We know that the main purpose of that increase in the immediate future is to complete the deal for the purchase of Tulyar.  I believe that the purchase of Tulyar is one of the finest decisions that the National Stud could take.  I shall try to prove conclusively why I think so.</P>
      <P>I have heard talk about gamblers.  I have heard Deputy Blowick say that he will not associate with anything that is a gamble.  The very establishment of the National Stud itself, once it went into breeding, once it took over the land at Tully, can be described as nothing but a gamble&mdash;if that is the interpretation you want to put on a State effort to increase the level of your bloodstock.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister, inadvertently, and the members of the House in general, have been led away completely from the basic argument that must be at issue in this case. Let us consider the facts.  The National Stud is going to increase its capital from £250,000 to £500,000.  It has very valuable properties.  We already have a concrete indication in this country of how shrewd, practical and useful to the national effort the advice of the Board of the National Stud has proved to be.  Deputy Dillon referred to the purchase by the National Stud some years ago of a horse called Royal Charger.  There was a good deal of scepticism and criticism when that horse was purchased at a price then considered very excessive in view of the horse's performance on the racecourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never has anything been more justified than that purchase.  I would say that the use of the stallion and its ultimate achievement is a real tribute to the judgment and foresight of the people who run the National Stud. <Col N="1638" /> In Tulyar you have a completely different proposition.  Let people make what capital they like out of side issues, I want to say that there is no horse in the world nor has there been for generations with the racecourse performance of Tulyar.  Come away from that altogether.  His blood line is impeccable.  His breeding is the choicest you will find.  The actual conformation, configuration and general shape of the horse, even though it is considered by some to be slightly on the small side, cannot be flawed.  I think it is unreasonable, unfair and, in fact, a distortion to try to suggest that there is any balance against that horse's proving at stud a most valuable and useful sire.  It is true that the horse might turn out to be infertile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That could happen. What the House seems to forget, however, is that there is no doubt at all that that is one of the horse's activities that can completely be insured against. We cannot insure against the horse's not being a success at stud but certainly we can insure against his being infertile.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an insurance agent, with due respect.  Consider Tulyar's potential earning, if he lives up in any way to the performance that he has given.  Consider his earning potential for the National Stud itself&mdash;leaving out altogether the question of what fees he may earn for the service of mares outside the National Stud.  Say the National Stud mates six, seven, eight, nine or ten of its own choice mares with Tulyar.  Let us consider what has been described as the &ldquo;gold mine period&rdquo; of the untried first two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the earning potential for the National Stud itself of the yearlings to be thrown by those mares in the two years?  I venture to suggest, without any question of gambling at all, that if Tulyar is fertile at stud and if the National Stud&mdash;exercising, as it has exercised in the past, its own discretion in the choice of mares for its stallions&mdash;<Col N="1639" /> gets anything like six, seven or eight yearlings per year for that two years, the sale of these yearlings in the sales rings will make a very effective return towards the diminution of the capital expended on the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
    <P>It is true that the purchase of Tulyar can be twisted into something that seems profligacy in the circumstances. However, I take my stand on the basis that there are in this country adequate resources at the hands of the Government to enable them to deal with problems urgently needing attention. At the same time, there are still sufficient resources there to enable this country to take certain action&mdash;as it is advised on this occasion by an independent body of people presided over, as chairman, by the man who brought into all parts of the world the famous Irish jumper that made the Irish Army jumping team the envy of the entire world.  I have not got the fool-hardiness to question the judgment of the people who constitute the Board of the National Stud.  Their running of the stud, their contribution to the improvement of the bloodstock of this country, speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon is sound in one thing&mdash;that the Minister had to decide on the issue.  Having got a unanimous recommendation&mdash;as we have reason to believe he got from the stud&mdash;that we wanted this horse, I think the Minister was coerced either to wind up the idea of a National Stud altogether or to concede to the board's wishes and buy the best horse which is available in the world to-day for that purpose.  What is the position? I am absolutely <i>ad idem</i> with Deputy Dillon, and I would press on the Minister for Agriculture that once Tulyar becomes the possession of the Irish National Stud, which is a semi-State organisation&mdash;once he becomes, through their stewardship, the property of the Irish people&mdash;he should not be raced any more but should be sent to stud duties forthwith.</P>
    <P>I believe that, gamble as it may be described, the balance weighs heavily in favour of Tulyar's being equally successful at stud as he has been on the racecourse.  If that belief becomes <Col N="1640" /> a reality, there is no doubt at all that the investment of £250,000 of Irish capital in this horse will repay a rich dividend to the National Stud itself and to the general bloodstock industry outside the National Stud.  I must confess that I do not like Fianna Fáil, and never have, but in this particular instance I am not ashamed to say that I am glad to see the repatriation of Tulyar.  Having got on to that line of country, if they would repatriate some of the funds which they have so badly invested in other directions, they might be able to deal with problems which are not really germane to the issue we are now discussing but which must be brought in inevitably by those who feel that there is profligacy in the expenditure of £250,000 on a racehorse when more and more people are becoming unemployed and are leaving the country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the House to discuss the proposition on its merits and in its relationship to the bloodstock industry. I ask Deputies to remember that infinitely inferior horses in performance, horses that could never hope to have the potential of Tulyar as a sire, have been syndicated for sums up to £160,000 and £170,000&mdash;horses with not such a meritorious performance on the racecourse as Tulyar.  I have the feeling that we are inclined to be too apprehensive about the future of Tulyar.  Some Deputies have spoken about the female dominance in the line of Tulyar's breeding, and have suggested that there might be an inherent danger there.  I ask, is there any reasonable basis for the belief that, in some way, Tulyar is going to fold up when he is taken from racecourse duties?  The opinion of the experts is that he is a highly intelligent horse, with tremendous gameness and a stout heart.  His performance on the racecourse indicates that he has the capacity to stay.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see, beyond, say, the ordinary hazards associated with all classes of bloodstock, any reason for serious apprehension that Tulyar will not be a most successful sire.  I am taking the foursquare line of supporting the view of the National Stud Board.  I want, if <Col N="1641" /> possible, to take this purchase out of the argument into which it was projected, and to say deliberately that the matter is not being discussed on its merits.  I suppose that is due to the political circumstances that exist&mdash; that the Minister for Finance, in the altimate analysis, has to give his sanction to the expenditure of this capital sum.  In view of that, I suppose people are inclined to say that this represents a nice lack of balance&mdash;to invest £250,000 in Tulyar, while no serious investment is made by an Irish Government in solving the problems of unemployment, emigration, depression in trade, instability in industry and various other things.  What I want to say is that the purchase of Tulyar in no way impedes the Government from doing its bounden duty.  Our resources are infinitely greater than £250,000.</P>
    <P>When people talk about gambles, I think we should look on the purchase of Tulyar with a certain amount of realistic hope.  There is much more hope, certainly, in his purchase than in the gamble of £500,000 in a farcical transatlantic air venture.  I do not care who gets the £250,000, whether it be an Oriental potentate or anybody else.  The purchase was made by a responsible body of people in this country, the members of the Board of our National Stud.  I am prepared to accept their judgment, acting on their long experience.  For years they have been looking for horses of staying qualities, horses that would stay a mile and a mile and a half.  They want that particular type of asset for the stud, and in their considered judgment they have invested £250,000 in Tulyar because they believe that he is going to be of benefit to the National Stud.  I believe that we in the Dáil should endorse their courageous policy.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for those particular people that this whole discussion has been projected into an unreal situation where, maybe, their courage in giving disinterested advice to the Minister for Agriculture may come in for criticism that it does not really deserve.  I believe we are too inclined to equate what is the earning power of Tulyar as a stallion with those who are going to get nominations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> The purpose of this Bill, of course, is to provide for the immediate payment of a very large sum of money for a horse which will go into the general pool of the assets of the National Stud. By improving its female stock in the National Stud over a period of years, by building up the capital value of the brood mares there, I believe that Tulyar, through his service, will more than compensate for this investment. We are inclined to take the view here that there is something wrong in paying £250,000 for the best horse in the world, and that is an Irish horse. We are inclined to take that view because a situation has been allowed to deteriorate in every facet of the national economy by the ineptness of the present Government.  They have had the dead hand on many things.  In this particular case they are acting on the advice of people in whom I have supreme confidence, people whose past performance on the Board of the National Stud merits the highest commendation in this House.  I think that we would not be doing our duty here if we did not give our whole-hearted support and good wishes to the Board of the National Stud for the courage and foresight it has shown in the purchase of Tulyar.  We all believe it will reap a munificent harvest for Irish bloodstock generally.</P>
    <P>As regards nominations to Tulyar, I would press on the Minister that as many as possible should be made available to the smaller type of breeder with good approved mares.  It is true, of course, that it will be of immense value to the sire, in his early days, to have the choicest mares&mdash;brood mares of proven worth.  At the same time, I suggest to the Minister that, on making this big sum of money available to the Board of the National Stud, he should make the strongest representations to it to reserve as many nominations as possible of Tulyar for the small type of breeder.</P>
    <P>I regret very seriously that this debate, coming at this time, takes the question of the purchase of Tulyar out of its proper perspective.  The issues are simple from the point of view of a person who wants to take an honest decision.  First of all, what are we buying?  We are buying, on the recommendation <Col N="1643" /> of an independent body, the Board of the National Stud, a horse for sire duties.  What horse are we buying?  There is one thing on which there can be no difference in this House: we are buying the greatest horse in the world to-day.</P>

The question is, can we afford to pay what has been described as the greatest price ever for the best horse that is available?  It is a sorry day for this country if we have reached the stage in our resources that we cannot afford to invest £250,000 capital in the upward grading of two-year-old and three-year-old flat-racing stock.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne has been talking about this money as something extracted from the taxpayer.  This is not money that will be paid out of taxes.  This is a capital investment by the State in the National Stud Company, and it may well be, if we had the real facts of the National Stud, that it is under-capitalised at the moment.  I believe it is.  I believe that the actual addition of £250,000 in ready cash to the National Stud for the purchase of this horse will merely bring its capitalisation a bit nearer to what it is in reality.  The National Stud is the owner of very, very valuable land, very, very valuable buildings, very, very valuable stallions and very, very valuable mares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we say &ldquo;Can we afford it?&rdquo; we are losing sight of the fact that we are putting capital into what has already proved to be a very fine undertaking from the national point of view. It has been a fine commercial undertaking and it has been an excellent undertaking from the point of view of <Col N="1644" /> the service it has been able to give the Irish bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>This is an investment of £250,000, and I am trying to impress upon my friends in the Labour Party that this particular expenditure, while it is big and looks abnormal in the situation of Government ineptitude with regard to other problems, is in fact being slightly distorted because of the multitude of other national problems.</P>
    <P>I believe that we can afford to pay it.  I believe it is a sound investment in a sound company.  I believe that with any reasonable luck it will prove a really worth-while investment.  I sincerely hope so.  I sincerely hope that Tulyar may prove to be the sire that will put us into the keenest competition with British and French breeds when it comes even to the Derby and the classics of other countries.  The one thing we are looking for in the bloodstock industry in this country at the moment is that small balance between nearly great and great in our two-year-old and three-year-old stock. I hope Tulyar may be the forerunner to Irish-bred colts who in the years to come will play a predominant part in the classic competitions not only of Ireland but of England and France.  I believe that we are giving Irish bloodstock that chance by this investment.</P>
    <P>It is in the sincerity of that belief that I am urging upon this House that the problem should be approached from the point of view of the benefit and the real potential, even taking into account the element of chance that must exist when you send a horse to stud, as to whether he will be successful or not.  Taking the rough with the smooth and trying to view the problem on the basis of whether or not we can afford to pay the price, I feel that the price is as good a price as we could have got this particular horse at in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Maybe it will turn out to be too dear.  We do not know.  Maybe it will turn out, as a previous purchase for the National Stud did, to be a very reasonable price to pay.  Let the House view it in that way, that it is an increase in capital for a semi-State company who have other assets.  The <Col N="1645" /> repayment of that capital ultimately will not depend entirely on Tulyar or on Tulyar's capacity as a sire.  It will depend also on the efforts of a number of already well-proven sires in the National Stud and some most useful brood mares.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill.  The debate on this Bill is not the occasion for pressing the Government or arguing other and more important national crises that are around the corner.  I do not think the £250,000 that will be put up by way of capital to the National Stud in any way impedes the Government from using the resources of this country immediately to solve far more important problems that arise.  I will say to my colleagues on this side of the House, when they approach this problem, not to condemn the purchase of Tulyar because of the general ineptitude of the Government in other directions. Tulyar goes to serve a general national purpose and I hope he will be successful in considerably enhancing the prestige of this country and increasing the value of our two-year-old and three-year-old stock, to compete on the flat in future.</P>
    <P>I wish every success to that effort. If Deputy Dunne thinks the Minister is trying to wrap Tulyar in a green flag, I hope Tulyar, having been repatriated, may be the progenitor of many horses that in many lands will raise a green flag, where the first-class ribbon of a classic race is concerned.</P>

      <P>When I came into this House at six minutes past five, Deputy Dunne delivered himself of the following statement: &ldquo;A person like myself with a very amateurish knowledge of bloodstock and horses ...&rdquo; I do not know exactly what he said after that but he confessed in those words that he did not know very much about bloodstock.  He certainly proved it.  He talked about extravagance, extortion, the oppressive curse of the Fianna Fáil Government, purgatory, and what have you.  I think he was well answered by a Deputy from his own side of the House.  I regret very much indeed that Deputy Collins, having pointed out that much of what Deputy Dunne said was irrelevant, <Col N="1646" /> should himself have hung half a dozen irrelevancies on it, but he made a very excellent case for the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that a proud, intelligent and courageous racehorse should be attacked in this House by Deputy Blowick.  Deputy Blowick said that it was the first time he ever heard of a Government expending money and saying they would take a gamble. What did the Government ever do except take a gamble?  Year after year and day after day they did it. They did it when they set up the National Stud.  They did it when they passed the Congested Areas Act which Deputy Blowick supported.  What did Deputy Blowick do when he got an opportunity of voting on a Fianna Fáil project to sell Department of Agriculture machinery?  He talked about it to-day and said that we had to sell the machinery because we were bankrupt, that Fianna Fáil said we were bankrupt. Deputy Blowick went into the smoking room and refused to vote when he had the chance.  He wants to fool the people of Mayo with this sort of talk.  There is no use in prolonging the argument.  It is as plain as a pikestaff that this is one of the best things the Government could do.  This is an Irish bred horse which is coming back to Ireland to be an ornament to the bloodstock industry, which is one of our main industries and which is recognised to be of a very high standard.</P>

It is very well known that the Irish edition of the <i>Daily Mail</i> goes to press at about 8 p.m.  It is also, I think, rather well known that this House does not normally discuss anything on the Adjournment until 10.30.  It is a matter of record that Deputy Dunne stood up in this House on the occasion of his raising this matter on the Adjournment at the hour of 10.30, 2½ hours after the Irish edition of the <i>Daily Mail</i> had gone to press.  Will Deputy Dunne inform me and the House how it is that the debate on the Adjournment contrived to find itself in the front page of the <i>Daily Mail</i> the following day? There is only one answer to that, and that is that Deputy Dunne took the precaution of going to somebody who represents that paper at 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening to make sure that only his version of what happened on the Adjournment would find its way into the columns of the <i>Daily Mail.</i></P>

He has abused his position as a Deputy in order to try to convince the people who are unemployed or who are looking for something to which they think they are justly entitled that the Government in purchasing Tulyar are doing something which is contrary to their interests.  It is not true that this Government in purchasing Tulyar are doing anything contrary to the interests of the people who are represented by Labour Deputies.  It is not true that they are doing anything contrary to the interests of anybody in this country.  It may be said that by doing this they have gone as near as possible to ensuring that the prestige of Irish bloodstock will, if possible, be higher than it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I will yield to no one here in relation to my ignorance of racing and betting and I am, therefor, unqualified to express any views as to the merits of Tulyar.  I am prepared to accept the views put forward by the Minister, by Deputy Briscoe, by Deputy Dillon and Deputy S. Collins who seem to be the chief protagonists <Col N="1650" /> of the purchase of Tulyar that, at best, this is a gamble of £250,000.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for a different reason from the reasons advanced by those who are in favour of it.  I welcome it because it confirms me in the view I have held over the past 12 months or more.  It confirms the view that the Government is in no way short of money.  It is quite obvious that if the Government found itself in financial difficulties of any kind it would not for one moment consider the spending of £250,000 on the purchase of a horse, a transaction described as a complete gamble.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill as conclusive proof that the Government and the State finds its coffers pretty full.</P>
      <P>There is no shortage of money for development purposes, even for development purposes in the nature of a gamble.  This Bill proves that conclusively. I think every Deputy should breathe sighs of relief at that situation because we have become so used to gloomy speeches about our state of bankruptcy, about the inability of the Government to find even the pay of its own civil servants, about the reports from the Central Bank warning us of the danger we were in, that it is refreshing now to find that apparently all these gloomy speeches and reports are completely devoid of foundation.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill from that point of view.  I do not know whether or not the purchase of a racehorse for £250,000 is a good investment but I am not prepared to support a proposal to spend £250,000 on a racehorse while other projects of national development are being shelved or postponed because of lack of money.  I am prepared to make a gambling offer to the Minister.  I am prepared to support his Bill on condition that he makes available £250,000 for the purchase of premium bulls to improve our cattle population and our dairying industry plus an equal sum for the improvement of agriculture generally. If we are in a position to give £250,000 for a racehorse we should be in a position to give £250,000 for the improvement of agriculture.</P>

The Minister should go back to his Government now and ask for the authority to give the assurances I have requested.  Deputy Briscoe urged, and I think other Deputies argued on the same lines, that £250,000 now amounted to less than £120,000 a few years ago.  Probably Deputy Briscoe is quite right in that and if that is the basis on which Government policy is being framed and public expenditure is being estimated, the same principles should apply in relation to wages and earnings generally. If money has depreciated at such a rapid rate in the course of the last few years surely the wages and earnings of State employees have depreciated just as rapidly to the same extent.</P>

In circumstances where the economic position of the country was favourable, in circumstances where the country was looking for an outlet for investment, then by all means there might be a case to be made for the investment in this racehorse. I am not qualified; I know nothing about it; I am prepared to accept everything the Minister and Deputy Dillon have said about the horse, but they all agree that it is just a gamble.</P>

      <P>There are times when possibly it would be desirable to make an investment of this nature even if it is an investment or gamble on a racehorse, but I do not think this is such a time, at least not having regard to the general policy which the Government has been pursuing and has been enunciating.  I certainly welcome the introduction of the Bill, though I oppose it unless I get these assurances, because it seems to be conclusive proof that the State is remarkably well off and that the gloomy stories we heard are devoid of all foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that my Party are not averse to supplying money to improve our bloodstock industry.  We realise that the National Stud has a commercial value.  We also realise that it gives to this country a prestige which increases the value of racehorses born in it.  In opposing this Bill, we do so not because we wish to injure the National Stud but because we wish to say that now is not the time.  With over 80,000 unemployed in Ireland, we say that no Minister should offer to gamble away £250,000.  It is for that reason that we in the Labour Party oppose this Bill.  This country is too small.  This country is too heavily taxed.  To quote the Taoiseach it is &ldquo;groaning under taxation&rdquo;; yet the Minister calmly stands up and introduces a measure that is to pay away £250,000 for one single animal, an animal that, God forbid, could be dead in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a strange thing to see that this country, a country groaning under taxation, a country with over 80,000 unemployed, can still afford to outbid the richest country in the world for the purchase of a sire.  Tulyar may improve <Col N="1655" /> the stock of this country.  It is to be presumed he will, but very little improvement will take place in the bloodstock of the very small breeder of this country.  I have in my hand a paper dated 29th January, 1952, showing a group of National Stud owners at a meeting in Dublin.  You would be surprised, if you would go through the names of these individuals, how very few Murphys, O'Haras, or any other Irish names you would find.  You will get &ldquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Silcox&rdquo; and other names like that.  I suggest that the use of Tulyar will be confined to those stud managers' nominees, to the ascendancy people who are still remaining in Ireland.  If the Minister for Agriculture takes pleasure in purchasing something for these people while there are 88,000 people unemployed, then I wish him well with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the horse-breeding industry is responsible for an income of over £3,000,000 per annum. That is quite correct, but it is not correct to say that horse racing of itself is responsible for it.  Included in that £3,000,000 is the money paid for the old horses sent across to Belgium and to other countries to be killed to our eternal disgrace.  It does not do to take the round figure of all horse prices in this country, simply put it down on one side, compare against that the price paid for Tulyar, and try to adduce from that fact that it is a fair proposition.  Whether or not Tulyar has been bought too dear, whether or not the risk of racing him is one that should or should not be taken, I do not propose to express an opinion.  I have very little knowledge of horse breeding, very little knowledge of horse betting.  However, I do say that as a protest against the present position, as a protest in the name of the people of this country who are unemployed in my constituency, I am prepared to vote against the Bill introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has covered many aspects of the question at issue.  We are discussing whether the National Stud should be entitled to increase its capital to £500,000.  As <Col N="1656" /> a background to that discussion, it is of course common knowledge that the National Stud has entered into arrangements for the purchase of this sire, Tulyar.  I think we can all agree that the purchase of this sire could not be carried out unless the Dáil, in fact, approved of this Bill and gave sanction to the proposed purchase.  I should like to make it clear that I am not competent to question, and I do not propose to question, the judgment of the National Stud in purchasing Tulyar.  They have their job to do, they are well fit to do their job, and I am prepared to assume that their decision is a good one.  I am more concerned now with the question whether or not the money necessary to purchase this sire should be raised in ordinary taxation or otherwise from the people of this country.  I think that is a very serious question for us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested from the Government Benches that the purchase of Tulyar is a sound capital investment, that it may be a gamble but that it is a gamble worth taking and that the return in years to come will certainly justify the investment.  That may be so; I am sufficiently ignorant of the industry to be impressed by what has been urged by the Minister, by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies with regard to the soundness of the investment in Tulyar but I do join with other Deputies in questioning our right to gamble in this way.  It has been said that there will be a rich return in two years or four years' time.  A rich return to whom?  I have heard Deputies state that here as if the mere fact that yearlings in two years' time will be sold at a phenomenal figure is going to make my lot or the lot of any other Deputy better.  Is that so?  To speak in racing parlance, we cannot go round in blinkers and ignore the fact that the bloodstock industry is an industry run by wealthy men.  There may be comparatively few of them who have the wealth or the fortune of the Aga Khan or persons of that type but they are all men of substance.  It is they undoubtedly who will benefit either immediately or in the near future by the presence at stud in this country <Col N="1657" /> of an outstanding sire like Tulyar. They will get a very substantial return. The progeny, the House is assured, in two or three years' time will be worth far more than the weight of the Aga Khan in gold.  That is as it may be but where is the return to the ordinary people of the country?</P>
    <P>It may be urged by the Minister that a profitable prosperous bloodstock industry will in turn benefit the country. I do not know that is so.  It may be but I should like to hear this problem discussed from that point of view.  I should like to know how the possible development of the bloodstock industry in the near future is going to benefit those unemployed or to create more unemployment in the industry itself. It is from that point of view we should discuss this question because we have heard&mdash;and again, we cannot close our eyes to this fact&mdash;a member of the Government proposing a capital development project, the only project of a capital nature proposed by this Government since their return to office. There is that background of failure to invest money in other lines while they propose to do it in this particular subsidiary branch of the agricultural industry.  Certainly before I give my approval to this proposal I shall be anxious to know in what way the people of this country will benefit as a result of a better price being paid in future for yearlings or other progeny of Tulyar.  I do not believe that there will be any return to the ordinary people.  I can see that those who breed racehorses, who can afford to run them, who can afford to gamble and to do all the things that many of us would like to do if we had money, will have a new era opened for them by the advent of Tulyar to this country.  For that reason I should like to suggest that if Tulyar is a worth-while investment it should be an investment made by those who stand to gain from it.</P>
    <P>I think the purchase of Tulyar on the advice of the National Stud and by the stud should be financed and could be financed by the organisation of the bloodstock industry itself.  It is not impossible to imagine small breeders here&mdash;I am speaking of comparatively small breeders who are <Col N="1658" /> given the opportunity of bringing their mares to Tulyar and who know that the return in the next two years certainly is going to be substantial&mdash; pooling their resources in a syndicate for the purchase of this sire.  It has been done time and time again.  Not so very long ago, a sum of £90,000 less than the price paid for Tulyar was raised by a syndicate for the purchase of a sire.  I think the Minister would have been serving the country far better if he had come into this House to-day with a Bill to organise the bloodstock industry in whatever way he might think advisable to enable a pool of money to be raised for the purchase of great sires such as we are discussing now.  I do not think in present circumstances and with the introduction that the proposal has been given by the Minister that we should be so complacent as to regard this as a legitimate object for the expenditure of the people's money.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that ever before in the history of this Parliament has a Minister of State come in to ask for the voting of money on what he himself describes as a gamble.  I think it is asking far too much of Deputies representing different parts of this country to sit patiently and vote the money he requires for a gamble.  I do not think it is a legitimate expenditure.</P>

      <P>If the case is going to be presented in that way, then I think the Minister will find considerable difficulty in even persuading his own backbenchers to support this proposal.  I do suggest that some effort should be made to organise the industry to finance this project themselves. I do not think that Deputies in this House who have pointed to existing circumstances in this country can be blamed for doing so when they are asked to vote this money to assist&mdash; it appears to assist&mdash;a particular small industry and a particular small section of the community.  There are undoubtedly far more worth-while objects of this expenditure.</P>
      <P>While I agree that the proposal to bring this sire back to this country&mdash; to buy it&mdash;is a very worthy one and while I think it is of the utmost importance that the bloodstock of this industry should be built up, I do believe that we should always put first things first.  I do not believe in this connection that we are doing it to-day. I think that, apart from not going around in blinkers, it is also important that Deputies should not go round the place with their ears stuffed as I am afraid some Deputies' ears appear to be.  I would like to inform the Minister that this proposal made under the existing circumstances in this country has aroused a storm of criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know absolutely nothing about it, and I doubt if the <Col N="1660" /> Minister knows anything about it.  In any event, I know what I am saying now&mdash;that there is very serious criticism of this proposal.  If the proposal is a good one, as the Minister seems to think and as other Deputies seem to think, then surely he should make some effort to finance it through those who are going to derive the benefit. Even if Tulyar's progeny in two years' time are worth all the gold in the world there will still be unemployment in this city, there will still be unemployment in my constituency and there will still be problems to be solved for the general agricultural industry.  The appreciation in the value of the Irish bloodstock will be in no way translated into a solution of the other problems facing the people themselves.  Those are facts.</P>
      <P>I think that what I am saying will find ready acceptance on all sides of this House.  I think that the fallacy in the case made by the Minister is that he is asking the people generally, those who suffer now from the problems of unemployment, those in agriculture who suffer from particular problems of the agricultural industry, to foot the bill for the purchase of Tulyar when from that purchase they can derive no benefit.  That does not appear to me to be good sense.  I suggest to the Minister, as an individual Deputy, to take back this Bill, and if he wants the goodwill of the House in the purchase of Tulyar, let him take that back also, but let him see, negotiate and consult with those interested in the bloodstock industry itself.  Let him come back to this House and do what is being done for other industries already.  Get those interested in the industry to step together and finance their own problems.</P>
      <P>That is the only way it should be done.  It is the only sensible way of doing it.  It is cod and nonsense, in present circumstances, to come in here and ask the ordinary taxpayer to foot the bill as the Minister now proposes to do.</P>

      <P>The prestige of Irish horse racing is something that cannot be looked upon too lightly.  The Irish horse has kept Ireland on the map under very adverse circumstances.  I feel very, very proud and I congratulate the Minister and the members of the National Stud on their courage in going one step further to ensure that the prestige of the Irish horse is kept before the world.</P>
      <P>It is quite true to say that the chasing blood has been almost entirely responsible for that.  We have had, unfortunately, very few long distance racehorses who have brought honour or money to this country.  The Irish chaser is famous all over the world.  Some day, when the progeny of Tulyar race on the Irish turf, the English turf, the American or French turf, we feel certain they will bring equal credit to this country as the Irish steeplechasers brought in the past.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Higgins and do not know whether he is for or against.  He reminds me of the man looking for a job as a groom, who pretended he knew everything about the saddling of horses; but when the owner went out one day he found the saddle put on the wrong way; he reprimanded the groom saying: &ldquo;You said you knew all about horses.&rdquo;  The groom asked: &ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo;&ldquo;The saddle is on the wrong way,&rdquo; said the owner; and thereupon the groom said: &ldquo;How the devil did I know the direction you were travelling?&rdquo; I do not know in which direction Deputy O'Higgins is travelling. Like Deputy MacBride, he has taken advantage of this sound investment to <Col N="1662" /> attack the Government for matters beyond their control.  Deputy MacBride has been very critical and has tried to justify his News Agency Bill&mdash;an adventure and a gamble&mdash;here to-night. I wonder if he agrees with members of the Labour Party who attacked the Irish Horsebreeders' Association.  I wonder if that is the way to abolish Partition, that those of that class prepared to help the Irish horse-breeding industry must be attacked in this House.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that Tulyar cannot respond to all the criticism&mdash;he is a dumb animal&mdash;but I hope he uses his hind legs effectively on some of the people who pretend to know something about the Irish horse-breeding industry. Deputy O'Higgins talked about horses in blinkers.  They are run in blinkers for a certain reason and if certain Deputies were running I am sure they would be in blinkers, too, for the very same reason.  The onus was put on Deputy Dunne.  The political Leader of the Labour Party has not said anything about it, but I would like to know Deputy Norton's attitude. Does he desire that the horse-breeding industry should fail?  Would he go down to Kildare and tell them that? He would not, but it is all right for him to say it here.</P>

      <P>There are people who make money out of industry or land or business and we are constantly criticising them.  Why?  Because they fail to put back some of the money; and that is bad for the land and for industry and for business.  You must put back, year after year, a certain amount of money, or failure is bound to result.  The National Stud Company decided in their wisdom that, having been a very successful venture up to now, they would put more money into it, to ensure that the Irish horse would get his rightful place amongst the horses of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told investments of this kind are eating up money and giving no employment.  Do the people who make those statements realise what the horse-breeding industry means in employment? <Col N="1663" /> There is no other industry giving so much employment and we are not going to kill it.  I congratulate the Minister on his steps to ensure that the prestige of the Irish horse will live. Please God, the progeny of Tulyar will be floating past the winning-posts with their tails in the air when the tails of the critics are between their legs, and will be for evermore.</P>

      <P>I believe everything that can be said about Tulyar has been said and that neither this nor any other Parliament ever spent so much time in debating the purchase of a single horse.  While the debate has centred around Tulyar, the Bill does not deal exclusively with Tulyar.  It is a measure to develop the bloodstock industry and I believe we are entitled to say whether or not this money could not be more gainfully employed in developing other industries.  I maintain that it could be and that there is no justification whatsoever at present for the expenditure of £250,000 on a horse. Deputy Blowick made it clear that it is a gamble, and the Minister's friend, Deputy Briscoe, reminded him of that fact, too.  Is this Parliament entitled to gamble with any portion of the people's money?</P>
      <P>When we read the provincial papers or meet our constituents, we learn the country is staggering under taxation and that people cannot bear the extra burdens.  The unemployed ask if any money will be made available to stimulate employment in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Dunne raised this matter here, he was told by the Government that there was no more money available.  No one said it was anti-national of the Government to turn down his suggestions, but now, when the Dáil is asked to vote £250,000 to purchase Tulyar, Deputies who have opposed this measure have been termed anti-national.  Why?  In my opinion, this measure is to subsidise the wealthiest class, those engaged in the bloodstock industry.  If the Minister wants to know who they are, let him read to-day's <i>Independent</i>, let him have a look at a few of the names under the photographs there.  I do not want to criticise any section of the <Col N="1664" /> community, but surely to heavens these people are not Irish in name or origin.  Why should we be asked to subsidise them?</P>

      <P>In view of the way the debate developed, I think I am entitled to mention it.  I claim that this Parliament has been asked to vote money to develop the bloodstock industry&mdash;leaving Tulyar out of it altogether&mdash;at a time when the country can ill afford it.  I was very much surprised to hear the views of my colleague from West Cork, Deputy Collins, on this subject.  On all occasions, he approaches the problems which come before the House in a very intelligent fashion, and I am surprised at his viewpoint on this measure.  He described it as one of the finest pieces of legislation the House was ever asked to enact.  What is fine about this pieces of legislation?  So far as the people whom Deputy Collins and I have the honour to represent, they do not care two hoots about this measure, and every one of them I have met has asked me to oppose it as strenuously and as vigorously as I possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not be better, so far as our constituents are concerned, and, I feel, so far as the Minister's constituents down in Kilkenny are concerned, if this £250,000, instead of going to the Aga Khan, went into the poultry industry which is now dying a very rapid death, due to the sharp decline in the price of poultry during the current year? Would it not be better to help the women and girls of the country who have to get a livelihood from that industry than to subsidise Brigadier the Baron de Roebuck and his comrades down in County Kildare?  I believe that Brigadier the Baron de Roebuck is very well able to look after himself and should be allowed to do so.  We owe nothing to such people. Such people as Brigadier the Baron de Roebuck and his colleagues, I feel sure, have the wherewithal to purchase Tulyar, if they thought fit to purchase him.  Why not let them purchase Tulyar, if he is such a bargain and if <Col N="1665" /> his progeny, as Deputy Davern prophesied, are going to pass all the posts in the country first with their tails in the air.</P>

      <P>I maintain that this money could be more gainfully employed in many other directions, and, as the measure has been introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, I have mentioned one direction in which I am very much interested, the development of the poultry industry. I believe it is quite relevant to this debate.  It could usefully be employed to develop agriculture under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I think it was Deputy Flanagan from Mayo who referred to that Act.  We have got nothing from it in West Cork and I believe that nothing has been got in any other part of the country, with the possible exception of North Mayo, which, on the eye of the general election, got something as a vote-catching stunt.</P>

      <P>I believe this is a piece of wanton expenditure and every word uttered by Deputy Dunne was quite correct, in spite of the criticism which has been levelled at him for what he has said.  This is a big gamble on a horse owned by the Aga Khan. Why did the Aga Khan himself, who is regarded as the wealthiest man in the world and who has an income of several million pounds&mdash;I believe the gentleman is weighed against gold every year &mdash;not take a gamble and hold on to him if Tulyar is the wonder horse we are led to believe he is?  I feel sure that he could have done so, but he is a man of some common sense, and, when he can get this Government, who have no money available for productive schemes, to give him the fine sum of £250,000 for a horse I believe he was very wise in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are as anxious to develop the bloodstock industry as any others, but we believe that the people who are in that industry are well able to look after themselves, much better able to look <Col N="1666" /> after themselves than the many thousands of small farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country who are living on uneconomic holdings and who could not get £250,000 for the development of these holdings from the Minister, no matter what pleas they made.  Some of these people and particularly those who supply milk to creameries&mdash;I made an agitation on their behalf before&mdash;had to go on strike to bring home to the Minister their economic plight and the seriousness of their position.  I made it very clear to the Minister in this House before that the dairy farmers, and particularly those in the uneconomic areas &mdash;I made a special plea to the Minister for them&mdash;could not exist in present conditions.</P>

      <P>I am relating it to the fact that the Bill provides for devoting £250,000 to the development of the bloodstock industry and pointing out directions, as I am entitled to do, in which the money could be more gainfully employed.  The Minister knows the position of the small farmers very well himself, in view of the answer he gave to Deputy Hession with regard to the dairying industry a few days ago.  Could the 90,000 unemployed in this country not do with this £250,000?  Could it not be used to help a section of the unemployed by opening up some industry of one kind or another?  If it were made available to county councils for the improvement of roads which are badly in need of improvement, or to the committees of agriculture for the development of agriculture to help the small farmers, would it not be more gainfully employed than in passing it on to the Aga Khan for Tulyar?  Tulyar, however, is to be purchased, because, if we are to judge by the viewpoint expressed in the House, some of the Fine Gael Party are clapping the Minister on the back for his decision.  I do not know what they see in it. Probably both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have some personal interest in this National Stud business.  We have <Col N="1667" /> been criticised very much, and probably rightly so, because we do not understand all about the bloodstock industry like the people who have criticised us.  We are not in a position to own racehorses, and the people we represent are not in a position to attend Punchestown, the Curragh or any of the other big racing centres. We have to confine ourselves to attending flapper events down in Drimoleague and such places.  I do not know whether Deputy Collins was ever at one of these meetings or not.</P>

      <P>We are not in a position to become acquainted with Brigadier the Baron de Roebeck or to have interviews, as Deputy Briscoe told us he had, with some leading racehorse owner.  I agree that we are not in a position to express the views they could express and we have not got that technical knowledge of the industry that they have, but we have sufficient knowledge and intelligence to say that it is completely and entirely out of place for a Fianna Fáil Minister, backed up by a section of the Fine Gael Party, to bring before the House a measure asking the Irish taxpayers, who, on the Government's own admission, are already overburdened, to pay £250,000 for Tulyar.  I say it is a gamble and I support the viewpoint expressed in this House that it is a gamble.  Are we, in existing circumstances, entitled to take a gamble?  We all hope that Tulyar will prove a sound investment and that Deputy Davern's prophecies will come true.  As much as any other Deputy in this House, I hope that Tulyar will prove a success because I should like to see the Irish taxpayers get some return for their money.  It cannot be denied that the expenditure of this large sum of money is a very definite risk.  We should like to hear, when the Minister is replying, what the incidental expenses are expected to be.  After the initial expenditure of £250,000 on the purchase of the animal, must insurance policies then be taken out in respect of it and <Col N="1668" /> is there any company which will accept such policies and, if so, at what figure?</P>
      <P>With few exceptions, everyone throughout the length and breath of the country is stunned at the figure paid for this horse.  We have heard about his racing capabilities.  We were told all about the races he won in Britain and about the strong opposition which he met.  All that is quite true.  Definitely he is an outstanding animal.  Why is it, therefore, that the English bloodstock people, with all the wealth at their command and with all the knowledge which they have, did not purchase this animal?  None of them came along and offered anything like the sum of £250,000.  Think of the Newmarket racing people and other big racing establishments including those of Her Majesty.</P>
      <P>I am sure many people in Britain are interested in the racing industry. Not one of them offered £250,000 to buy the Aga Khan's horse, but the Irish taxpayers' money&mdash;which, incidentally, is used to subsidise the National Stud&mdash;was used for the purchase of this animal.  In the light of these circumstances we can only assume&mdash;not being knowledgable so far as the value of racehorses is concerned&mdash;that Tulyar's price was inflated. Some Deputy said earlier in this debate that the supposed bid by an American syndicate was bogus and for the purpose of making our representatives pay an outrageous price.</P>
      <P>No matter what way we look at this measure, I regret to say that we cannot speak very well of it.  I have already said that I hope the animal will prove a success but, even if he does prove a success, who will benefit? It will not be the people whom I represent and the majority of the people in Kilkenny, whom the Minister for Agriculture represents, will not benefit very much either.  It is Lord this and Sir that who will benefit&mdash;people who have the monopoly of the bloodstock business in this country.  The ordinary farmer will not benefit.  The unfortunate man who has to line up daily at the labour exchange in Dublin City and elsewhere will not benefit even if the horse turns out to be a wonder horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> At a time when the people are so oppressed as a result of impositions by the present Government, I regard it as outrageous that this extra expenditure of £250,000 should now be foisted upon them.  I maintain that the Labour Party's approach to this matter is the correct approach.  The Government have no mandate whatever from the Irish people to pay that amount of the taxpayers' money for this horse.  If the matter were put to a referendum I believe that not one person in ten would support the Government's Contention that this is a wise move.  Consequently, this House should signify its disapproval in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little knowledge of racing and I do not attend race meetings but I must make my views known on this matter lest it be put to a division.  Deputy Murphy mentioned that this money is being devoted to the improvement of blood-stock&mdash;and the purchase of Tulyar is incidental to that.  The first question that strikes me is whether or not we are going to have a bloodstock industry in this country.  If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; then, as far as I am concerned, the bloodstock industry must be supported. One of the few things for which we are known outside this country is our bloodstock.  Although we spend considerable sums of money annually on Embassies, Ambassadors and representatives abroad, for the purpose of keeping up appearances, I believe that that money is not half as well spent as the money involved in the purchase of an ambassador like Tulyar&mdash;provided, of course, the animal in question proves successful in the functions for which he has been purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies I could paint a very gloomy picture of the situation with regard to unemployment and emigration.  I could enumerate hundreds of different propositions&mdash;all good&mdash;on which this particular sum of money could be expended.  If I decided, like Deputy Murphy, to suggest that this money should be diverted to, say, the improvement of the poultry industry then I am sure that that suggestion would be criticised by people <Col N="1670" /> in other areas who would say that they believe the money should be devoted to, say, the tomato industry.  There is room for a difference of opinion on matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>To my mind, we should not lose sight of the main objective, which is the improvement of the bloodstock industry, in our anxiety to get a well-deserved crack at a certain type of individual in this country: I refer to the people we see in fast and luxurious motor cars, with their rugs and field-glasses who attend every race meeting in the country.  I could feel prejudiced enough to vote against this measure if I allowed my judgment to be swayed by my dislike of this particular type of parasite that has invaded this country.  However, the improvement of our bloodstock is much more important than those people.</P>
    <P>In our attitude to this measure we are more or less inclined to drive a wedge between the Irish people and to suggest that the poor man does not enjoy a flutter at the races.  I discussed the purchase of this animal with several of my constituents.</P>
    <P>The general opinion was: &ldquo;Well, if we are going to purchase bloodstock, to purchase stallions, why not purchase the best?&rdquo; I am in agreement with that point of view.  We had, of course, Deputy Blowick, representing the Farmers' Party, speaking on this.  He had a canter on Tulyar in this House. I suggest that if the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ever find out the manner in which this horse has been treated by Deputy Blowick he will be subjected to very severe penalties.  When the Bill is passed, the Minister should, I think, ensure that there is one jockey, at any rate, that Tulyar will not have, and that is Deputy Blowick.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make this point clear.  The suggestion has been made that there were various offers made for this animal.  I understand that a syndicate in America or, as a matter of fact, that two syndicates offered larger sums than the sum for which the horse was sold to this country.  I should like to know from the Minister if that is true.  I have been told, however, that the owner of <Col N="1671" /> the horse did not accept the higher price because he felt that Ireland was entitled to first preference in regard to the purchase of this animal.  I am anxious to know if that is true.</P>
    <P>The chance of making a good purchase such as this does not present itself every day of the week.  I certainly would agree with a motion of this nature if, say, animals like Tulyar were available every year.  In that event I would be prepared to suggest to the Minister that &ldquo;in this particular year we are not in a position to pay out this amount of money and we should defer making the purchase until next year or the year after when we will have the opportunity of purchasing an equally good animal.&rdquo;  My opinion is that it is only once in a lifetime that an opportunity such as this presents itself.  According to the descriptions we have got, this particular animal is the king of horses.  It may be another generation or another 50 years before his equal comes on the market again, I therefore suggest to some of those people who have criticised the purchase that they should remember that an animal such as Tulyar is not available every year, and that consequently it is only very seldom indeed when this House is asked to pass a measure such as this.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am not a racing man.  I do not bet and, as a matter of fact, I have no interest in racing, but I do think that if we are going to build up bloodstock here, and are to go in for the export of thoroughbreds, that we should aim at producing real thoroughbreds.  Here is a criticism that I would like to offer to the Minister as regards our bloodstock.  In my opinion, one of the greatest methods of publicity available to us for the sale of our bloodstock was in the ceremonial parades that, at one time, used to take place in this city on the occasion of the President making visits to particular functions.  On those occasions, the President was provided to particular functions.  On those occasions, the President was provided with an escort of Irish-breed horses. To my mind, these were first-class animals and their display was a means of selling that type of animal to foreigners.  They presented a most <Col N="1672" /> impressive appearance, so much so that foreigners were inclined to purchase animals of that class.  Now, unfortunately, we have done away with these ceremonial parades and, instead, have introduced backfiring motorcycles, which are purchased outside the country and which are a nuisance and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Now that I am giving my support to this measure, I should like if the Minister would have a chat with his colleagues with a view to seeing whether these ceremonial parades with horses could not be restored.  They continued up to the time of the war. I think that if my suggestion were adopted by the Government it would help not only to improve our live stock, but, what is equally important, the sales of first-class horses.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I have to say.  An opportunity such as this occurs very seldom and, therefore, I think we should be slow to let it slip from us.  It is an opportunity which I think we should take advantage of, and that we should agree to the purchase of this animal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this measure. First of all, I propose to speak against it and, secondly, to vote against the proposal to devote £250,000 to the purchase of Tulyar.  Since I became a member of the House, and even before that, I listened to Ministers and Deputies going around the country making scare-mongering speeches: telling the people that this country was doomed and facing national bankruptcy. Now we have a proposal before us to vote £250,000 for the purchase of Tulyar.  In view of that, the people, I am sure, will form the opinion that what those gentlemen were saying at that time was absolutely untrue, and that there was no foundation for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is sheer madness at the present time to vote £250,000 of the Irish taxpayers' money for a purpose of this kind, particularly when we consider that so many of our Irish boys and girls are forced to emigrate to England and America to earn sufficient to maintain the homes of their parents in Ireland.  That is particularly true of my constituency in <Col N="1673" /> North Mayo.  Day in and day out, year in and year out, thousands of our boys and girls are forced to emigrate to earn a livelihood abroad.  I am sure that when, in their places of employment across the water, they read that this National Parliament of Dáil Éireann, assembled in Dublin, has voted £250,000 of the Irish taxpayers' money&mdash;not forgetting that some of it was, in the first instance, sent by those children to their parents at home&mdash;for the purchase of Tulyar, they certainly will be shocked.</P>
    <P>I am opposing this Bill, because I think we should first of all consider the sons and daughters, the grandsons and the granddaughters of the children who fought with Davitt in the Land League movement.  We should consider them in preference to people who were our enemies, openly declared enemies of ours and of the Irish cause, down through the years.</P>
    <P>As I see it, it is these people we are catering for now, and that this Fianna Fáil Government has been catering for ever since its foundation.  It is doing it again to-day.  The people who engage in racing in this country and who own the ranches here, were never, as I say, friends of this country. Coming as I do from a poor mountainy area and representing, as I have the privilege and honour to represent as one Deputy, that historic place named Stráide where Michael Davitt with his Land Leaguers stood bravely and boldly against those people, I think it is a disgrace and a scandal that we here, assembled in the National Parliament, should put racehorse owners and racehorse breeders before our own flesh and blood, before our own brothers and sisters who have been forced to emigrate due to the fact, in many cases, that the holdings on which they were reared are uneconomic and that, for many reasons they cannot get employment at home.  It is certainly strange that there are gentlemen who were elected to this House who will support such a measure.  I am sure that the generations of Irishmen who gave their lives never visualised such a situation, never visualised that Dáil Éireann would assemble for this purpose.  The <Col N="1674" /> blood of Irishmen flowed freely that we might have a Parliament of our own and that we might consider our own people first.  Here we have, as Deputy Michael Pat Murphy of Skibbereen said, a Government who are prepared to vote £250,000 of the taxpayers' money for this purpose while on the other side of the picture there is reluctance on the part of the Government to drain rivers, to reclaim land, to provide the ordinary farmer with a suitable by-road or a suitable road leading to his farm or farm buildings.  It is a disgrace that such a situation should exist.</P>
    <P>A short time ago I listened to the Taoiseach in this House saying if the British should shelter under a certain umbrella when the shower of rain comes does that mean that we should not shelter under the same umbrella? The particular umbrella that we seem to be sheltering under now is the bookie's big umbrella.  I cannot say for certain whether there will be room for the Aga Khan, Mr. Winston Churchill, our Taoiseach and others under that umbrella, but I am sure that many of the Irish people will have to keep away from it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Murphy said, the ordinary country people cannot afford to go to Punchestown and other big race meetings throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It is obvious that it is not the ordinary people that this Government are worrying about when they bring in a measure of this kind and ask Dáil Éireann to vote £250,000 of the taxpayers' money for such a purpose.</P>
    <P>I am not narrow-minded.  If I thought we had reached the stage that the country was so prosperous as to be in a position to afford such a gamble I would be quite prepared to gamble also but, as things are, while Irish people are forced through economic stress to leave the country in order to earn a livelihood, I regard this measure as ill-timed and of no benefit to the ordinary people.  It is a benefit to the wealthy, to the bookies and to others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins, as a member of the Fine Gael Party, said he supports this measure.  I began to question why it <Col N="1675" /> was that Deputy Collins should decide suddenly to vote for this measure.  I am open to correction, but I have been told some time or other in this House that Deputy Collins had some connection with the Racing Board of this country or some racing interest.  I am open to correction but, if that is so, if he has some personal interest in this Racing Board or these racing bodies, perhaps it is natural that he would vote with the Government on this occasion.  With respect to Deputy Collins, I submit that his duty is not to racing boards.  He represents the same constituency as Deputy Murphy represents, and I am sure it is the same type of people he represents.  We know from song and story that the people of historic Skibbereen and other places in that constituency stood by things Irish in times gone by. It is rather surprising that a man of the name of Collins should on this occasion put racing interests before the interests of his constituents.  However, I suppose that is Deputy Collins's own business, but I feel I am entitled to refer to it.</P>
    <P>During last week I was approached by people in my constituency who are interested in procuring bulls for the improvement of the live-stock industry. They were anxious to procure a bull through the Department or through the local committee of agriculture. Having made inquiries I was told that there was a scarcity of bulls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir.  I know the question of bulls does not arise but I submit that it would be far better for the Government to invest more money in improvement of the live-stock or cattle-breeding industry than to invest it in racehorses, particularly at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have experts on milk yields in the Dáil and we hear them saying that milk yields should be improved.  Would we not be better employed in fostering the dairying industry and improving milk yields than in fostering something which, as admitted by the Party opposite, is a complete gamble? <Col N="1676" /> As the leader of our Party, Deputy Blowick said, while we do not wish this industry any harm or ill-luck&mdash;far from it&mdash;we have no guarantee that this horse may not meet with an accident or that it may not die.  In that event, the money spent on this undertaking will be lost.  There may be certain protection in the matter of insurance of a limited kind.</P>
    <P>I submit that the whole principle is entirely wrong at this juncture.  It is in keeping with Fianna Fáil policy in the past 17 or 18 years of catering for the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  It is a policy that has forced Irish boys and girls to emigrate.  Racehorses, aeroplanes and extravagant schemes that are really of no benefit to the ordinary plain people have been financed.  We see the result in wholesale unemployment.  Unemployment figures have increased very substantially and I am sure the people who sign on at the labour exchanges in Ballina, Swinford, or any of the towns in my constituency will derive little comfort from the fact that Dáil Éireann is voting £250,000 of the people's money to buy this racehorse that may die overnight.</P>
    <P>Having spoken against this Bill, I intend to vote against it.</P>

A suggestion was made by a member of the Labour Party, and repeated by Deputy O'Hara, that these people had some financial interest or other in this particular investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will get the quotation when it appears in the Official Report and Deputy Dunne can read it. It is not good enough that suggestions of that kind should be made.  As I said, it is only right that we should examine this matter objectively, as I think Deputy Dillon did examine it objectively.  He put the case in a nutshell when he said that if we are to have a national stud we ought to set ourselves out to purchase the best bloodstock available and, if we are not prepared to do that, the best thing to do is to scrap the National Stud.  I think the House will accept that that is the position.</P>
      <P>Attempts have been made to suggest that this expenditure of £250,000 is in the nature of current expenditure out of taxation.  In actual fact, it is a capital investment.  We have heard a lot during the last two years about the necessity for a capital investment programme. We have heard criticism of the Government for not investing more money in projects designed to increase the wealth of the nation, to increase our export trade, and to help to make the country more prosperous.  Now when there is a proposal to make an investment of this kind we hear rather stupid criticism of this as current expenditure from taxation and that the money should be spent on increasing unemployment assistance or on some matter of that kind.  I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to consider projects of this kind seriously.  If we consider them seriously, we will find that every conceivable project which may be put up in the nature of a capital investment is in the nature of a gamble.  Last week we had a proposal to dieselise the railway services, to invest in diesel engines.  There, again, you have a project which appears on the face of it to be sound, but which may involve <Col N="1678" /> risks.  In the same way, if it were proposed to invest £250,000 in a meat factory for the export of meat to the United States, Canada, or elsewhere, there again you would be taking a considerable risk and involving yourself in a considerable gamble.  There is no conceivable industry designed to provide employment that does not involve the risk of loss.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the type of mentality which refuses to embark upon any enterprise and which would keep this nation poor and to a great extent dependent upon outside help. The spirit of enterprise is still very much alive amongst our people and there are people who are prepared to adventure forth and to seek to improve, not only the cattle trade, but the horse-breeding industry and every other branch of national enterprise.  Since we took upon ourselves the task or, if you like, the liability of establishing the National Stud to improve our bloodstock, it is only right and proper that we should carry that project to its logical conclusion and ensure that it is adequately financed to discharge the function for which it was established. It is true to say that if we breed the best type of horses that industry will grow and will provide very considerable employment.  Many Deputies have talked here about the necessity for providing employment for our people, and it is only by entering upon a project of this kind and seeing how far it can be utilised for the benefit of our people and by taking risks, if necessary, that we can make any progress.  The type of mentality which cries out against every conceivable enterprise, whether it is a factory or anything else, must inevitably pull our nation down and keep us poor.</P>
    <P>There was a great depth of ignorance in regard to the ordinary life of our people displayed in Deputy O'Hara's speech when he said that the plain people of Ireland cannot afford to attend Punchestown Races.  The Deputy must never have been near Punchestown, because if he were he would find a large proportion of the population of Leinster travelling by horse and cart, by bicycle, and every other type of vehicle to attend that race meeting where admission is <Col N="1679" /> absolutely free and every section of the people can come together for a day's enjoyment.  We ought not to allow narrow parochial or narrow class prejudice to influence our minds in the consideration of a matter of this kind. We ought to consider, as I admit Deputy Dillon did, the risks on one side and the advantages on the other side and, if we decide that the advantages to the nation as a whole outweigh the risks, we ought to support this project and support it in an honest and honourable way instead of trying to stir up class feeling and class prejudice or parochial feeling and parochial prejudice unworthy of our people.</P>

      <P>The Government is proposing to gamble £250,000 of the taxpayers' money.  That is a good gamble, and it may be successful, but I am one who will never stand for gambles.  If the nation is heading towards bankruptcy we should face up to that situation and cut our cloth according to our measure.  A few days ago the Minister for Finance told us that the Government could not implement the increase proposed for civil servants. He told us the Government could not afford to pay the civil servants, the teachers and the Civic Guards.  Yet, the Minister for Agriculture can come in now and afford a sum of £250,000 on a gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the State should interfere at all in this.  This horse should have been purchased by the wealthy individuals who have money to burn.  Evidently they did not think it worth their while to risk their <Col N="1680" /> money and so the poor old Paddy must be forced to risk his.  I know the horse is a good horse.  There is big money in him and he can make big money.  But money is not everything.  The soul of the nation is more important.  The country is suffering at the moment from a surfeit of gambling and speculating and it is time that some curb was put upon it.  There are people in the country with money to burn.  The soul of the nation is in their grip and they are weaning our people away from the ideals for which we fought and suffered in the past.  It is time a halt was called.</P>
    <P>The horse industry is a good industry, but I believe in first things first.  All over the Midlands in the past there were small, thrifty, well-conducted stud farms run on sound national lines and giving a good return and good employment.  Most of these to-day have been sold out.  They have been bought by foreign speculators lashing money around north, south, east and west.  The little man has been bought out and the foreigner is there in his place with his foreign outlook and his foreign ways.  Something must be done to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>All round us there is national decay. We have emigration and unemployment. The language is dying.  Our Irish traditions and our Irish culture have gone by the board.  Everyone is looking in the direction of Punchestown and the Curragh where the big money is and the ordinary, sturdy men who had their roots deep in the soil are being squeezed out and have to fend for themselves in foreign lands.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to take stock. There should be a review of the whole National Stud.  I do not think the right people are getting service from that stud.  The ordinary man breeding the ordinary type of good horse cannot get his nose inside the National Stud.  I do not think the stud deserves a penny of the Irish taxpayers' or ratepayers' money.  I think a review is badly needed.  I could mention the names of some of the foreigners who have come in here to squeeze out our own people. Some of the names are the length of <Col N="1681" /> my arm.  Their interests are contrary to Irish racing.</P>
    <P>People talk about the horse-breeding industry and all the money it is bringing in.  What good is money if the nation loses its soul?  Money is not everything.  The foreign monopolist is not coming in with his money bags to give more employment.  He is coming in to destroy the nation.  20 or 30 years ago we would not have allowed them to do that.  To-day, because of their tenacity and their grip, we are allowing them to call the tune and we are dancing like a lot of fools.  The Minister should withdraw this Bill and carry out a review of the National Stud.  Then we can see where we stand and we can let horse breeding and racing take their normal place in the country's life and not allow them to be monopolised by foreigners.  It is time we made some effort to build up the country in a truly national way.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation.  I understand that in my absence Deputy O'Hara alleged that I had some connection with the Racing Board.  I want it put on record that I have no connection good, bad or indifferent with the Racing Board or with any other racing organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is interesting because of the expressions of opinion we have had from Deputies, In the ordinary way the time of this House should not be used for a debate of this particular kind.  The National Stud has been established by statute. It operates under statute.  So far it has operated successfully.  The Bill before the House proposes to increase the capital of that organisation.  Once the principle of the National Stud is accepted, as it has been accepted, a Bill brought in for the purpose of increasing its capital should not take very much time.  The National Stud has operated successfully under successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has now decided to buy the finest racehorse in the world and whoever took the decision to purchase that animal should receive the congratulations of both the House and the nation.  Too often we are critical of national organisations and other organisations which will not take a <Col N="1682" /> forward step when the opportunity arises.  The National Stud in this particular instance has taken a very big decision.  It was a big decision in the interests of our bloodstock industry and one that should be welcomed rather than criticised in the way it has been criticised in this House.  It is a business organisation which has been operating with reasonable success.  It is endeavouring to improve our bloodstock so that our reputation as a nation that produces and breeds the finest racehorses in the world should be enhanced.  Why we should have this debate extending over many hours I cannot understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it unreasonable to suggest that if the Deputy thinks there should be no debate, that he should not continue the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the debate.  I am talking about the criticism.  Many farmers in this country make a good living and employ quite a number of men in connection with the bloodstock industry.  It ought to be the desire of every person in the country to support anything that makes for the improvement of that industry, for the maintenance of employment in it and, if possible, for the increase of employment in it.</P>
      <P>We had the usual type of criticism that it is unwise to spend £250,000 in this way.  That is the approach of some Deputies.  Deputy Giles said: &ldquo;On another occasion I would support a motion to spend £250,000 on the purchase of a horse like Tulyar.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is the approach that has been made.  It was a question of either purchasing this horse or losing the opportunity of purchasing it.  I think it was a wise decision to take, and it is wrong to say that we might have deferred it until things were better.  Deputy <Col N="1683" /> MacBride suggested&mdash;I will come back to Deputy Dillon.  I am not surprised that Deputy Dillon laughs, because he certainly was laughing up his sleeve while Deputy MacBride was speaking. He was smiling profoundly.  Deputy MacBride made this suggestion to the Minister.  &ldquo;I will offer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to support this Bill if the Minister will give £250,000 to purchase a number of bulls.&rdquo;  No wonder Deputy Dillon laughed up his sleeve, knowing the efforts that were made by Deputy Dillon, by the present Minister and, in fact, by every Minister for Agriculture we have had since the State was established, to spend all the money that was necessary in getting the finest bulls that were procurable.  Deputy MacBride wants us to spend not only £250,000 on Tulyar but to spend another £250,000 on bulls, and bulls and bulls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfortunately the typical approach we have to a problem such as this.  &ldquo;It is unwise to spend it this way.  You should spend it in some other way,&rdquo; and that coming from a Deputy who is very anxious that the Government should encourage any projects of a capital nature to repatriate the sterling that is locked up in London or elsewhere. Here is our opportunity of repatriating £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, repatriating £250,000.  Here is an opportunity of spending £250,000 in a capital project and Deputy MacBride says: &ldquo;No, spend it on bulls.&rdquo;  He says, of course: &ldquo;Would it not be better to give the £250,000 to the civil servants.&rdquo;  He says it would be a far better way of spending the money than spending it on the purchase of a racehorse.  This money is not ordinary revenue.  This is a capital project and the moneys that are being put into this project are capital moneys.  There is a very big difference between capital moneys and ordinary revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the very same thing last <Col N="1684" /> week.  Deputy Lynch brought in a project here for bog development in North Mayo and to start a grass-meal industry.  Again we had the same attitude of mind.  Deputy MacBride says: &ldquo;I think it is unwise to spend it that way.  Why not grow strawberries in Mayo?&rdquo;  Bulls!  Strawberries!  That is to be our approach to every suggestion of capital development in the country.  I am quite sure there will be some laughter in the Chancellories of the world when they read of Deputy MacBride's contribution to this debate which, I hope, the Irish News Agency will send abroad&mdash;this record of Deputy MacBride's fall, such a shocking fall, when he is forced to associate with Deputy O'Leary and to depend on Deputy O'Leary's defence in his opposition to a capital project such as this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne has adopted his usual tactics in regard to this matter.  I think that everything we can do to improve the country should be done.  On that aspect, Deputy Dillon has spoken this evening <Col N="1686" /> with restraint, knowing, of course, the particular difficulties which he was in. Deputy Collins has also spoken.  Both of these Deputies certainly adopted the line that anything that could be good for the country should be done. I should imagine that when Deputy Dunne has an opportunity to consider this matter in a big way, he will realise that his opposition to this measure is unwise.  It is hardly in accordance with the principles of a Party who want to create opportunities for improving the country, opportunities for capital development, for employment and national development. It is the easiest thing in the world to say: &ldquo;Why not spend £250,000 on the unemployed?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason at all why we should have any unemployed? The reason we have unemployed is because we have not expended enough capital moneys in the right way.  When we want to expend capital moneys on anything, we have the Deputy Dunnes and other Deputies coming along and saying: &ldquo;You must not spend money in that way; give it to the unemployed.&rdquo;  That is what I term the cross-roads approach to our problems.  Anyone who reads or studies the philosophy of the Labour Party will never find that type of philosophy in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the approach of Deputy Dunne and his colleagues to this measure.  It is a type of propaganda, indulged in particularly by people representing city or urban areas, which I can well understand.  It is a very easy matter to suggest to city or urban dwellers that this is a very large sum to spend on the purchase of a stallion, and when it is said that the money should be put to other and better uses in which these people would be interested I can understand that type of approach.</P>
      <P>I must say that I cannot understand the approach of the Clann na Talmhan Party to this measure.  I fail for the life of me to understand why the Clann na Talmhan Party, who boast and claim to be representative of agriculture and of the farming community as a whole, should attack a measure of this kind that purports to be for the betterment of agriculture and that of live-stock breeding in this country, whether it be horses, cattle, sheep or pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that, in the West, we have not any racing establishments, but we have a number of industrious farmers who produce hunters from time to time.  Our farming community are interested in horses and are interested to a very small extent in racing just as the people, as a whole, are interested in racing.  I, therefore, fail to understand the approach of Deputy Blowick and his colleagues to this measure.  When Deputy Blowick and his colleagues take this attitude towards this measure, I am sure that other Deputies representing city areas will question these Deputies the next time that they make <Col N="1689" /> claims for agriculture in this House and the next time they make claims on the Exchequer for the purpose of getting money to improve any other branch of agriculture and particularly of horse-breeding in this country.</P>
    <P>Tulyar has got a very good canter through this House.  I was amazed to hear at the end of his run Deputy O'Hara trying to wrap the green flag round him.  I do not think that approach will gain any kudos anywhere, because this House, a number of years ago, decided the principle of the matter we are discussing to-night. This House, in its wisdom, decided to set up the National Stud Board for this particular purpose, to improve horse-breeding in this country.</P>
    <P>I think the members of that board are to be congratulated and should be congratulated upon being able to secure this horse notwithstanding some of the suggestions and reflections that have been made on the former owner.</P>
    <P>If what we are told is true I also think that this country got a special chance of purchasing this horse from the Aga Khan.  I think that the thanks of the Minister and of the House should go to the Aga Khan.  We all know from what we read that the Aga Khan is an extremely wealthy man.  I have no doubt nor do I think that anybody believes that he was solely and entirely influenced in selling this horse to this country by a mere question of filthy lucre.  We are also aware that some very close relations are more interested in the United States of America than they are in this country.  We believe that the National Stud Board in this country were specially favoured in getting the opportunity of securing this horse for this country.</P>
    <P>I believe the people who spoke here and expressed the view that this is a good investment.  I believe that with some luck&mdash;and there must be some luck in connection with matters of this kind at all times&mdash; this purchase may turn out to be an excellent investment. The main point I want to emphasise is that the principle of this matter has long ago been decided in this House. It was a question that this board, when an opportunity arose, should take their courage in their hands and endeavour <Col N="1690" /> to secure the best horse in the world to stand in the Irish stud.</P>
    <P>Some people say that the export of horses is not very big.  It is true that our reputation as far as horses and horse breeding abroad are concerned stands second to none.  It is true that this country in its wisdom sends our Army jumping team throughout the world mainly as an advertisement for the horse industry in this country and the export of horses.  But if our horse-breeding industry and horse-export industry are not as large as they might be at least we should, as a matter of policy, concentrate on having them the best there are.  There is an old saying in the country to the effect that if a farmer had only a goat he should be up in the middle of the fair with it. Although our horse-breeding industry may be comparatively small compared with that of America what we have is good.  If we are going to maintain that tradition and reputation in world markets, I think for that reason alone the purchase of this animal, if he is lucky, is undoubtedly justified and that time will prove that the purchase of this animal is justified.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider it, is there any reason why, having regard to the importance of this industry, this money should not be spent in this way, especially when we consider the millions of pounds that we have expended since 1925 under the Live-stock Breeding Act, 1925, on the cattle-breeding industry?  You had the mentality&mdash;it is still there&mdash;of the people who told you that the scrub bull was quite all right and good enough for the people.  We all know, notwithstanding the difference of opinion in connection with the cattle-breeding industry, that we have made tremendous strides since 1925 in that connection.  There is just as much reason, as a capital investment and a sound one, to endeavour to hit the top as far as horse breeding is concerned, as there is in connection with the cattle industry.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who is concerned with the farming community and the agricultural industry as a whole realises in his heart that a good job has been done in securing the services of Tulyar for this country.  He realises that the <Col N="1691" /> intention of the board in purchasing the animal was that in the long-term view they hoped to still further enhance the reputation of Irish horses throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying that I can understand, from a propaganda point of view, the approach of the Labour Party to this question, but I certainly cannot understand the approach of the Clann na Talmhan Deputies in this connection.  Horse breeding, let it be more or less what it is in my constituency, represents a vital part of the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>It seems that so far as the horse-breeding industry of this country is concerned the Minister for Agriculture, supported by many people in this House, wants to make us world-beaters.  We have suddenly developed that frame of mind where we consider that the horse-breeding industry in this country should be the best in the world.  I do not think that anybody on these benches would object to an ambition of that type.</P>
      <P>Many speakers, including the last one, described the speech of Deputy Dunne and the attitude of the Labour Party as being a low form of political propaganda in view of the situation that exists in the country at the present time.  One would think that Tulyar was a golden horse.  Emphasis was placed on the desire of the people of this country, and especially of horse-breeders, to keep Tulyar at home.  I do not think it would be a low form of debate, and I do not think there would be anything unnatural in saying that it would be far better to keep the people at home.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to bring about a much-needed amendment and reform of our civil law.  Far too little time has been devoted in our discussions here to bringing about amendment of the law which deals with the ordinary everyday life of the people.  We spend a great deal of time in passing Bills which do not affect in the slightest many of the real problems which face the people.  It is for that reason that we, on these benches, have introduced this Bill to bring about in one particular a much-needed reform of the law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is styled the Civil Liability Bill and, as its title would indicate, it is intended to deal with the common law affecting liability for wrongs done between one citizen and another.  I do not think it is necessary to weary the House by a discussion on our common law with regard to civil wrongs.  Suffice to say that all Deputies will appreciate that if one citizen is careless and negligent in the way he conducts himself and, as a result, causes harm and injury to another citizen, he commits a civil wrong or tort entitling the person injured to sue him and recover such monetary compensation as a court may decide to give him.  That is a very simple right which the law gives to all citizens and a sanction which it imposes against a wrong-doing of a civil kind.</P>
      <P>If a person does something wrong, short of a crime, injures another person, that person is entitled to sue him and get compensation.  Needless to say, it is that rule which ensures that each one of us in our everyday life tries to be careful and tries to have due regard to the ordinary rights of others, knowing that otherwise we might find ourselves sued and damages for injury recovered against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That rule of common law is as old <Col N="1693" /> as the law itself, but after it was first recognised a rule grew up to the effect that if the injured party, the person who suffered the wrong, the person who was hurt, had been a little bit careless and if his carelessness contributed to the injury he suffered, then he was not entitled to sue anyone.  If two people were driving&mdash;it may have been chariots in those days&mdash;and both were going a little carelessly, one more so than the other and one was seriously injured, neither could sue the other because the fault of each one had contributed to the injury.  It was in that way that this defence of &ldquo;contributory negligence&rdquo; grew up.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on Deputies the real harm and hardship that has been done and that is being done by this rule of the ordinary common law.  Right throughout the years it defeated the claims of a person who was seriously and gravely injured as a result of an accident to which he had contributed in some very slight degree.  That person for all time lost any right to get any compensation from anyone.</P>
    <P>On account of the real hardship of the rule of contributory negligence, which prevented an injured person from suing, our courts here and in England tried to get out of the effect of that rule.  They created a new rule of law which was called &ldquo;the rule of the last or final opportunity&rdquo;.  It arose in this way, that if two motorcars were being driven up to a corner, say one of them being driven too fast and the other on its incorrect side of the road, and they collided at or around the corner, and if before the collision took place the person who was sued later had an opportunity of avoiding the negligence of the person who was suing, then the person suing would be entitled to recover.</P>
    <P>It was and is an artificial method, whereby the courts have endeavoured for some time past to defeat the hardship of the defence of contributory negligence.  Unfortunately, even that way out is being closed now.  To-day the tendency has been more and more to get away from what is called &ldquo;the third question&rdquo; and to leave to a jury only two questions&mdash;was the defendant <Col N="1694" /> negligent, and was the plaintiff negligent? If the answers to both questions are in the affirmative, the action fails.  Every day in the courts seriously injured persons are being deprived of all compensation.  For that reason, we on these benches have suggested that some step to reform the law should be taken.</P>
    <P>The proposal contained in this Bill is not a novel one, it is nothing very new or startling or strange.  It is a proposal that has been tried in relation to collisions between ships at sea, over a great number of years.  It is a proposal entitling a court investigating an accident or a collision to say that, by the amount that the person injured was at fault, but by no more, that person's damages will be reduced. If the person was equally at fault with the person sued, instead of getting the full amount, say, £100, which a judge might decide his injuries entitle him to, he will get only £50.  That is what is called the Admiralty rule in relation to contributory negligence.  It has been in operation, as I say, in relation to collisions at sea for a great number of years and is, in that connection, part of our existing statute law, being incorporated in the Maritime Conventions Act of 1911; but in any event, it is already recognised by one branch of our law, a branch of the law which does not often arise and is not frequently discussed in the courts.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that that particular rule has never been applied to the ordinary accident that occurs every day in circumstances in which people seriously injured are unable to get any redress.  It was this very hardship in relation to the rule of contributory negligence that caused members of the British House of Commons some years ago to get down to discuss and to see in what way the common law, which then in England was the same as it is now in Ireland, could be modified to give some relief and some redress.  I think it is a tribute to that law reform committee of the British House of Commons under the chairmanship of the present Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell-Fyffe, that, even in the middle of the turmoil and destruction of the last war, they nevertheless found time <Col N="1695" /> to consider the common law as it affected and applied to ordinary British subjects.</P>
    <P>That law reform committee was responsible for the introduction of a great number of very worthwhile law reform statutes.  I will refer to only one of them which was passed in 1945. It was entitled &ldquo;an Act to amend the law relating to contributory negligence and for purposes connected therewith.&rdquo;  That Act, styled as the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act, 1945, a British statute, introduced into the law of civil liability in England, into road accident cases and ordinary negligence actions, the Admiralty rule with regard to damage and contributory negligence.</P>
    <P>I know that, since that Act was passed in Britain in 1945, a very great social wrong has been remedied.  To-day the person who walks along a British road or footpath, possibly without keeping his eyes open and having due regard to everything that is taking place, who might be a little careless and who is severely injured by a negligent, drunken or careless motorist, knows that he can go to a court of law, that he can sue that motorist for damages, that he can say to a judge or jury: &ldquo;I know that I was not as careful as I should have been&mdash;I was a little to blame myself &mdash;but that does not disentitle me to relief,&rdquo; and can get, under the Law Reform Act of 1945, a judge or a jury to assess what damages his injuries entitle him to, be it £1,000 or whatever other sum it may be.  He can then get the judge or jury to consider whether or not he himself was at fault and, if so, whether he was 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 25 or 50 per cent. at fault and by the amount to which he was at fault the damages the jury have already found will be reduced.</P>
    <P>That statute rule in England is fair both to the person sued and to the person injured, because the person sued knows that the unfortunate person who is injured, who loses an arm or a leg, has been punished by that loss in respect of whatever fault he may have been responsible for and the person who is injured gets from <Col N="1696" /> the wrongdoer some contribution for the injury he has suffered.  This Bill proposes to introduce, with certain differences which are necessary, the same rule as now exists in Britain under the British Act of 1945.  The material section is Section 2 which provides&mdash;I think I should read the first paragraph, because it sets out what is proposed to be done:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own negligence and partly of the negligence of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the negligence of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This epitomises the purpose of the Bill, to visit as a punishment for contributory negligence, not the entire defeat of the claim, but the reduction in the damages that may be recovered. Section 2 of the Bill proposes to do that.</P>
    <P>There is also in sub-section (2) of the section a consequential provision in relation to negligence causing death. In Britain, by another of the law reform statutes, the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, provision was made whereby in respect of action brought arising out of carelessness which caused death, actions brought by the dependents of a deceased person, the fault or carelessness of the deceased person does not defeat a claim, but again, there is a reduction in the amount of damages.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides that where the action is in respect of the death of a person, the damages to be recovered by the dependents shall be reduced by the degree to which the deceased person was at fault, if the court finds that he was at fault.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 it is necessary to provide for consequential provisions in relation to the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934.  As the House is no doubt aware, under the Workmen's <Col N="1697" /> Compensation Act, 1934, a workman who is injured in the course of his employment has alternative remedies, in the first instance, open to him.  He may proceed under the Act against his employer or he may proceed at common law to sue for damages.  The Workmen's Compensation Act provides that if his claim for damages is dismissed&mdash;possibly on the ground that, voluntarily, he undertook the risk or that partly he was at fault himself&mdash; the same court is entitled to award him the compensation under the Act&mdash; subject, of course, to the costs of the action.  When drafting this Bill, I had in mind the possibility that a workman who sued at common law under his right under the Workmen's Compensation Act and who ordinarily might be entitled, say, to £300 or £400 damages but who was, perhaps, 75 per cent. at fault and accordingly found his damages reduced to £100, might like to say: &ldquo;I will not take those damages.  I prefer now to go back to what I would have had under the Workmen's Compensation Act.&rdquo;  Provision is made under Section 3 whereby he is entitled to do that if the damages he is likely to recover or has recovered in the common law action are not high enough.</P>
    <P>That would apply, in particular, to fatal cases.  If a workman is killed in the course of his employment his widow and family together are entitled to £600 compensation.  The dependents of the workman who is killed may still have a right to bring an action under the Fatal Accidents Act.  By reason of the abolition, as proposed in this Bill, of the defence of contributory negligence and the reduction of the damages in such an action they might find that they were getting, say, £500 from a court whereas they would be entitled to £600 under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  In those circumstances, the Bill entitles them to say that they would prefer to retain their rights under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that nothing in the Bill will interfere with or concern the present rule in relation to Admiralty cases&mdash;to collisions at sea.  That is already dealt with under the Maritime <Col N="1698" /> Offences Act, 1911.  It also provided under Section 4 that the Act will not apply to any acts or omissions before the passing of the Bill into law.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 5 to bring about a slight amendment of the Tortfeasors Act, 1951.  As the House is aware, the Tortfeasors Act, 1951, introduces the right of two people who were injury to another to halve contributions between them as to the damages they might have to pay to the injured party.  That right of contribution and apportionment of damages is set out in Section 4 of the Tortfeasors Act of 1951. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of that Act provides that no apportionment shall be made in any case under sub-section (1) unless the judge is satisfied that all persons liable as tortfeasors in respect of the injury are before the court.  In practice, that particular sub-section has meant that the entire section has not been workable. The House will appreciate the position that would arise if, for example, there was a collision in this city between a C.I.E. omnibus and an ordinary motor vehicle, which might be driven by a chauffeur or some employee of the owner, and if a person travelling in the bus was injured and sued C.I.E. and the owner of the car that collided with the bus.  Both of these vehicles would have been driven by employees of the owners.  The C.I.E. bus would have been driven by a bus-driver and the motor car by some person other than the owner.</P>
    <P>Nobody in his senses would bother about suing the two drivers but the two drivers are tortfeasors: they, in fact, brought about the injury.  Under the Tortfeasors Act the court could not apportion in those circumstances unless all the persons liable as tortfeasors were before the court.  In effect, that has meant that no apportionment has been possible.  Section 5 of this Bill proposes to remedy that situation by providing that the court can, in those circumstances, apportion if it thinks fit or, if it prefers, may adjourn the question of apportionment.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that certain opposition may be expressed to this Bill.  Insurance companies may possibly, suggest <Col N="1699" /> that this Bill will put them out of business.  There will be that type of opposition but, in fact, there is nothing in it.  Undoubtedly, more decrees will be given and more actions will be fought.  More persons will recover compensation but the amounts of compensation will in many cases be far less.  To-day where a person is injured in circumstances which might suggest a sharing of the fault, and the injuries are serious, it often means that the injured person is entitled to £10,000 or nothing.  There is no in-between. The insurance company or the defendant face an award from a jury of £10,000 or, if they are lucky, they get away with nothing.  Under this Bill it might mean in those circumstances that an award would be given but it would be substantially less.  There may be more awards but I have no doubt that even the indemnifying companies will find that the decrees given will in the long run be far less.</P>
    <P>It is always a good thing, in proposing a matter of this kind, to be able to point to experience elsewhere.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the law courts in the Six Counties and in Britain will appreciate that the Contributory Negligence Act of 1945 has worked extremely well and has brought about a very beneficial result to this branch of the law.  I have no doubt that the same result is desirable here and it can be achieved only by a method of law reform of this kind.</P>

      <P>Earlier to-day we had a suggestion, which very properly came from the Opposition Benches that in the matter of bringing in amendments to existing Acts, some attempt should be made to bring all Acts into line so as, without perhaps going as far as codification, to tidy up legislation.  If this Bill has any defect it is that it would have the effect of creating untidiness in legislation if it were put through.  I am not suggesting for a moment that any of the amendments sought in the existing state of the law by the proposals in the Bill are not desirable.  I do suggest seriously, however, that somehow the main provisions <Col N="1700" /> in the Bill do not seem to hang together.</P>
      <P>There are four main provisions in the Bill.  The first deals with the apportionment of damages to a person who is plantiff in an action in a case where the plantiff himself may be negligent. As a result of that negligence, he would, under the existing law, be precluded from getting damages.  Deputy O'Higgins has rightly pointed out that defect in our law, that, in respect of giving damages to a person who may be partially guilty of negligence in an action against a person guilty of negligence to a greater degree the damages which that person should get should, he suggests, be reduced to some extent rather than have him put out of court altogether.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that there were four main provisions in the Bill, and I commented on the fact that Deputy O'Higgins had rightly <Col N="1701" /> focussed attention on the defect in our law to which I have referred.  The second point that Deputy O'Higgins made was in connection with the workmen's compensation code.  He said that if a person bringing an application finds that the damages he gets or is likely to get in a common law action is so much, he may have recourse to the workmen's compensation remedy. He may ask the court to award him, instead of common law damages, relief under the Workmen's Compensation Act&mdash;that is if he thinks that it may be greater than his relief at common law.  He applies the same remedy to the dependents of a workman who may have been killed as the result of an accident in the course of his work.</P>
      <P>The third major feature of the Bill is an amendment of the Tortfeasors Act of 1951 to which I propose to refer later.  I am suggesting that here you have three different pieces of legislation thrown into one amending Bill, and that these would be far better dealt with within their own legislative sphere.  I am suggesting, too, that this Bill would make the law, as we have it in our Statute Book, rather more unwieldy than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first major feature of the Bill is that Section 2 tends to apportion blame as between the plaintiff and the defendant in a common law action.  I notice that such an amendment was brought into the British Statute Law. It followed the report of this law revision committee to which I have already referred.  I see that they had on that committee members with such well-known legal names as the Right Hon. Sir D. Maxwell-Fyffe, the Right Hon. Lord Justice Romer, the Right Hon. Lord Justice Porter, the Right Hon. Lord Justice Goddard, and I presume other well-known members of the Senior Bar in England whose names are not familiar to me. It is obvious, judging by the calibre of the British Law Revision Committee, that this amendment, before it was introduced into the British statute law, must have received very careful consideration from the different interests concerned.  You had, obviously, members of the bench whose opinions were consulted as well as members of <Col N="1702" /> both branches of the legal profession. I do not know to what extent judges and members of both branches of the legal profession here have been consulted, or at least have reported.  I think this is a matter on which their opinions should be got.  I am not suggesting for a moment that Deputy O'Higgins is not in a position to summarise for us what their opinions might be.  I do suggest, however, that if we had the benefit of these opinions from the Minister, and subsequently the benefit of the Government's examination of them, we might perhaps get a more comprehensive Bill in so far as that aspect of it is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion for the inclusion of the workmen's compensation provision, the Deputy is aware that the Minister for Social Welfare has promised to bring in, in the very near future, a comprehensive revision of the workmen's compensation code I suggest that here is a provision which might be considered by the Minister for Social Welfare in bringing in his series of amendments.  Personally, while I agree to some extent with the suggestion contained in Section 3, I am not at the same time satisfied that Deputy O'Higgins has properly and fully dealt with the subject.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is right that the person who brings an application at common law, on finding that the amount of damages he may get at common law might be somewhat less or considerably less than he would get under the Workmen's Compensation Act, should be given the option of going for a remedy which will provide more damages.  Generally speaking, I think it is a good idea that a person who has a right of action should get as much damages as the law can provide for him but I think it would require a great deal of consideration as to whether or not he might be allowed to proceed under what I consider a rather haphazard provision in an amendment to the workmen's compensation code in a Bill entitled the Civil Liability Bill, 1952.</P>
    <P>Coming to the other major provisions, the amendment of the Tortfeasors Act, 1951, I did happen to read, to refresh my memory, Section 4 of <Col N="1703" /> the Tortfeasors Act, 1951, and I can see that there is an obvious case for remedying there; that it is quite possible, whether advisedly or by accident, a plaintiff may omit to name a person as a defendant to a suit who, the evidence discloses, should obviously have been named as a defendant and, therefore, if there is to be any apportionment of damages as between defendants, it is only right that all the defendants should be named and should be available to the Court or to the jury whose function it is to apportion damages between them.</P>
    <P>The thing that occurs to me immediately in regard to the amendment here is, at what time does the Deputy consider that the missing party, the absent defendant, should be brought in as a party to the suit?  If all the evidence has been heard against possibly only one or two named defendants and the court decides that perhaps there is another party, the driver of another car, perhaps, or another pedestrian, who, the evidence discloses, has had some responsibility for a particular accident, at what stage could he be brought in and be made liable in damages to a plantiff?  I suggest to Deputy O'Higgins that it would be unfair that a third party, or a fourth party, even, should be brought in at a stage when all the evidence has been heard and he is being brought in only for the purpose of having damages assessed to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. He should be given the same opportunity of defending himself as any of the other two or three named defendants. I suggest that here is an obvious case where more consideration should be given to the amendment.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that the amendment is necessary but I suggest that, in order to tie up this amendment properly, more consideration should be given as to the point of time that the other defendant should be brought in in order to be saddled with a portion of the damages to which the court may have already decided the plaintiff was entitled.  At what stage does the Deputy suggest it should be done under this particular amendment?  As far as <Col N="1704" /> I can see it, the court can bring in this other defendant at a stage when the court is about to assess damages and at a stage when that other defendant may not be given an opportunity of putting in evidence in relief of his own obligation and liability.  I suggest to the Deputy that the possibility of a defendant finding himself at a grave disadvantage arises under the provision as it is at present drafted and, therefore, that it requires further consideration.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I think Deputy O'Higgins is to be commended for bringing these matters before the House.  I do not see that there is any case against the principle of two of the amendments, that is, the amendment contained in Section 2 and that contained in Section 5.  The workmen's compensation provision, I think, requires much more detailed examination than appears to have been given by Deputy O'Higgins and I think also that perhaps Section 2 requires far more detailed examination.  From the very drafting of it, there is no doubt that Section 5, that is, the amendment of the Tortfeasors Act, requires considerably more examination than appears to have been given.</P>
    <P>I do not know what attitude the Minister will take but I believe that the Government have not had an opportunity of considering this Bill and all the implications of it.</P>

I have pointed out instances where it requires much more examination than it appears to have got.  There are obvious defects to be remedied and there are obvious defects in the measure itself that require more detailed examination.</P>

      <P>The first thing that strikes me about this Bill and another Bill in the name of Deputy Dillon, that is, the Fatal Accidents (Amendment) Bill and also the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Bill, is that they are the sort of measures that ought to have been considered by a law reform committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  I was coming to that.  When we were leaving office before, we were just on the point of appointing a law reform committee. The whole idea was to get the advice of judges and the two branches of the legal profession as to what reform of the law was necessary.  I know that Deputy O'Higgins was interested. I asked a few questions while in opposition as to what had become of that. It took me a long time to get through all the preliminary work of setting up that committee.  The ex-Ministers will know the difficulties about staffing arrangements.  We had gone through all that when the change of Government came about and it was let drop. I think it was a great pity.  I do not want to put any blame.  If we had that committee, there would not be the same necessity as there is now for me to take the attitude that I am going to take on this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident from the two speeches that have been made that it is a complicated measure and that the Act passed in England was passed only after it had received great consideration by a law reform committee there. The Parliamentary Secretary has given some of the names and it is quite clear that it was only as a result of investigation by that body that the British Parliament passed that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that circumstances here are <Col N="1706" /> the same as they are in England but I do not think they are quite the same. It would not be proper, I believe, for us to rush into legislation without having had the advice and views of these bodies.  I know that at least one of the legal bodies has expressed a wish to give their views on this Bill already.  I have a letter here.  They certainly have views and would like to get an opportunity of expressing them. That is the first thing.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that I should bring the matter before the Government without being fortified by the opinions of these bodies.  I think that is a fair position. Therefore I cannot advise the House to pass the Second Reading of the Bill, although I am not opposed to the principle of it, until we have had the benefit of the advice of these bodies We will have to ask them separately, whereas if we had this law reform committee working a lot of measures of this kind I am sure would have been put on the Statute Book.  They would have been properly considered and brought before the House.  We would have had the advice of these people and come to our own decisions, having full regard to the advice given to us. I also think that it would be better if the three Acts were not included in this Bill for amendment.  It would be better to amend the Tortfeasors Act by itself rather than to amend it by this Bill.  I have not brought this matter before the Government and naturally I cannot commit the Government to any legislation which they have not bad an opportunity of considering.  I do not see any chance of having that considered for some time.  I would not be prepared to bring the matter before the Government until I had it properly examined.</P>
    <P>There is also the non-legal aspect of it, how it might affect insurance companies and others.  I do not know to what extent it will affect them.  I should like to have the views of all these interests before bringing the matter before the Government, although I am not suggesting that what is proposed in the Bill is not desirable. I suggest that the Deputy should do what Deputy Dillon did in the case of the Public Bodies (Protection) Bill <Col N="1707" /> which he brought in, namely, not to proceed with the Second Reading now but allow it to stand on the Order Paper and in due course I will try to get the views of the judges and the legal bodies concerned.  That is the position in which I am at present. Even if I were in full agreement with the Bill, I am sure it will be admitted that it would not be proper for me to try to commit the Government without giving them an opportunity of considering it.  Even if it were not necessary to consult these other bodies, I do not see much chance for some time of bringing it before the Government because the Government programme is very full and I could not get proper consideration of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the view of the Opposition is.  I will make another effort and ask the Government to set up a law reform committee again.  But there is not much good in doing that if, after a short time or a long time, whichever it may be, it is to be thrown over because this Government set it up.  It would be a pity if that were done.  It was done before.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that that is the case.  I raised it when the Tortfeasors Bill was brought in here by Deputy Costello when he was in opposition before.  The principle of it was accepted.  We brought it to a special committee and I know that we put it back until this law reform committee would have an opportunity of considering it.  As I say, it took time to do that.  By the time we had everything ready, the Government went out of office.</P>

He was to come in and help but he found he had not the time to do it.  That took a lot of time.  I told him I was not prepared to bring in the Bill until we got the law reform committee to express its views on it.  There were several other Bills of the same kind.  That was the cause of the delay.  I do not say that in any carping spirit.  I will try to get the Government to set up the law reform committee, and if we succeed this time I hope it will be left to them.</P>

      <P>This Bill introduced by Deputy O'Higgins has many things to commend it.  The first thing to commend it is the fact that it has been brought in at all.  The second is that Deputy O'Higgins made a very reasonable case in regard to it.  He has set out the law as it is in operation and made his suggestions for improvement. I personally do not think that it is any great defect in the Bill that it seeks to amend a number of Acts.  I do not think it is necessary that we should have what Deputy Lynch referred to as &ldquo;this tidying up.&rdquo;  I am not at all in agreement with the idea that we must have matters such as this considered by a law reform committee, because the peculiar thing about a committee of judges such as the Minister has in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  A committee on which there will be judges will do anything except reform the law.  They are quite satisfied that the law is all right, and they can make a great case for leaving the law as it is.  It is an extraordinary fact that this State, 30 years ago, was a great Republican State, that we were very anxious to bring about reforms of all <Col N="1709" /> kinds when we got the opportunity, and yet we have lagged disgracefully behind the British Parliament, which has brought in all kinds of law reforms. The law of property was reformed out of all recognition a quarter of a century ago while we have done nothing about it.  The setting up of a law reform committee consisting in the main of judges will, in my view, prevent any reform at all.  It is extraordinary how conservative we are and how we dislike any change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We fear all sorts of changes.  We had a perfect example of that recently when the Defence Bill was before the House.  There is a section in it dealing with the inspector-general. Nobody could give any reason why that section should be there.  The Minister could not justify it.  He said: &ldquo;I cannot give any reason why it should be there, but leave it there.&rdquo; That is the tradition in relation to law, leave things as they are.</P>
      <P>The Tortfeasors Bill of 1951 has been mentioned.  I understand that Bill was recommended to the House by a form of committee set up either under the chairmanship or with the authority of the Attorney-General at the time.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out to-day, it had within it a most obvious defect.  The fact that the Bill came before the House recommended by a committee may mean that Deputies did not examine it as closely as they should have examined it.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a law reform committee I think it ought to be a committee of Deputies and of ordinary people who can very often see that, as they say, the law is an ass and should be changed.  People who are operating within the law and in the routine of the law are inclined to think that everything in the garden is lovely and things should be allowed to continue as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a number of good things in this Bill.  There ought to be no trouble about the main part of the Bill which has been in operation in England since 1945.  There are defects <Col N="1710" /> in regard to the Tortfeasors Bill and the Workmen's Compensation Act. There could be differences of opinion as to the proper machinery and as to whether the two people left out should be covered.  In connection with the Workmen's Compensation Act there is scope for considerable disagreement. But the main aspect of the Bill should present no difficulty and the other matters to which I have referred could be disposed of simply enough.  Similar provisions have been operating successfully in England and in the North of Ireland for the last eight years and we should have no difficulty in accepting that part of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>We will never get anywhere if we insist on a law reform committee consisting of judges, representatives of the Bar and representatives of the solicitors' profession.  The odd thing is that the people who would represent these bodies on such committee might not represent the views of the majority of the members of the organisation to which they belong.  That is one of our difficulties.  Where we have an opportunity of making an amendment in the law, as we have here, that should be considered by a committee of this House.  We have had some experience of such committees.  Such committees have been under a certain amount of examination and criticism recently. Such a committee is a good thing provided the members attend the meetings and play their part.  If they do not do that the value of the committee is considerably lessened.</P>
    <P>If the House were to accept the major principles in this Bill and the major part of it, then the matter could be considered by a special committee. If that committee were of the opinion that the workmen's compensation amendment should come in the Workmen's Compensation Act by a special Bill and that the provision for amending the Tortfeasors Bill would be better in a special Bill of its own, these particular sections could be removed. A law reform committee is nothing more than putting matters on a very long finger.  It is a peculiarity about law that expedition is not a feature of it.  Perhaps we do not need too much expedition but there should be some reasonable degree of expedition. <Col N="1711" /> I think it is a reflection that we who call ourselves republican should lag so far behind the nation with which we were hitherto associated and which we look upon as imperialist and conservative. That nation is miles ahead of us in relation to law reform.  In Britain to-day they are succeeding to a great extent in making the machinery of justice what it ought to be from the point of view of giving fair play as between man and man.  We are not even trotting behind them.  We are staggering behind them.  Apparently we have no desire to progress.</P>
    <P>I would not commit myself to the machinery in certain sections of the present Bill, but I agree with the main principle of the Bill, and I would rather see it go before a Special Committee of this House rather than condemn it to the limbo of a law reform committee.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some Deputies are tired, but even if a Deputy is tired there is no reason why he should be bad-mannered, deliberately yawning when another Deputy is speaking.  I am not responsible for the bad manners of Deputy Dillon, but I think it is the grossest discourtesy for a Deputy to be deliberately yawning when another member is speaking.  It is not only when I am speaking that we have these offensive, ill-mannered yawns.  It also happens when other Deputies are speaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say briefly that I am in favour of the legislation proposed in this Bill.  It is long overdue. Every side of the House recognises the need for legislation of this nature.  The Minister mentioned that it was intended that a law reform committee should deal with this Bill. There was, of course, other legislation to be dealt with by the law reform committee besides this Tortfeasors Bill.  If we look back over the last two years we will see that, without the law reform committee, several laws have been reformed.  That, I think, is a good argument to offset the excuse that the law reform committee should have been set up in order to deal with this particular legislation.</P>
      <P>The real value of this proposed legislation would be that it would make the existing laws more flexible.  The laws which it proposes to amend are in many cases more than 100 years in existence.  They were framed at that time probably in very different circumstances and although they have applied in a general way to the needs of the present day, amendments are needed. That is why a Bill of this nature deserves to be made law as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would like to see some amendments of the legislation carried out soon instead of putting them on the long finger.  Legislation like this in a general way is being operated in Great Britain also.  Of course, the Tortfeasors Act in Great Britain applies to a number of different Acts but applies also to a number of Acts which this Bill is designed to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that our present system of compensation is often directed by the jury system and juries are faced with <Col N="1713" /> the need either of making a positive or negative decision.  They cannot make a decision which would go some of the way in both directions so far as liability is concerned, the degree of liability and the degree of contributory negligence.  This Bill is designed to guide juries in assessing scales of compensation.  We have often seen ourselves that the amount of damages awarded by juries appeared to be fantastic.  They have no option but to award these damages when they are not left the discretion of applying the principle of contributory negligence and reducing the scale of damages accordingly.  I have nothing further to add except in regard to the Workmen's Compensation Act and even that amendment in this Bill appears to be reasonable.  I believe even if the Workmen's Compensation Act were to be amended at a later date, as was mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary earlier to-night, it could be amended in order to fit the new circumstances.  In the interests of all the people concerned and particularly those who at the present time are forced to pay very high damages when in fact there is a question of contributory negligence existing, I feel that in fairness to them legislation that would bring in that measure of moderation should be brought in as soon as possible.  It would be fairer to everybody concerned. It would be fairer to those who have to pay the compensation and it would be fairer to those who receive it.</P>

      <P>The maddening thing about this kind of discussion is the further it goes on the more hopelessly everybody seems to get into a mess. Where are we now?  What is going to happen?  The only thing we are certain of is that nothing is going to happen.  That is what is so utterly maddening about any attempt on the part of a Deputy in this House to undertake the work of amending the statute law for the purpose of bringing it into line with what is generally admitted to be the desired form.  Everybody says: &ldquo;Yes, we agree in principle with this Bill, but you cannot do this; you cannot do that and you cannot do the other thing.&rdquo;  If the Minister would say: &ldquo;I will come back to <Col N="1714" /> the House within a month and tell the House that the Government proposes to send this Bill to a Special Committee of the House&rdquo;; &ldquo;that the Government proposes to send this Bill to the Attorney-General&rdquo;; or &ldquo;that the Government proposes to ask the House to reject the Bill&rdquo; you might know where you were, and you would feel your attempts were not being dissipated. It is maddening to feel yourself being sucked into the bog&mdash;with which I am so familiar&mdash;of bureaucratic frustration in which everybody is static; when that stage is reached we move on to the next business and everyone hopes and prays that no more will be heard of this disturbing matter. What makes me frantic with impatience is when I hear a fraudulent person like Deputy Cowan mumbling and bumbling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let him disprove it if he can.  He has been sitting in Government Buildings, but what has he been doing?  He had power to revive that committee if he wanted to.  He could have revived this committee within a week of coming back, but he preferred to have this glorious alibi for doing nothing.  If he had set up that committee the personnel of which he had, the secretariat of which he had, and the approval of the Minister for Finance for which he had, all this legislation which has been submitted to him could have been referred to that committee and these matters could have been under consideration for the last 18 months, but he preferred to have this very good alibi, and in effect he says to the House: &ldquo;I would like to have a further and better opinion on this Bill. If there was a committee in being I would refer it to them.  I did not bother bringing it before the Government as I think I first ought to get advice which I am not in a position to get at the moment.&rdquo;  The net result is that we are just back where we started.  Is it not time that we determined that matters of that sort should be dealt with within a reasonable time? Such matters could have been dealt with by the Attorney-General in his Department.  That policy may not have pleased the present Minister but that was our policy and we operated <Col N="1716" /> that policy.  The Minister had a diametrically opposite policy&mdash;to set up a law reform committee.  Where is it?  We have waited practically for two years to bring this into operation.  Are we to wait another two years?  If the Minister meant business in regard to the proposals that were made to him &mdash;they were made to him with the desire, let me say, to help&mdash;he would have taken some measures to have them examined on their merits, and not ramble in here merely to indicate that he is not able to say &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; or that he is not yet in a position to ask the Government what they think about these Bills.  We have given ample evidence of our desire to be of assistance and of our desire not to press the Minister unduly, when the matters we submitted for consideration required longer and better consideration. Remember this is the second or third Bill submitted.</P>

Does the Minister think that a courteous or civil attitude?  These are matters which should normally be attended to by the Government but the Government's programme is already overloaded.  What is the purpose of Private Deputies' time except to make it possible to do this type of business outside an already overloaded Government programme?  When Deputies forgo their opportunity to take abstract motions in Private Deputies' time, in order to bring forward legislative proposals which may be implemented outside the Government programme, would you not imagine that the Minister would show some kind of appreciation for our efforts to fit in to Private Members' time business which more properly might be brought within the time available for Government business?  Would the Minister tell the House with some degree of precision what is going to happen about this Bill?  Will he move for its rejection, will he send it to a committee <i>ad hoc</i> of this House, a committee <i>ad hoc</i> of legal officers, will he send it to the Attorney-General or <Col N="1717" /> will he undertake to name a date on which he will be able to tell the House what he intends to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that there are certain people whom I should like to consult before I agree to accept this Bill.  After I have done that, I shall put the measure to the Government.  I also said that I was favourable to the measure myself but I am not in a position to commit the Government to this proposed legislation until the Government has an opportunity of considering it.  The programme at the moment is somewhat overloaded, therefore I cannot name the exact day or month on which I shall be able to announce the Government decision.  I can say that in respect to the other Bill, the Local Authorities Bill, I am in a position to send a memorandum and I hope that there will be no undue delay in doing the same with this Bill. I have got however, to ascertain the opinions of various people whom I mentioned and perhaps of the insurance companies and others affected. Then when I have a proper view of what the repercussions of this measure may be, I shall bring it to the Government. I have no intention of delaying.</P>

      <P>This is the month of <Col N="1718" /> February and I take it that before the summer recess, though not necessarily then, the Minister will be in a position to inform the House definitely of the course to be taken in this matter.  I cannot speak for Deputy O'Higgins but so far as I am concerned that would be fair enough.  The Minister knows that he will be in a much stronger position if he can say to the Government secretariat: &ldquo;I have a time limit up to the adjournment of the Dáil for the Summer Recess within which I want to tell the House what we are doing with regard to this Bill.&rdquo;</P>

We have gone to some trouble in putting down this legislative proposal and from my point of view I should like to have some guarantee that, if the Second Reading is adjourned, the Bill is not going to be committed to the limbo of forgotten things.</P>

I should like if the House would agree to adjourn the Second Reading of the Bill to some time, say six months from now, so that it will in any event come back on the Order Paper and an opportunity will be given for a decision by the Minister.

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Fatal Accidents (Amendment) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="1720" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has certainly one quality to commend it. It is a very simple proposal.  Under the Fatal Accidents Act, the relatives of the deceased person who seek to sue the tortfeasor for the death of their relative, were allowed, under the Statute commonly known as Lord Campbell's Act, 12 months from the date of the fatal accident wherein to sue.  I think I am right in saying that if the deceased person had not been killed but had survived the accident he would himself have six years in which to sue the tortfeasor responsible for the accident in which he was injured.</P>
      <P>Under the common law, when the victim of the accident was dead his dependents had no right of action because it was held that the deceased person's right of action dies with him. It was to remedy that defect that the Fatal Accidents Act of 1846 was passed.  I am reliably informed that injustice has occasionally resulted from the limitation of one year which is now imposed on the dependents of the deceased person.  I understand that the infrequent cases in which dependents have lost their right of action and gone without the compensation which they would have recovered if they had started proceedings within the statutory 12 months have been due, usually, to some confusion which has resulted in time slipping by, not infrequently as a result of no lack of diligence on the part of the claimant but, perhaps, through an oversight on the part of his advisers or her advisers or their advisers, as the case might be. I understand that the likelihood of such an important event transpiring would be rendered almost non-existent if the period in which they might initiate proceedings was extended from one year to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot imagine that this represents any revolutionary amendment of the Statute law as to call for the appointment of a law reform committee to require examination by judges, senior counsel and others.  I am not nearly as much interested in what judges, lawyers, or anybody else thinks about <Col N="1721" /> it.  I submit this for the consideration of my rational fellow-citizens in this House.  Is it unreasonable to afford a widow-woman two years in which to get her action under way against tortfeasors responsible for the death of her husband, or should we, draconianlike, restrict her to one?  I cannot see anybody suffering any loss.  Ordinarily, bereaved people who have lost the wage earner will, by their circumstances, be driven at the earliest possible moment to appeal to the courts in order to get compensation for the loss they have endured, but a case does turn up from time to time in which, for the reasons to which I have referred, they do not manage to get started within the statutory 12 months and then they may be faced with a situation that the unfortunate widow, dependent child or persons of that kind, have lost their right of action altogether.</P>
    <P>One can argue that there is no reason to extend the period from one year to two years, that people are as likely to be caught by the two-year rule as by the one-year rule.  There is no argument in principle to counter such a claim but I am informed by those qualified so to speak that the extension would, in fact, remove every conceivable possibility of hardship arising.</P>
    <P>I have been urged to incorporate in the Bill that I bring forward certain other reforms regarding the Fatal Accidents code, notably one of bringing within the category of dependents classes of persons whom it would appear equitable to bring within that category and which have not been provided for in Lord Campbell's law. I have deliberately forborne from attempting that degree of reform because I feel that it would have left me open to the comment by the Minister for Justice that this was going rather far afield and that we ought to have the matter examined by a law reform committee in order to ascertain its implications.  I, therefore, resolved to keep my proposals within the narrowest possible limits so that, if possible, we could by-pass, swim under or fly over the customary mass of red tape which is employed in order to demonstrate that it is much better to do nothing at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> I cannot conceive of any rational being saying that there could be any serious injury done by giving the widows or orphans two years instead of one in which to seek their remedy in a court of law.  That is the full extent of my modest proposal set out in the Bill, and in the name of expedition and in the name of reviving the belief in the capacity of this Oireachtas to legislate according to its own discretion, I would suggest to the Minister that he accept this Bill and that we should be jointly a party to one of the greatest miracles since Moses struck the rock that we passed an Act of Parliament without permission of the Civil Service, the Treasury, the judiciary or any other vested interest, good, bad or indifferent, but simply and solely in the interests of Oireachtas Éireann and in the interests of nobody but the humbler citizens whom we all represent in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that in this connection I certainly cannot see eye to eye with the mover of this Bill as I did in connection with the suggested reform of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The House should realise that in cases of death in this or any other country to-day and where a wage earner has suffered his people lose no time at all in consulting their legal advisers. I cannot conceive how any hardship could arise under the law as it now stands.  I cannot conceive of a case where a wage earner or anybody is killed that the next-of-kin or the dependents, where there are dependents, do not forthwith consult their legal advisers.</P>
      <P>In cases of fatal accidents you have inquests at which the next-of-kin are represented.  In virtually all these cases at present, there are proceedings of one kind or another before the courts.  The circumstances are fully investigated either at the inquest or in the courts.  Wherever there is dependency, legal advice is taken forthwith.  I am not convinced by any of the reasons advanced by Deputy Dillon that the time should be extended from one to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the House to contemplate another aspect of the matter. If a threat of proceedings is hanging <Col N="1723" /> over the head of the proposed defendant like the sword of Damocles for two years, even though he may not be liable at all, it is another matter. There is 12 months to bring proceedings against him, but the House is being asked to extend that to two years. Such defendants have their worries just as much as the plaintiffs.  Again, where the defendant may be covered by insurance in a car accident, insurance companies have to budget from year to year and they want to know their liabilities, at least within a certain percentage, for the particular year under review.  From the point of view of the agony of mind of the proposed defendant and also from the business point of view, I see no good reason why the period should be extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is 12 months the period within which they must take action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In fatal accident cases they have 12 months at present during which they must bring the case.  My experience and that of any of my colleagues I have talked to is that no hardship is created by this limitation. I want to emphasise that by virtue of the very fact that a life has been lost, legal advice is taken and invariably there are proceedings of one kind or another, irrespective of the civil liability.  I cannot see the case where there would be hardship, or the type of case Deputy Dillon has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of Lord Campbell's Act the wife, husband, parent or child can bring an action but a brother could not do so.  I take it that is what the Deputy has in mind. Take the Workmen's Compensation Act, where there must be dependency within the regulations.  Even in the sad circumstances where someone is accidentally killed, I cannot see what case can be advanced, in commonsense or in law, for people making capital out of it where they never had dependency on the unfortunate individual who has lost his life.  We who are engaged in the practical side of the business know that an attempt is always made to foist that on the defendant, or to create a case for partial dependency, even where someone <Col N="1724" /> may never have been a dependent before.  Artificial ways and means are adopted at all times to try to inflate claims by claiming dependency where it never really existed.  The present law is that in the case of fatal accidents under Lord Campbell's Act the wife, husband, parent or child can recover, and I think that is quite adequate.  I certainly do not know of any hardship arising under it.  The present position is fair enough. Speaking individually at the moment, my reaction to the Deputy's proposals is, as they say in the country, that &ldquo;I am again them&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a case in mind in which I am inclined to agree with Deputy Dillon.  A man lost his life in the service of the State.  He had a widow and three young children. There was a solicitor engaged and she hoped to get redress rather than go to court.  When that effort failed and the time came when she wanted to go to court, she was told she was Statute barred.  Deputy MacCarthy probably understands the case I have in mind. I am at a loss to know what hardship would be created if the period were extended to two years.  In the case mentioned, I doubt if I could attribute blame to anyone but the widow herself. She consulted legal advisers and when she failed to get redress by persuasion, she found she was Statute barred.  I would not object to giving her a further period and I take it that is the type of case Deputy Dillon wants to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>It will help me in making up my mind, as I have not an intimate knowledge of the Campbell Act, if this point is made clear.  Does the time within which a person can proceed date from the actual death or from the date of the accident?  It would seem to me if it is from the time of the accident, and a person lingered on for 11 months or for 364 days, there would be only one day during which the dependent could claim.  If it is from the date of death it would not seem unreasonable to allow one year for proceedings to be <Col N="1725" /> taken.  If that point were cleared up, it would help me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not contradict the Minister, but I am told it is not. It is really to provide for the class of case Deputy Hickey has referred to that this is brought forward.  I do not see that it can do any harm and it may do a great deal of good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the same position with regard to this Bill.  It was introduced on the 12th of the month and I have not had an opportunity of presenting this Bill either to the Government.  There is, however, in the Department a draft consolidation Bill consolidating the Acts of 1846, 1864 and 1908 and I hope to present it to the Government at an early date.  In the meantime, I think we ought not to pass this Bill.  The Government has not had an opportunity of discussing it and if Deputy Dillon is expecting to see, as he says himself, the greatest miracle since Moses struck the rock, I am afraid I shall have to disappoint him.  It is only a fortnight since the Bill got its First Reading and, as I say, I have not had an opportunity of consulting the Government.  I cannot commit the Government to legislation, but I hope to have the draft Bill now in the Department, a Bill prepared in the previous Government's time to consolidate these three Acts, before the Government at a very early date. Whether that will satisfy Deputy Dillon or not, I do not know, but I am in exactly the same position with regard to it as I was in regard to the other Bill.  If Deputies bring in Bills every few weeks, I cannot be expected to accept them right off no matter how I may feel personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this motion could not possibly be reached to-night. I did not think that the Deputies who had the other motions on the Order Paper would think so little about them that they would refrain from moving them.  Therefore I must apologise for not having with me some <Col N="1735" /> facts which I should like to put before the House in support of the following motion which I now move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that a commission should be established to inquire into the methods by which rateable valuations are fixed and to make recommendations for the removal of anomalies and injustices and the reform of the system of poor law valuations and that, pending the report of the commission, no increase should be made in the valuation of buildings because of improvements or extensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not interested in any proposal for a reform of the system of poor law valuations.  I am very much interested in this problem. I always have been, because I have always felt that the system by which valuations are ascertained, and by <Col N="1736" /> which direct taxation, based on these valuations, is levied, is somewhat harsh and unjust.  I feel that it is particularly harsh and unjust on people who, in their desire to benefit the community generally, as well, perhaps, as benefiting themselves to a certain extent, proceed to improve property which comes into their possession.</P>
      <P>The position at the moment is that poor law valuations are fixed in accordance with a statute passed away back in 1850, over 100 years ago.  I am glad to see that Deputy O'Higgins has come back to show some interest in the problem of valuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I spoke too soon.  Perhaps he is not really interested.  It is an extraordinary thing that a fairly large political Party which boasts that it stands for the protection of private property, for initiative, for private enterprise and for the policy of encouraging citizens to improve their property and thereby give employment to their fellow citizens, has no interest in this particular proposal.</P>

      <P>Are we entitled to go on in the absence of the people who should be on those benches opposite?  There is no Clann na Talmhan or Clann na Poblachta Deputy in the House.  I think that the House is being treated with contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say, if Deputy Cogan gives way, that it is quite obvious that the Deputy and other people in the House are at a disadvantage in speaking on this very important motion.  The benches opposite are completely empty.  The whole Opposition is represented by two members of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be in order for me, Sir, to propose that, in these circumstances the House should now adjourn until 2 p.m. to-morrow?  That would enable Deputy Cogan to resume the debate on this motion on Friday at 12 o'clock. There will be Private Members' time <Col N="1737" /> on Friday.  It is quite obvious that Deputy Cogan's motion, which is a very important one, will not receive the consideration it deserves in the absence of practically the whole Opposition.</P>
