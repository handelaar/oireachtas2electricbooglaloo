      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state how the figure of £26,000,000 shown at Item 69 of Table A.7 in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey,</i> 1951-52, as representing direct taxation on persons in 1952 is arrived at, indicating the amounts under income-tax and other forms of direct taxation.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the note to Item 69 of Table A.7 of the <i>Irish Statistical Survey,</i> 1951-52, the figure of £26,000,000 shown in that item for direct taxation on persons in 1952 is a residual.  It is obtained by deducting the estimated payments of direct tax in 1952 on undistributed profits of domestic, public and private companies, and on the profits of external companies arising from their activities within the State from the total of £37,000,000 shown in Item 57 of Table A.6 for the direct tax receipts of public authorities in the financial year 1952-53.  It must be emphasised that the allocation of direct tax between persons and companies for 1952 cannot be considered as more than conjectural.  As also indicated in the survey, total direct taxation includes income-tax, surtax, corporation profits tax, estate etc. duties, stamp duties (exclusive of fee stamps), receipts from wireless licences and that portion of motor vehicle tax paid by private motorists, together with both employers' and employees' contributions <Col N="1652" /> to social insurance.  In view of the conjectural character of the allocation, it is not possible to indicate the amounts under each of the different headings which constitute the £26,000,000 total direct taxation on persons The only items known at this stage are approximately as follows: Surtax and supertax, £2,000,000; estate, etc., duties, £2,500,000; wireless licences, £250,000; motor vehicle duties, £1,500,000; and contributions to social insurance, £4,500,000.</P>

      <P>The estimated figure for the profits before tax of public and private companies from their operations within the State, whether such companies are incorporated in the State or abroad, was £34,000,000 in 1952.  The estimate of the undistributed profits after tax of all companies incorporated in the State was £13,000,000 in 1952.</P>
      <P>Due to the inevitable delays involved before data for the satisfactory estimation of such figures become available, the estimates given for 1952 cannot, as stated in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey,</i> 1951-52 (Pr. 1983), be considered as more than conjectural. In the use of such statistics, all the relevant definitions given in the survey should be borne in mind as, for example, the fact that in deriving the figure quoted for profits the allowances made for depreciation are the wear and tear and obsolescence allowance for income-tax purposes.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, tariffs and import restrictions apply to individual commodities and not to particular concerns. Without a detailed examination of the exact type of commodity produced by each establishment, it is not possible to state the total number of industrial concerns producing transportable goods which engage in the production of any commodities which are protected by tariffs or import restrictions.  To determine the number of such concerns would be an exceedingly onerous task for which the information available from the Census of Industrial Production would be completely inadequate.  Even if the requisite detailed particulars were available, in view of the multiplicity of commodities produced by many concerns in single establishments and of the fact that some of these commodities may be subject to import tariffs and restrictions and some of them may not, I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by aggregating the value of the output of concerns which produce any commodities of the nature specified since the total value of such output would be far greater than that of the protected commodities.</P>

The resources of the company are expected to be sufficient to meet payments falling due up to the middle of 1955, and it would be premature <Col N="1655" /> at this stage to set a figure on the amount of the additional Government investment which may be necessary.</P>

      <P>In calculating the average annual rainfall in this country it is considered necessary, having regard to fluctuations from year to year, to take an appreciable period of years to obtain a fairly stable figure. A period of 35 years has been adopted in this country.  The figure for the period 1916 to 1950 is at present being calculated and indications are that it will be about 43.2 in.</P>

    <P>Income-tax statistics are not, however, compiled in such a manner as to enable that precise information to be given but it is estimated that the <Col N="1656" /> number of individuals with total incomes not exceeding £182 per annum who were effectively liable to income-tax for 1939-40 was in the neighbourhood of 20,000 and that the number with total incomes not exceeding £390 who were effectively liable for 1952-53 was approximately 105,000.</P>

      <P>The financing of the capital programme depends not only on the result of the 1953 National Loan and future loans, but also on the success of efforts to secure small savings through the Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates, the extent to which moneys in departmental funds are available for investment and the possibilities of borrowing from other sources.</P>

      <P>Whatever criticism the Deputy may have of the efficiency of the Board of Works, if it were split up into a dozen different branches each attached to a Government Department and doing the work of that particular Department, I think it would be much worse.

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question, in so far as it relates to journeys on public business, is in the form of a tabular statement bringing up to date the particulars given in reply to a similar question which the Deputy addressed to me on <Col N="1660" /> the 12th March, 1953.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate this statement in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the question and in further reply to the first part, I am not prepared to ask any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary where he stayed, when abroad on private business or pleasure, any more than I would be prepared to ask a Deputy.  Neither am I prepared to ask our representatives abroad for the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the exercise of the entertainment functions appropriate to their posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the total number of workers employed by the Dublin Corporation from the 1st August, 1953, to date on special schemes for the relief of unemployment indicating the number employed in each week during the period; (b) the total expenditure incurred by the Dublin Corporation on such schemes out of moneys raised by the rates; and (c) the actual amount contributed to date by the Government towards the cost of such schemes; and, further, if he will indicate the number of workers which the Dublin Corporation proposes to employ on such special schemes during the period ending the 31st December, 1953, giving the proposed figures for each week up to date referred to above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken (Thar ceann an Runai Pharlaiminte) Mr. Aiken (Thar ceann an Runai Pharlaiminte)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken (Thar ceann an Runai Pharlaiminte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the total number of workers employed by the Dublin Corporation on schemes for the relief of unemployment financed partly from the Employments and Emergency Schemes Vote was 120 for week ended the 1st August, 1953.  During the month of August this number increased to 357, of whom 296 were unemployment assistance recipients, and that number has been maintained in employment each week since then until the end of October. The expenditure incurred by the corporation during that period, I am informed, amounted to approximately £40,000.  The practice, as no doubt the Deputy is aware, has always been for the corporation to meet the whole of this expenditure in the first instance and to secure recoupment subsequently of the Government share of the cost from the Employments and Emergency Schemes Vote.  Hitherto the Dublin Corporation has met 30 per cent. of the expenditure on such schemes, the State providing the remaining 70 per cent.  Owing to the exceptional circumstances of the current year the Government have agreed to meet 80 per cent. of the expenditure on all schemes approved for execution during the financial year 1953-54.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> As I indicated in the discussions on the Estimate for Vote 10, on the 22nd and 27th October last, the Government authorised in July last the putting in hands in advance of the usual time of winter schemes costing approximately £60,000, and they propose to allocate additional money towards the cost of suitable employment schemes in Dublin County Borough for the remainder of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Additional Dublin schemes for the relief of unemployment are under active consideration, including the list of works recently submitted by the Dublin Corporation to the Department of Local Government, but I am not yet in a position to state how many of these works will be approved or what the total grant to the Dublin Corporation will be for the current financial year.  A statement in this connection will be made when the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 10 is being introduced.  I am not at present in a position to give the detailed figures referred to in the last part of the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay, which is regretted, is due mainly to the arrears of inspections which accumulated in recent years.  It is also due in part to the fact that consideration of cases recently inspected was deferred for a short period this year because the original provision had been fully allocated. As indicated, however, in my statement in this House on 22nd October, 1953, in connection with the debate on the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes, the arrears of inspections are being steadily reduced, and certain additional funds are being provided for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>

It is immaterial whether the applicant's cottage is vested or not.  Generally, though, consideration of cottiers is preceded by the claims of ex-employees on the lands acquired, evicted tenants, local uneconomic holders and possibly others. I may say that if, in addition to his cottage plot, a cottier holds other lands he may be treated as an uneconomic holder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the attitude adopted by the Minister during the course of this debate, Deputies have experienced a certain amount of difficulty in making their speeches and in keeping within the Rules of Order so far as the subjects to which they can refer are concerned.</P>
      <P>In my view the Title of this Bill&mdash; the Supplies and Services Bill&mdash;is a misnomer because this Bill gives vast powers to various Ministers of the Government.  Its terms are entirely dictatorial.  I believe that the proper Title for this Bill would be the Public Safety Act.  Its terms and the powers it gives are such that it is entirely similar to that old Act of the British Parliament which was known as D.O.R.A.&mdash;the Defence of the Realm Act.</P>
      <P>One would expect, having regard to the fact that eight years have now passed since the end of the Second World War, that there should no longer be any necessity for the introduction of a Bill of this nature&mdash;a Bill which gives power to the Government, if they so desire, to extend this Dáil, for instance, for a period of 50 years or any number of years and, in fact, to prevent certain Deputies from entering Dáil Éireann at all.  There is no limit to the powers contained in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very astute move on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give this Bill its present Title&mdash;Supplies and Services Bill&mdash;instead of its proper Title, the Public Safety Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot prevent the Deputy from attending the Dáil.  He would have to be a service essential to the community before he would come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, the Minister can prevent the import of any commodity, even a very essential commodity.  He can also prevent the export of commodities from this country. In fact, there is nothing that cannot be done by the Government under this Bill, which is absolutely autocratic in its terms.  I understand, however, that in his opening speech the Minister stated that it would definitely be ended in the year 1955.</P>
      <P>If we refer to this Bill as the Supplies and Services Bill, and if the Minister exercises his full powers under it, something has certainly been done by which the supplies available &mdash;supplies of all kinds: foodstuffs, clothing and everything else&mdash;have reached such a high price to-day that people in our cities and towns, in particular&mdash;working men and working women&mdash;find it absolutely impossible to live in accordance with the decent standard of living that they would expect a Government to maintain in this country.  The position is so bad that many children are deprived of foods which are essential to build them up in a proper state of health and yet the Minister does not seem to have exercised any of his powers to keep down the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Party Government set up a Prices Advisory Body to investigate any claims to increase the prices of commodities.  Since the present Minister took office, we have not ever been told that he had recourse to that body in connection with the prices of essential foodstuffs or other commodities. The position in this State to-day is that, between high prices and high taxation, there is a good deal of unemployment&mdash;and where there is <Col N="1672" /> unemployment there will be emigration.</P>
    <P>While the Minister possesses powers to alleviate the distress which exists in many sections of our community, he is not doing his duty in striving to keep prices at a reasonable level and to reduce the unemployment figure which affects a vast number of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, the Minister interrupted Deputy Blowick to say that he longed for constructive proposals. I need hardly say that I do not believe him.  Nevertheless, I think it desirable that, when he makes that bluff, it should be called.  The first thing to which I wish to direct the attention of the House in connection with this Bill is that, as a result of the constructive work done by the inter-Party Government, without very much help from the Minister or his colleagues, who did all in their power to harass and confuse while they were in opposition, the exports of this country, as a result of the prudent policy pursued by our Government, bid fair in this year to exceed £105,000,000 sterling, after eliminating the Minister's valuable contribution to our external trade of sweetened fat and minced meat which amounted last year to something like £4,000,000.  They have vanished like snow in summer sunshine, but the agricultural policy of the inter-Party Government now coming to fruition not only takes up that entire deficit of £4,000,000 but promises to provide a total export value of £105,000,000 sterling, or perhaps a little more, the greatest figure ever recorded in the economic history of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House ought to dwell on that, because, if this event were not now transpiring, consequent on the work we did despite the unrelenting opposition of the present Government, this country would be bust wide open.  When Fianna Fáil left office in 1947, the total value of our exports was of the order of £70,000,000 sterling. It now bids fair to reach £105,000,000 sterling, and if you study the exports, you will find that they are not sweetened fats, not minced meat, none <Col N="1673" /> of the other exotic products sponsored by the Department of Industry and Commerce, but cattle, meat, sheep, pigs, bacon and pork, the despised products of the land of Ireland and of those farmers who Fianna Fáil had been concerned to say for the past five years are lazy, incompetent, old-fashioned and unworthy of continued occupancy of the land.  When will Fianna Fáil wake up to this fact, that the performance of the farmers on the land of Ireland since 1948 outshines the performance of any agricultural community in Europe?</P>

I am trying to point out that all the things that were done made very little contribution to the economic welfare of this State in so far as they were done by the Minister or those for whom he is responsible, whereas the agricultural community of this country bore, are bearing and will continue to bear, the whole burden.  It is on that front that constructive proposals can be made if there is any hope for the economic salvation of this country at all.</P>
      <P>I am going to make three proposals and I will give 6 to 4 now to anybody that they will all be categorically rejected by the Minister in his concluding speech and will all be put into operation within the next five years. I will give 2 to 1 on that proposition to any amount and I bet there will be no takers, in the Fianna Fáil Party in any case, because generally any suggestion made from these benches they try to adopt in their own flat-footed way as soon as they hope the public have forgotten whence the suggestion originally came.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes for which powers were granted under the Act was to control the cost of living, and I suggest a method now whereby 6d. per lb., and quite possibly 1/- per lb., can be taken off the price of tea within the next month, that is by declaring, as of to-morrow, that there is no control on the importation of tea.</P>

My constructive proposal is: Take it off altogether. Why have we got it on?  Why are the people of this country being constrained to pay 6d. per lb. more than they ought to pay for it?  I will tell you, because I happen to know.  A certain small group of tea wholesalers in this country came to know that the Minister had a bee in his bonnet and that that bee was that at the beginning of the European war, supplies of tea from London were suspended.  The Minister's quarrel, however, is with the then British Government, which has long ceased to exist, and the existing British Government dislikes it more than the Minister dislikes either of them.  He is quite resolved that he is going to carry on that quarrel, not with the British Government but with the wholesalers of tea in the City of London.  They never wanted to cut off supplies of tea from Ireland.  The more tea they sell, the more money they make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, go fish.  Why should a wholesaler refuse to supply his customers?  The British wholesalers did not rise up to wrap the green flag <Col N="1676" /> round them and then proceed to cut off their noses to spite their faces by refusing to supply tea to their customers. They would sell tea to Johnny Dog if they were paid, but they were told by the British Government not to sell any more tea to Ireland because the British Government wanted to keep all the tea for their own people. It is now rather late to start disputing the equity of that arrangement made in 1939 or 1940.  If there was to be any argument about it, it could not go on because the other party to the argument is gone and they can never come back.  That arrangement was made by a Government which was a coalition of Labour and Conservatives, and that you will never see again, in the Tánaiste's lifetime or mine.  There is no use in arguing the past when the other party to the argument is dead or liquidated, gone like a puff of air. He cannot be found; he will never be found; and you are simply arguing with a blank wall.</P>
      <P>Why should our people be asked to pay 6d. per lb. more for tea in order to wreak vengeance on something that does not exist?  That is just draft.  That would not work and the bee would not be allowed to buzz very long in the Tánaiste's bonnet if there was not a very powerful vested interest in Ireland that suddenly woke up to the fact that the bee in the Minister's bonnet was pure gold for them and then emerged this brilliant plan by which our tea was bought in Colombo and Calcutta, and only a limited number of persons would be allowed to purchase it&mdash;a few large wholesalers in Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>Once they get the wholesale trade of this country sewed up in a bag, there will be no agreement.  But there will be a weekly luncheon at which current prices of Orange Pekoe, B.O.P., Fannings and Ceylons will be discussed in the most gentle way. There emerges this astonishing consequence that when you write to 15 wholesalers asking for samples, there will not be one-eighth of a penny per lb. between the samples forwarded, and if you do not like that, you can lump it.  If you do not buy from them you will have no tea to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> It will be a great compliment to get any tea at all from them&mdash;loose tea. There will come a day when you will be told that the health officers wish all tea to be packeted before it is sent to a shop in the backwoods&mdash;shops which have no right to expect to have the same accommodation as shops in Ballsbridge or Rathmines.  Of course, you will be told that the price for packing tea has gone up.  It will be made up in a red packet, a blue packet and a green packet, all at different prices, and if you do not like it you can lump it.  You will be told that your customers can drink light beer if they will not drink tea from a packet, and if they will not drink light beer you can put up your shutters.  That is all there is to it.</P>
    <P>You will discover this further amazing fact: that wholesaler A has packed his tea in red packages, white packages and blue packages at three different prices, and wholesaler B has packets in green, white and orange at three different prices and they are all at the same three prices.  You can have any colour you like but there will be three prices and you will pay these prices or you can lump it or make your customers drink light beer, and if you cannot make them drink light beer you can put up your shutters.  Then they tell the public that they deprecate this interference with the free practice of their trade and that they exhort the Minister to withdraw control.  Did you ever see two fellows fighting at a fair?  &ldquo;Let me at him; hold me back!&rdquo;  The 15 wholesalers protest against this restraint and speak of delicate representations to the Minister when he proposes to consider the whole question but if he shows the slightest inclination to relinquish his control on tea they get a terrible shock.  There was a panic a month ago when there was some talk of the Minister dropping control.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Now, boys, you put up a scheme.&rdquo;  They protest that they will not put up any scheme, that they do not want any control.  When the Minister says: &ldquo;If you do not there will be no control scheme at all,&rdquo; there is immediately a desperate rush to place their services <Col N="1678" /> unreservedly at the disposal of the people of the Irish Republic, and they lodged a scheme before you could crack a match.  I say that it requires nothing but an Order under this Act to suspend the control of tea and if that is done, within one week the price of tea will be brought down by 6d. per lb.  I will give 6 to 4, even 2 to 1, on such an eventuality.  If the Minister gives the slightest indication to-day that he is likely to do it there will be a deputation of wholesalers over in Kildare Street that will frighten them.</P>
    <P>I make another proposal to the Minister.  Here is a proposal that would reduce the cost of living ten points in six months and would provide better protection for those who seek it, and a better quality merchandise at a lower price and in greater volume for every consumer in the country.  Let the Minister take any commodity he chooses, whether it be spades, woven underwear or children's readymade clothes and abolish the quota restrictions on the import of that commodity, inform the manufacturers of that commodity in Ireland that he proposes to reduce the tariff levied on that commodity to 20 per cent., and that he proposes to devote the revenue derived from the said tariff to give a subsidy per article on the corresponding commodity produced in Ireland.  Let us take, for example, a pair of stockings.  That pair of stockings is costing to-day, say, 1/- c.i.f. Dublin and we levy a tariff of 25 per cent. on that.  That means that henceforward it costs 1/3 f.o.q. and the Irish manufacturer has to compete with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Minister should make an Order under the Act on the lines suggested by me, which he could do perfectly easily, which would have the full force of law and bring down the cost of living by ten points; which would increase employment; which would serve the exact purpose for which this Bill is designed; that is by an executive Order to carry into effect certain reforms which will relieve the stresses in the economy of the country and so utilise the supplies of goods and the services in such a way as to derive the greatest possible benefit for the community.  Surely if I can propose to the House plans which can be given effect to under the Supplies and Services Act which will reduce the cost of living by ten points, which will increase employment, which will reduce the burden on the consumer, <Col N="1680" /> I am advocating the use of these powers in a way which will be for the benefit of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will judge whether we ought to give these powers by the answer of the Minister.  He said: &ldquo;Give me a concrete suggestion.&rdquo;  I will give him that, and I will decide to vote for or against the Bill when he tells me whether he will adopt the suggestion which I am making by using these powers.  If he does, I think he ought to have the powers; if not, I think he ought not to have them.</P>
      <P>It would be an extraordinary thing if the Minister could deride the Opposition by saying that they are not making any constructive proposals and, if the Opposition do make constructive proposals, they are to be told that this is not the time and the place to make them.  I look to the six weary weeks of precedent when the rights of Opposition Deputies were vindicated to speak trenchantly on unemployment and the cost of living.  When I think of the three points increase in the cost of living which kept this House going for six weary weeks and look at the 22 points that the modest Tánaiste clapped on within a week, it is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do you remember, Sir, every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, some of them who sat dumb for ten or 15 years, getting up and shrieking to high heaven the time the cost of living went up by three points?  Do you notice that not a single one of them has let a yap out of him or her ever since the cost of living went up by 22 points?  I confidently expected my distinguished and charming colleague from Monaghan, Deputy Mrs. Rice, to be holding meetings at the crossroads in Monaghan and asking the Minister to make an Order to raise the price of turkeys at least to the level at which they were when I occupied the position of Minister.  But every time the price of turkeys falls the heavier the silence <Col N="1681" /> that shrouds my colleague.  I am full of hope that she will call a protest meeting at any crossroads and I will be there to second any proposal which she has to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There was a time when we had the right to enforce a price for turkeys and the right to make an Order under this Act that if a jobber defrauded a woman who had turkeys to sell we would take the licence off him and put him out of business.  There has been no talk of that since the price of turkeys began to knock along the bottom.  We had not even mention of the price of eggs. I would not wish to cause my distinguished colleague any undue distress on behalf of the women of Monaghan, but I remember when she would rise from these benches saying that she rarely interposed, moved by her solicitude for the women of Monaghan because her sleep was disturbed by the cackling of the fowl.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it unreasonable for me to make suggestions which will increase employment and reduce the cost of living by a device which the Minister can apply in respect of any commodity? I simply take one by way of illustration.  We had reached the stage that one commodity is coming in at a cost of 1/3.  I suggest to the Minister that he should use the revenue derived from the 20 per cent. tariff on that to subsidise the domestic product. Does not that suggest a new procedure which would relieve the consumer, stimulate domestic production, bring down the cost of living, and in fact do all the things we want to do? If the domestic stocking costs 1/- to produce and the British stocking costs 1/- to produce, I suggest that we should subsidise the domestic stocking by a levy on the incoming stocking of 3d. and pay the domestic producer 2d. per pair on each pair he produces.  His competitive position <Col N="1682" /> then would be that he would have a 10d. article competing with a 15d. article.  Can we not then go to him and say: &ldquo;We started you off with an initial overhead cost of your product of 10d.; the incoming competing article we have levied to the point where its initial cost is 15d.  Now go and compete and let the consumer derive the benefit of your more energetic competition with the incoming commodity&rdquo;? I think that is a good idea.</P>
      <P>I think that if a lady resident in Ballsbridge wants to buy stockings for her children with frills and furbelows and has to pay 3d. extra on them so that the woman in more straitened circumstances and perhaps with a larger family can get a comfortable and serviceable stocking and find herself in the advantageous position, if she wishes to forgo the frills and furbelows, and having access to the more serviceable garment, that is made available by the contribution to the cost of the more serviceable garment made by the levy on the imported article.  Does not that reduce the cost of living and provide employment for our people in producing the kind of goods we want?  Does it not give an assurance that we will by this device not only protect the existing market for the woman who has to pay a retail price based on a 15d. cost but that other people can buy stockings at a retail price based on a first cost of 10d.? In that way this proposal would not only reduce the cost of living but be a substantial material stimulation to the domestic market as a result of reducing the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank gets into a state of apoplexy if you increase consumption by raising the total quantity of spendable money available in relation to the quantity of goods, but they rejoice if you raise the standard of living by maintaining the volume of money stable and reduce the cost of goods.  Come now.  We can bring peace to the restless pillow of the Central Bank.  That will appeal to the Minister for Finance.  I often wonder if it is his four-wheel cab I see waiting outside the Central Bank.  It is an interesting symbol because there is only one public building, I think, in <Col N="1683" /> Europe outside which waits a four-wheel cab drawn by an ancient horse and that is the Central Bank.  The Minister for Finance is always solicitous of that institution.  Here in my proposal is a method to bring peace and calm to the fevered pillow of the Central Bank, to bring down the cost of living and stimulate the domestic market.  Would the Minister do it?  I will give him 6 to 4 he will not&mdash;not at least until he hopes the House will have forgotten that it was I who proposed it and I will give 6 to 1 that by that time he will no longer have power to do it or not to do it.</P>
    <P>I will make another constructive proposal.  I make no criticism of past performances.  We had 20 years of intensive concentration in this country on what we have been pleased to call industrial development with an obbligato from the same inspired sources which alternate between thanking God that the British market for live stock was gone for ever and fierce phillipics against the lazy farmers who would not produce for export to the British market.</P>
    <P>The latest variation that we have to deal with is that we are bringing gentlemen from Denmark, Holland and all over the world to tell us how lousy we are, how incompetent we are and how we fall down on the job in the matter of research, modern methods, and everything else.  We are all quite oblivious to the fact that for 18 years in this country anyone who dared to have a four-legged beast on his land was regarded as a quasi-traitor.  Oh, yes.  Deputy Ó Briain smiles at that.</P>
    <P>I saw men in this country selling four-year-old cattle for £4 15s. apiece. My colleague, Deputy Mrs. Rice, saw people selling their turkeys in Monaghan for 4d. per lb.  We all joined together to send over butter for the British, who eat it at 8d. per lb. and we paid them 6d. per lb. to eat it. We got back nothing but the empty boxes and they eat the butter.  It was after that enjoyable 18 years that we found ourselves, in 1948, in the trough of despond and ruin agriculturally. Deputy Ó Briain doubts that <Col N="1684" /> but I notice that the rest of the faces on the Fianna Fáil benches are not quite as hilarious.  They do not forget that in 1948, after 18 years of that, there were less cattle, less pigs and less sheep in Ireland than at any time in the 20th century.  Some Deputies will not forget that cattle were dying of starvation on the land they grazed for lack of phosphates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make concrete and constructive proposals in a moment, none of which will be adopted by the Government.  If this country is to survive at all, I think we will all agree that we have got to be able to pay for what we import. The purpose of passing this Bill is to provide the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the powers to ensure that that will come to pass and, if it should not, to limit imports, restrict imports.  This Bill is habitually used for that purpose.  I want to suggest that it should never be used for that end.  It should be used to ensure that there shall be exports of volume and value sufficient to permit the enterprising elements of our community to import whatever they require, employ their neighbours to produce and to enjoy the fruit of their own labour. It has been made abundantly clear by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that as regards what he describes as industrial activity he can make no contribution to that end.  No industry is in a position to export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We brought over a team of American surveyors and their answer was &mdash;when they were asked to recommend ten commodities ripe and ready to be stimulated for export&mdash;very simple, because the answer was there was none.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce now regards himself henceforth, not heretofore, as depending <Col N="1685" /> for his reputation not on how far he succeeds in importing but on how far he succeeds in stimulating exports. He came down on the mineral water bottle manufacturers and informed them, if they were patriotic men, they would stand up and cheer when they were called upon to pay 36/- for bottles which were being sold in Northern Ireland and Great Britain for 22/-.  Could he not make an Order prohibiting that?  I asked him and he said he would not.  Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce deny that it is quite within his power, under this Act, to make such an Order as might be requisite to prevent the continuance of that practice?  I suggest he should do it.  He says himself that it is the only basis on which industry succeeded in making exports to-day.  I want to stimulate exports of a character which place no burden on the domestic consumer but which will ensure that the domestic consumer can have what he requires through the payments earned by the agricultural industry in the export market.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the first step might be, in fact, should be, to anticipate the approval of the Congress of the United States for the proposal of the Veterinary and Agricultural Science Institute in this country and go ahead with that so that those services will be available at the earliest possible date.  I suggest that a time has come when we should face the fact that the question of fertilisers and seeds is of primary importance in a country the annual rainfall of which is 42 inches as compared with the 22 inches for Denmark and 32 inches for Holland.</P>
    <P>I could conceive a Minister under this Bill&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture &mdash;properly sequestrating to himself in successive years the task of allocating fertilisers, taking each year a different fertiliser, and, on the same principle that we adopted in regard to lime, making in each successive year a particular fertiliser, in which the land is peculiarly deficient, available to farmers on terms which would induce them to use it on a scale heretofore unprecedented.  I think that a scheme to that end could be worked out, and in view of the manifest fact that there <Col N="1686" /> is no other source from which to get money to pay for the imports that our people require than the land, I think it would be justifiable seriously to consider emergency measures over the next ten years to bring that land up to the level of fertility requisite to get the production to provide the trade balances which we require.  I think that the parish plan should be brought into operation forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not discuss it then; let us leave it at that.  I have already mentioned the institute, fertilisers, seeds and the parish plan. The fourth thing that I mentioned was the expansion of artificial insemination. I do not know whether that can be done under this Bill or not.  An <Col N="1689" /> urgent and vital necessity is my fifth proposal, namely, the restoration of the land rehabilitation project to its previous vigour and activity.  I do not know whether the progeny-testing of pigs and fowl, at present in operation on a limited scale, is relevant to this Bill or not, but I think it should be developed and pursued.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Hickey is not here because I am now coming to something that is relevant to this Bill, and that is credit for farm buildings and machinery.  I want to say, with full deliberation, that this is something to which I have applied my mind not for a month or a year but for a much longer period.  If we are going to get effective progress in the equipment of the agricultural industry in this country, the time has come to make the money for that purpose, under approved schemes, available to farmers who use it free of interest.  If that is not done, no effective progress is going to be made.  I have myself seen in operation from both sides of the table schemes for the erection of farm buildings and the purchase of machinery.  I have seen men lay out £500 or £600, and then finding themselves subject to a charge thereafter of £30 per annum in respect of their outlay, only to discover that they would be paying that annual charge in perpetuity, and still just as deeply in debt at the end as they were at the beginning, whereas if the money were applied to a reduction of the capital sum originally borrowed by them, the position would be that in 12 or 13 years they would be free of their debt, and over that period would have been able to produce that much more as a result of the equipment with which they had provided themselves. I am not sure that I would not be prepared to sponsor that proposal, whatever our past history was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain, looking back on the days of Lord Lucan of County Mayo, who, in the vicinity of Castlebar, was known as the great exterminator, that it is right for us, the grandchildren of those whom he sought to exterminate, to tax our resources to ensure that those who hung on and frustrated Bingham's purpose and succeeded in <Col N="1690" /> retaining the land for our own people, should have redressed in our time the appalling handicap he sought to hang upon them.  It amused me to read some of our own neo-reformers in this our day telling us we ought to give up the idea of farmers owning and running their own holdings, and that we ought to lump the holdings together and ensure that the men who heretofore were little better than peasants would get a regular weekly wage to raise their standard of living.  These gentlemen do not know that Bingham, the great exterminator, who filled the workhouse of Castlebar until the floors and passages were covered with men, women and children, was the first prophet to enunciate that doctrine in Ireland.  He thought there were too many of the dirty Irish in County Mayo, and the only way to deal with them was to clean them off the land and group their paltry little holdings into decent farms and bring in industrious Scottish men to run these farms and employ the Irish. Bingham first proposed that in Ireland, and I make the suggestion that they ought to get a portrait of Lord Lucan and get a buttonhole made of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Poor silly Deputy Allen would greet its adoption or its rejection with the eloquent interjection: &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; so we need not worry for his peace of mind.  That is the seventh proposal I have to make. The eighth proposal I have to make is, I think, of equal value.  Seventy years ago, mark the date, there was a geological survey proceeding in this country.  A Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer came to the conclusion that economy for the benefit of the British Exchequer required that the geological survey in Ireland should be suspended because if the drain on the Exchequer continued they might have to stop the survey in England.  Therefore, the geological survey in Ireland was stopped, and it never was started again.  We have some very competent officers for this purpose, but there is a standing injunction to do nothing at all because there is no money with which to do it.  We are still eloquently repeating the observation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer of 1883. The Fianna Fáil Deputies are itching in their seats to say: &ldquo;What did you do about it&rdquo;?  I did plenty and only for the disaster of Fianna Fáil scrambling back to office on the backs of the three tulips, the busted flush, who have now dwindled away to a lonely joker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did attempt to procure an aerial survey of Ireland.  There has been an aerial survey made of Great Britain and, I think, of almost every square mile of inhabited land in the world except Ireland.  We had estimates prepared to have that survey made and the usual skirmishes were going on with the Department of Finance to procure the money.  That is the eighth of my proposals for the rapid expansion of supplies in this country, that the Minister for Industry <Col N="1692" /> and Commerce should resume the geological survey of the whole country, that he should renew the peripatetic ordnance survey and that he should direct the completion forthwith of an early photographic survey of the country.</P>
      <P>All these things could materially contribute to the increase of supplies.  I might warn him that if he tries to have the aerial survey made he will be obstructed by obscurantist elements in certain divisions of the Department of Defence.  If he puts his foot on their face as effectively as he puts it upon the face of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, I have no doubt they will be quickly expunged from the scene, but I am not so sure that he is willing to put his foot on the face of his fellow-townsman, the Minister for Defence, as he seems so happy to do, whenever opportunity arises, with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I feel that is a good series of constructive suggestions.  There is not one of them that would not produce immediate and striking results.  However, it is a comment on the kind of Government we have that we may be virtually certain that none of them will be adopted.  I look forward with amazement to the contribution which the Government proposes to make to the solution of our economic difficulties. We are to borrow large sums of money for the purpose of rebuilding Dublin Castle and the Naas Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us observe the situation.  Three years ago our problem was that there was a shortage of labour.  We had actually to bring skilled operatives back from Great Britain, induce them to come in order effectively to mobilise the building industry here.  Within three short years we are shipping the timber for building out of the country and we are using the Supplies and Services Act to start relief works in the City of Dublin and throughout the country.  Is it not astonishing that Fianna Fáil now considers it one of its great achievements to say to the public: &ldquo;Have no anxiety.  We are going to continue relief works for the next five years&rdquo;?  One of the relief works, he said, is that we will spend an unascertained number of millions <Col N="1693" /> rebuilding Dublin Castle.  I saw the model of the plan they had to rebuild Dublin Castle.  It lay in the ante-room to the Government meeting-room in Government Buildings for two years. I think the model cost £1,500 to make. It would occupy a large diningroom table.  Our advice was that originally the rebuilding was estimated to cost £4,000,000 but it was more likely to cost £9,000,000&mdash;if undertaken in 1950.</P>
    <P>Conceive the feelings of the people of this city when I am stopped by a friend of mine living in this city who has a good job as a motor mechanic at a fair salary and who tells me that he was up all last week chasing rats off the baby's cradle in one tenement room in the City of Dublin.  He says it is not a question of his not being able to afford a house.  He wants to rent a house and he is prepared to show what he is earning weekly and that he has saved a sufficiency to guarantee that his rent will be paid for any reasonably forseeable period.  There is not a house to be got, he says.  &ldquo;Oh, that could not be,&rdquo; I said.  He told me he has a wife and two children&mdash;one child is three and the other rising one in the cradle.  I rang up the Dublin Corporation and said: &ldquo;Here is a man with a wife and two children, living in one tenement room; he is not getting a right night's sleep trying to protect the baby from the rats.&rdquo;  No one could have been more courteous than the city authorities, but their answer to me was: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, there is no question of considering him for a house; we have not yet dealt with the people who are living five and six in one room.&rdquo;  Is not that right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They said: &ldquo;We are only coming to them; a man living four in a room cannot be given a promise that we will consider his case for 18 months to two years.&rdquo;  Now, that is the context in which we are going to spend £9,000,000 on building the castle.  Are we all gone daft altogether? Can you imagine the feelings of an unfortunate man who has the wages to pay the rent and who wants nothing but the opportunity of getting a house and paying rent for it so that he may <Col N="1694" /> have accommodation for his wife and children and be able to get a good night's sleep, when he is told that his case will not be considered for 18 months or two years?  But we are going to start work on the Castle forthwith&mdash;we have £9,000,000 to spend on it.  Can you imagine that fellow, when he turns in despair to see if he could not build a house for himself, and goes to the local authority and says: &ldquo;Tell me how I would go about getting a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act; I know a neighbour who got one and who is paying 22/- a week.&rdquo;  The local authority says: &ldquo;Yes, that man borrowed a couple of years ago but the same loan from the same local authority over the same term of years will cost you 34/- now.&rdquo;  Can you imagine the exasperation of the average working man to whom the tale is told?  When he goes to recite that to someone who wants to create trouble in our community, his exasperation is inflamed by being told: &ldquo;Stay in your tenement rooms; they are going to rebuild the castle; they have finished Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, and when the castle is finished they will see about you and the baby and the rats.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What a metamorphosis has come over the country?  Three years ago, I am proud to think, two things took precedence over everything else in the economic life of Ireland&mdash;the rehabilitation of the land and the housing of the people.  Three short years, and these two projects are supplanted by Dublin Castle and the Naas Road. Three short years ago there was nearly full employment in this country, and now the Government glories in the fact that they forecast abundant relief works for the next five years.  They are tearing up the tram rails, they are cleaning the Dodder, Glory Halleluiah! Ireland is on the march&mdash;down the Dodder and up the tram rails!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened to them?  Is it something to be ashamed of that we want to build houses for our own people?  Is it something to be ashamed of that we were able to give the smallest, poorest farmer in Ireland facilities equal to those of the richest <Col N="1695" /> landed proprietor in Europe?  Did the results not show that our policy not only paid dividends in social amenities for our own people but in hard cash for the benefit of the economic life of the country?  Why have we substituted for that, relief works, Dublin Castle and the Naas Road?</P>

      <P>I will read now for the Minister an extract from his favourite bible, the Report of the Central Bank of Ireland for the year ending 31st March, 1953.  At page 17 the following appears:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There seems to be a desire prevalent in many sections of the community to insulate their particular sectors of the economy from the effects of changes in the outside world.  With that object, agricultural and industrial prices are inflated beyond economic levels by means of guarantees, subsidies, quotas, tariffs and other arrangements. In a number of occupations, wage rates are higher than those in Great Britain and, unless these rates are offset by superior productivity, the prospects of developing an industrial export trade are not bright.  Money incomes in many spheres have continued to expand without a corresponding rise in output, and so have tended to inflate domestic costs, thus reducing our ability to compete in foreign markets and lessening the attractiveness of the country as a field for investment and for tourism.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not often agree with the directors <Col N="1697" /> of the Central Bank, but it is nearly time the Tánaiste came to brood on that paragraph.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House now a question I asked before.  It is all right to raise the price of wheat, for that is something within the discreation of our own people; if our own people choose to pay £3,000,000 per annum extra for wheat grown at home, that is their own business and they have a perfect right to do so.  That is what home grown wheat is costing us this year. Next year, if we have 4,000,000 barrels it will cost us £4,000,000.  But that is our own business.  That is something we can settle for ourselves.  I want to remind the House, however, that if one is trying to produce, or if one is seeking to evoke supplies to be sold on foreign markets one is committing economic suicide if artificially one pushes up the cost of one's raw material, because no amount of hard work will offset an arbitrary increase in the cost of the raw materials on which our people have to work.</P>
    <P>I told the House before, and I tell it again now, that I negotiated a trade agreement in London in 1951 and I am glad to see that Mr. Stanley Evans, a member of the British House of Commons, speaking on that matter yesterday in the British House of Commons, said that Mr. Dillon&mdash;and, strangely enough, he linked me with Mr. Péron&mdash;spent his time beating the British Minister for Food about the head and face&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to get a price which Mr. Stanley Evans thought was too big.  By heaven, if I beat them about the face and head with eggs, devil a much eggs they will be &ldquo;bet&rdquo; about the head and face with now.  But I do not mind that.  I told them that if they brought the price of eggs down they would get no cheap eggs from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1951 Trade Agreement in relation to pork, bacon and pigs linked the prices payable for Irish pigs, bacon and pork to the prices payable for pork, bacon and pigs to the British farmer.  I knew when I made that <Col N="1698" /> agreement that the price paid to the British farmer was based on an index founded on the price of feeding stuffs and I reckoned that if the price of feeding stuffs came down in Great Britain it must come down in Ireland because we were both depending on the same sources of supply.  The cost of imported feeding stuffs into Great Britain has come down twice in the last six months and there have been two consequential reductions in the price of pork, pigs and bacon in Great Britain and both these reductions have been reflected in the prices paid for these articles in this country.  Over the same period the price of feeding stuffs has been artificially kept up here. Maize is being quoted for December shipment in the Irish ports to-day at £26 per ton and Indian meal is being sold at £38 a ton to the feeder.  The price of that Indian meal ought to be 29/- or 30/- per cwt.  There is a surcharge maintained on the price of feeding stuffs in this country by our own Government at the present time of at least 6/- per cwt. on a balanced ration. If one reckons that it takes 8 cwt. to feed a pig from birth to 12 stone weight that means that there is a levy of £2 8s. per pig.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister there is not that much profit in pigs and if there is an artificial levy imposed on every pig produced in the West and South-West for the benefit of farmers in another part of the country what will happen is what happened here before.  Pigs will disappear and, remember, pigs will not come back again if they disappear. It was a hard, bitter fight to persuade the farmers to get into pigs again.  If that trick is played on them another time, if the number of pigs rises and they eventually produce an exportable surplus and prices are allowed to crash or their profits are extinguished by the costs of production, while they have no means of raising their prices correspondingly, they will get out of pigs; and, if they get out of pigs for a third time, all the king's horses and all the king's men will not get them back into pigs again.</P>

There is only one hope for this country and that is to clear out the whole ging-bang lot.  If one considers the question as to whether or not powers of this character ought to be put into the hands of this Government, the answer is categorically &ldquo;No&rdquo;, for they are so preoccupied with fighting one another and struggling for the succession that they have no thought of anything else.</P>

If these men are got rid of at a reasonably early date, the powers contained in this Act can justifiably <Col N="1701" /> be sought from Parliament in the times in which we live.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying anything about that.  We will not argue about that to-day.  I am suggesting that the Ministers of the Government might for the moment look back to their more radical days and inquire if this Tory passion for uncontrolled, free enterprise should entirely dictate their daily thought.  There are powers in this Bill which, situated as we are, a Government might properly want and might properly have.  Everything a Government does under this Bill is subject to the review of this House. I am not one of those who share the conviction that all delegated authority is intolerable because anyone who has experience of government now knows <Col N="1702" /> that government in a modern State could not be carried on without such delegated authority.  What is important is that this House should retain its right to review whatever is done under delegated authority.  We have that right and we should preserve it.  But if you abolish all these and bring in a whole series of Bills to try permanently to replace these powers you may discover that you are setting up a forest of Bills in the place of this instrument which it will be subsequently very difficult to bring under control.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to remember that when the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was before this House I warned the House that if they passed the Bill in its present form, giving the vested interest a right under it to seek to have fair rules of trade approved, the Bill would become, not an instrument of liberation for the consumer, but an additional padlock on the chains in which the vested interest seeks to tie him up.  Was not I right?  There has not been a single reference to this fair trade tribunal of an alleged abuse, but there have been about 17 applications from vested interests to have schedules of fair trading practices approved so that thereafter no citizen will dare to object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Bill has a certain relation to another inasmuch as all of them have a consequence.  I am suggesting to the House that if we abandon this Bill with the power of review which is inherent in Dáil Éireann and substitute for it a whole series of Bills which will subsequently become Acts, designed to furnish forth each Minister of the Government with the powers he wants in lieu of the powers that he has declined in this Act, we will see a forest of statutes the outcome of which <Col N="1703" /> may be far different from what this House believes it to be.</P>
      <P>Bear in mind what has happened in the case of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.  It is not a Restrictive Trade Practices Act any longer.  It is a restrictive consumers Act, under which charters will be established for the protection of trades from consumers, not of consumers from trades. I would suggest to the Government that they might think again before the end of this debate with a view at least to qualifying the Tánaiste's unqualified undertaking to abolish this Act before the end of 15 months.  We may all have bitter reason to regret such a decision if we take it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that up to the time Deputy Blowick was speaking he had received no constructive proposals. I have now made to him 11 separate constructive proposals, any one of which would be an improvement on the programme of this Government.

      <P>I will teach the Deputy a few more things before I am finished.  I wonder if the unfortunate individual whom Deputy Dillon was bewailing with regard to his housing position here this evening had a house in 1945, or was the housing position in this country better in 1945 than it is now?  I think that is a fair question, for in 1945 Deputy Dillon proposed here in the House the borrowing of some millions of pounds for the purpose of building a new Dáil Éireann.  He entered into a long wail at that time as to the condition of the present House, the room that was in it, and the facilities in it for Deputies; and he wound it up by telling us about all the beetles that were in the roof at that time.  I do not think that our housing programme was as well advanced in 1945 as it is now, but Deputy Dillon evidently thought then that we should spend some millions on the erection of a new Dáil which he afterwards endeavoured to father off on the Fianna Fáil Party or Government.</P>

      <P>Deputies should go down and read it.  In the 1945 Official Report they can read it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> I know that Deputy Dillon is very much upset and saddened in regard to those loans for farm buildings.  He was saddened when he gave up another plan that he had, a plan under which the farmer was to accept a bob a gallon for his milk and which had a very severe effect on supplies even up to the present when we had 157,000 milch cows disappearing in 12 months due to the activities of Deputy James Dillon and his offer to the farmers of this country of a reduction of 3d. per gallon in the price of their milk.  I am well aware of Deputy Dillon's anxiety as shown here to-day and his worry, because the agricultural community were going in wholeheartedly for the Fianna Fáil tillage policy.  I know his anxiety and worry of mind when he told us that beet was gone up the spout after the wheat, and I can imagine the upset it must be to him having to read in the papers that there was an increase of some 12,000 or 13,000 acres of beet this year, and that there is going to be an increase this year as a result of Fianna Fáil policy of some 200,000 tons of beet to the factories with resultant employment. I can imagine the misery that that must be to the individual who sent over to Cuba and out to Czechoslovakia for the sugar.  I can also imagine the worry it must be to him whose boast and delight was that the beet was gone up the spout after the wheat and the peat.  I can well imagine the worry it must have been to Deputy Dillon that there were produced in this country this year something like 80,000 or 90,000 extra acres of wheat.  I can well imagine the worry it must be to him, and the upset it must be to his applecart, after the three and a half years he spent endeavouring to wipe out of existence that tillage policy.  I can well imagine the worry that must be to him.  This is not, I admit, the time for going into those particular matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>So were the remarks of Deputy Dillon on that matter. I would like to assure the Minister for Industry and Commerce that that policy of increased production on the land is going to continue and that there will be further increased acreage of both wheat and beet next year.  The agricultural community have always held to one dictum, that it was the duty of the farmers of this country to provide food for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that there was a loss of £3,000,000 because the people of this country grew wheat this year. That was his statement here, that we could not grow it as cheap as on the foreign market.  That was just in keeping with the Deputy who made the very self-same statement in this House a few years ago as regards beet, and told us that he did not know how long the people of this country were going to continue on a policy of producing their own sugar which was costing the people £3,000,000 each year.  Evidently the £3,000,000 has gone up where the beet was going. He stuck to that, and as a result of the manner in which he dealt with the beet industry he found himself two years afterwards having to go out to the foreigner and to pay the foreigner for 74,000 tons of sugar, £12 per ton more than for Irish sugar produced in the Irish factories here.  That is rather a change.  Deputy Dillon's policy has been tried by the agricultural community and was found wanting, and he got the high-road and the wattle on account of it.  Now he comes in here endeavouring to bring forward the very self-same policy again, bewailing the production of wheat, bewailing the production and manufacture of our own sugar.  Then he came along on the beet.  Why?  Because he wanted to kill now the market that the Irish farmer has found in this country for feeding barley, because he wants again <Col N="1707" /> to have a market in this country for foreign maize.</P>
    <P>You would not need any land at all for the policy as preached by Deputy Dillon.  All you want is one big yard into which you will shove the pigs and get the foreign material, foreign grain, in and feed them in the yard.  You would not want any land, and it could be devoted fully to being the fruitful mother of flocks and herds and the production of beef for Britain.  That was the policy that Deputy Dillon, with the help of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, set himself to carry out in this country for three and a half years.  We have seen the result of it. Now we are on the march back.  We are back again, not through any compulsion but through the free action of the people and the agricultural community of this country in the production of food for our own people. Against the best market for beef that existed in this country for many years the wheat and the beet are proving more attractive propositions to the farmers.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>I wish to protest against the manner in which Deputy Dillon has succeeded in insulting certain Deputies of this House.  He comes up here and talks about the bursted flush and all the rest of this kind of vilification of certain Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cover the wider aspects of our whole economy on this Bill.  In so far as I raise economic matters, it will only be in relation to the Bill which is now before the House.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech, the Minister told us that the Government propose, by 1955, to introduce some permanent price control machinery.  I must say I was surprised that the Minister deferred the introduction of permanent price control machinery until then because, in this House in 1950, the Minister made a peevish and intemperate speech about the uselessness of the Supplies and Services Bill of that year, saying that it was quite unnecessary and unwanted and that, in fact, it should be scrapped and permanent price legislation introduced in its place.  Although that statement was made in this House in 1950 by the present Minister when he was sitting on the Opposition Benches, we are now told by him that it will be 1955&mdash;five years after that speech was made by the Minister from the Opposition Benches&mdash;before we see the permanent price legislation.</P>
      <P>In view of the length of time which has elapsed since the Minister stated that the Supplies and Services Bill is unnecessary and unwanted and that it should be scrapped and permanent price legislation introduced in its stead, I do not know whether we shall see that legislation by the year 1955 or what the character of the legislation is likely to be. I have an unhappy feeling about price legislation and all the talk we have heard about price legislation over the past two years.  We can see clearly that the Government are slipping away, day by day and month by month, from their responsibility for the regulation of prices in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Week after week and month after month, Price Control Orders have been repealed.  Week after week and month after month, something else is taken out of the control of the Prices Section <Col N="1709" /> of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Now, a whole collection of commodities have been allowed to ride free of any control or any effective supervision by the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;and we are going to have a further period of 18 months of it.  How much of the remnants of price control will be here at the end of 18 months it is not possible, at this stage, to forecast.  If the Government continue to shed responsibility for price control in the next 18 months as they have, in an accelerated way, shed that responsibility over the past two years, I venture to say that, 18 months hence, there will hardly be a Price Control Order in operation at all.</P>
    <P>I am one of those people who believed, and still believe, that price control is imperative.  It is imperative not merely in the general public interest but particularly in the case of those sections of our community who are compelled to live on subsistence standards.  Price levels for them are not the basis of a mere academic discussion. Price levels for them determine the standard of living in their homes.  If the Government adopt the attitude that price control is unnecessary and can easily be relinquished then for those people there will be a still bleaker outlook in the future than that which exists to-day.</P>
    <P>If price control is necessary, price supervision is even more imperative. One may say that there is a sufficiency of goods on the market to ensure availability of supplies, but we must not forget that it is possible for groups and rings so to orientate themselves as to fix prices on the market at levels which give them an unreasonable return on their money.  These days, people are struggling to make ends meet, to get the best possible value for meagre wages and to see that they get access to the sweet things of life. It is highly desirable that no group and no ring should feel that it is outside the range of supervision and control so far as price levels are concerned. Nobody will attempt to deny that the public confidence in price control, as exercised by the present Government during the past two years, <Col N="1710" /> has been rudely shaken.  The public have a feeling that the Government have thrown away from their own control the range of supervision which, during the past two years, at least assured the public that their interests would be protected in some measure against the rapacity of those who wanted to exact the highest possible price for anything they produced or sold.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be easy for the Minister or the Government to ride away from what should be their obvious responsibility&mdash;that is, to give the public an efficient system of price regulation, price control and, above all, price supervision so as to ensure that there will be no exploitation of the public and especially of the weakest and most defenceless section of the community.  Price control and price supervision are necessary for other reasons also.  Of course, the public do not take a deep and scholarly interest in the factors which affect price levels nor in the factors which go to make the ultimate wholesale and retail prices.  All they know is that every time prices rise and wages remain static, their standard of living is correspondingly reduced.  In the public interest, as well as from the point of view of promoting a wider knowledge of the factors which enter into price control and price regulation, I think there ought to be a permanent prices tribunal which, from time to time, would be asked to examine price levels in particular industries and, by means of a public hearing, to hold a full examination of all the factors which are involved in the fixation of prices.</P>
    <P>In that way, the public would be enabled to appreciate the factors which are at work and which ultimately determine the prices which they pay for the commodities which they purchase. I hope that when the Minister is replying to this debate he will give us some more information in respect of the future character of the price control machinery than we have got from him so far.  At most, we have an idea that, by 1955, some type of machinery will be produced.  We have heard rather vague references to a Bill which the Minister introduced in this <Col N="1711" /> House many years ago and which he subsequently abandoned.  I think the Title of the Bill was the Price Regulation and Efficiency Bill.  Beyond a vague reference to that Bill, and an intimation that we will see some kind of price regulation machinery in 18 months' time, we have no idea whatever of the direction in which the Government's mind is travelling, but we do know that, every day, the Government are shedding more and more of the responsibility which, previously, they had in regard to price control.  I do not think it would be irrational to bet or prophesy to-day that when this Bill goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas, more Price Control Orders will be repealed.</P>
    <P>It has lately become fashionable at dinners, functions and other occasions, for Ministers to talk in terms of approval and pride of what they describe as &ldquo;price stability.&rdquo;  What is the basis for all this ranting about price stability?</P>
    <P>What are the facts about price stability to-day?  Can anybody deny that prices are higher to-day than they have ever been in the past 30 years? Do the Government's figures issued by the Central Statistics Office not prove that the prices of commodities to-day are higher than they were in 1923, 30 years ago?  Does everybody not know to-day that prices are higher in Ireland than at any time of peace in living memory?  Never before in times of peace have we hit the price level we have hit to-day.  In face of these unchallengeable facts, we get people preening themselves that we have reached price stability.  We are now expected to take pride in the fact that we are paying 4/2 for butter that we could buy a couple of years ago for 2/10, but because we get the privilege of paying 4/2 for it, and have had that privilege regularly, constantly and with stability for the past 16 months, we are obliged to believe that there is a virtue in the stability which makes us pay 4/2 for 2/10 butter.  That is called price stability.</P>
    <P>We have another privilege to-day, of course, masquerading under the euphemism of price stability, that the <Col N="1712" /> people are now paying 5/- a lb. for 2/8 tea.  They have been paying that 5/- a lb. for it for the past 16 months, and now they are told to cheer up, to forget their wounds and their sorrows because we have reached price stability, which takes the form of having to pay 5/- a lb. for 2/8 tea, or, as Deputy Byrne says, 9d. for the loaf they could get 18 months ago for 6d. Then we have people saying that is price stability.  Would it not be a damned good job if we had no price stability, if that is what is masquerading as price stability&mdash;gearing prices up to this high level and telling the people that they ought to be glad they have that stability?</P>
    <P>Let us look at the stability we have.  I asked a question recently to ascertain the number of commodities that had varied in price since 14th June, 1951.  A natural kindness and regard for the feelings of Deputies prevents me going completely through this document, but it is a document of six pages showing increases in prices since June, 1951, which is pretty good going in a short period.  What is the range of commodities which have increased in price?  I will not go through them all; I will be satisfied to touch on those that affect the ordinary man and woman.  This document shows increases in sweets, milk, peas, yeast, fuel, petrol, paraffin oil, methylated spirits, coal, coke, electricity, gas, cigarettes, tobacco, agricultural machinery, bicycles, and various kinds of building materials. There is a source of consolation in the fact, as the House will be glad to hear, that one firm has reduced the price of pot scourers by 3/6 a gross on the wholesale price.  Other commodities which have gone up in price are sewing threads, slates, tablet soap, springs of all kinds, steel of all kinds and tiles.</P>
    <P>Coming to the food and drink group, we find that these are up in price: ale, beer, stout, whiskey, bread, flour and wheaten meal, creamery butter, cheese, cocoa, condensed milk, cream milk, unsweetened condensed milk, sugar and oatmeal.  In face of these increases, what is the purpose of telling us that we have reached stability? <Col N="1713" /> Has this Government in the past two years not been responsible for lifting the price level in that short period by a percentage which has not applied to any other period of two years since this State was formed 31 years ago? In face of these facts, it seems to me to be nothing short of a cynical mockery of the people's sufferings that we should be talking about price stability at the same time and in the same year as the Government issues that long litany of price increases inflicted on the community by the policy of the Department and the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Does everybody not know perfectly well that it is harder to live to-day for the ordinary man and woman than it has ever been in the past 30 years? At a recent meeting of the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers' Society in Dublin, references were made by people, who are not members of political Parties but religious, indicating that there was widespread unemployment and poverty in this city. Anybody with any connection with these charitable organisations knows that their funds now are not capable of alleviating one tithe of the distress they are called upon to relieve in consequence of the worsening economic situation.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the plight of those of our people who are compelled to exist on social welfare benefits.  Thanks to this Government's policy of increasing prices by more than 20 per cent. in the past two years, grievous hardships have been inflicted on many helpless men and women and young children up and down this country.  Take the case of the old age pensioner and relate the position of that man or woman to the problem of endeavouring to exist on the meagre pittances which they receive to-day under our social welfare legislation.  According to an answer by the Taoiseach in the House, on the 1939 value the £ is now 8/7.  The old age pensioner to-day receives as a maximum 21/6, and interpreting that sum in terms of 1939 purchasing power, that person is living to-day on less than he or she had in 1939.  In other words, although the old age pensioner of 1939 had an old age pension of 10/-, <Col N="1714" /> which nobody was prepared to say was adequate for that person's requirements, to-day, because of the increase in the cost of living, that person is trying to exist on a purchasing power which is less than that of 1939.</P>
    <P>Take then the case, in relation to prices, of widows and orphans.  The new maximum widows' and orphans' pension, the pension paid to a widow with two children, is 38/- a week. Thanks to the rise in the price level, that person is now getting in terms of 1939 purchasing power no more than 18/- per week.  Nobody will say that was a reasonable competence on which to expect a person to exist in 1939, and yet to-day we are giving that person only 18/- per week in terms of 1939 purchasing power to sustain herself and her two children.</P>
    <P>When you move from that into the other categories of human beings dependent on our social services, you find the very same catastrophic effects on their economy.  Their standard of living has been debased.  Their efforts to exist are efforts which inflict upon them intense pain and suffering.  I should like in that connection to refer to a letter which I received from a constituent this evening asking could she get any home assistance.  Her husband is 73 years of age and she is 68.  The two of them are living on 21/6 a week. I endeavoured to get home assistance for this poor unfortunate soul and the home assistance officer, when he visited her, asked her had she any live stock and how she fed the live stock.  She had not as much as a hare on her bit of ground.  She says in the letter that last week she had to pay 14/11 for a shirt for her husband and 3/10 for two ounces of tobacco.  &ldquo;You can imagine,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;how much I would have for feeding live stock, seeing that I have got to spend these two amounts out of 21/6 a week.&rdquo;  It is idle to pretend that we have a healthy economy while you have cases like that.  They can be duplicated up and down the country in every city and town, and furnish a clear indication that there is much yet to be done before we can view with any optimistic complacency the economic position of this country to-day.  I think it is no wonder that <Col N="1715" /> in consequence of the rise in price levels we have had an aggravation of the whole unemployment position.</P>
    <P>Documents issued to Deputies in the past few days contain some startling news.  We see that in the week from the 24th to the 31st October the number of unemployed in that week alone had risen by 8,000&mdash;8,000 up in consequence of the termination of the Employment Period Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 3,000 lower than it was this week last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that in a second.  They are all your figures. We are now in the position in which we have approximately 60,000 unemployed and, mind you, the whole effect of the repeal of the Employment Period Order has not yet been manifested in these figures.  Next week the figures unfortunately will be up again. The fact that we have 60,000 unemployed is a clear indication of how much solid work remains to be done, if we are going to rid ourselves of this cancerous disease of unemployment which is having such an appalling effect on the whole national economy. I think every Deputy, particularly Deputies who represent rural areas, will have no hesitation in acknowledging the fact that there is growing unemployment in the rural areas.  In my own constituency there are places in which there are very large numbers of unemployed, places where three years ago the problem was how to take unemployment schemes in rotation because it was not possible to line up sufficient unemployed there to work at the time.  Deputy Dr. Humphreys, I am glad to see, is in the House.  He knows Castledermot well.  I venture to say that if he stops there on his way home this week and asks anybody in the town why the number of unemployed there is so large, he will be told it is going up.  If he looks at the number registered at the Carlow Unemployment Exchange, he will find a different picture there from that which existed three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the figures to see if, even by comparision, there is any cause for jubiliation.  On the 5th November <Col N="1716" /> the figures were 59,390.  On the 1st November, 1951, they were 53,580&mdash; practically 6,000 fewer than this year. On the 4th November, 1950, the figures were 50,600 so to-day we have about 9,000 more people unemployed according to the Government's own figures, than we had in 1950.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to come to&mdash;all this, in face of the fact that emigration continues to rise at an alarming rate.</P>

      <P>How does this arise on the Supplies and Services Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way, that because of the general policy of increasing prices we have a situation in which people cannot buy the barest necessaries of life, much less the embroideries of life, although the purchase of these embroideries formerly gave a substantial employment to a considerable number of people.  So long as we have our economy geared to a high price level, while doing nothing to take up the sag of unemployment, the whole economic fabric of the nation must suffer.</P>
      <P>The discussion on supplies and services has always necessarily involved a review of the economic position from a prices and unemployment point of view, and, of course, as you probably know, Sir, on the Supplies and Services Bill last year, the whole matter was freely discussed.  I do not want to develop it to any great extent now.  I refer to it only from the point of view of showing the very serious economic position and the necessity for endeavouring so to bend our economy that, by an intelligent price policy, married to an intelligent economic policy, we can provide regular employment for our people under a price economy which does not impose on our people the staggering burdens inflicted upon them to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in respect of unemployment is high-lighted by the very serious position which has arisen in the past 12 months in respect to agricultural <Col N="1717" /> employment alone.  I do not say that this is directly due to Government policy.  This is a tendency which has been manifested for some years, but the tendency is now manifesting itself in more alarming proportions. The Government figures show that, comparing June, 1953, with June, 1952, there has been a decline of almost 22,000 in the number of males employed on the land.  If we had a healthy industrial position that would, nevertheless, be a cause of grave concern, but with an industrial position which affords no ground for satisfaction from any standpoint, it is alarming to find that in one year alone 20,000 males should have shed work on the land.  That is an economic portent which I think is not of healthy significance for the nation.</P>
    <P>If by mentioning these facts one can induce Ministers to recognise the seriousness of the situation and the need for action, there is some value in these discussions.  But I have before me a copy of the <i>Irish Press</i> for 5th November, in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, speaking at the annual dinner of the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, is reported as saying: &ldquo;Unemployment recorded on the 17th October showed that there has been a dramatic recovery in the general position.&rdquo;  I want to underline these words: &ldquo;a dramatic recovery in the general position&rdquo;.  On 17th October, according to the Government's figures, there were 50,900 registered as unemployed, and to-day there are 60,000 registered as unemployed.  The figure of unemployment jumped up by over 9,000 in the meantime.  What can you think of a statement by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, presumably one of the people directing Government policy, when he says there has been &ldquo;a dramatic recovery in the general position&rdquo;, when between the 17th October and the date upon which this paper was published the figures had jumped up by 9,000 or 10,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One set of figures does not bear comparison with the other, because the Employment Period Orders have now ceased to operate.  There has not been that increase in unemployment, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to box the compass.  The Minister knows well that these 9,000 additional people who trekked into the labour exchanges between the 24th October and the 31st October were people who were unemployed.  There was no use trekking to the labour exchange even though they were unemployed because of the fact that they would get no unemployment assistance benefit.  The fact that they were not registered at the labour exchanges did not prove that they were not unemployed.  It proved that they were unemployed and that it was not worth while trekking to the labour exchanges to record the fact that they were unemployed because there was no money or sustenance for them.  The Minister knows perfectly well, even though he may try to use the interruption as a debating point, that what happened when the Employment Period Orders ceased to operate was that many thousands who had been put off the unemployment register in the rural areas came back on to the register the moment the Employment Period Orders ceased. They are there now in all their pristine economic unity to be examined and to attest the fact that they are available for work and they are unable to get it. Yet the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs finds some solace in the fact that, apparently, he thought there was a dramatic recovery in the figure on the 17th October.  But the dramatic recovery has turned out to be one in which our unemployed people are now registered at the labour exchanges in much greater numbers than they were when the Minister spoke on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made some further references in his speech.  He talked about the increase in the volume of agricultural production and said that farmers' incomes were rising, that the rate of industrial output and the volume of exports were going up, that <Col N="1719" /> the price of agricultural produce was stabilising itself after an uninterrupted rise by 17 per cent.  He went on to make some reference to &ldquo;external assets cranks&rdquo; and the <i>Irish Press</i> gives this heading to the speech, &ldquo;Real Economic Progress Now Evident.&rdquo;&ldquo;Real Economic Progress Now Evident,&rdquo; and we have got, according to the Government's figures, many thousands more people unemployed than we had a fortnight ago. In addition to that, we have got about 9,000 more people unemployed than we had three years ago.  How, in the face of these figures, it can be said that there has been real economic progress is beyond my comprehension.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the situation in the rural areas again for a moment.  My experience of the rural areas in many parts of the country is that there is considerable and growing unemployment. To some extent we have been able to hold that down in many places by the diversion or diffusion of housing activities in the rural areas.  On these housing schemes, large numbers of persons secured employment.  Now, two things have happened in respect of housing.  The higher rates of interest charged have lessened the demand for house building.  There is no new builder going into the building industry to-day.  There are many, many builders going out of the industry and, unfortunately, some are going out through the bankruptcy court, as they have been badly stung by the fact that, having built houses, they find it difficult to sell them at an economic price, and they have heavy commitments to those responsible for financing their activities.</P>
    <P>Anyone who takes a look at the sites around Dublin which were developed for housing can see that building has practically ceased, that there is less house building going on than at any time in the last five years.  On many sites you could see 50 houses going up at the one time; now, if they are going up at all, they are going up in ones or twos.  Many people who had built houses have &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; bills on them now because there is no sale for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> In rural areas another situation developed. It is natural that you cannot build further houses if you have satisfied the need for them.  In many rural areas a considerable number of houses have been built and, because of the fact that they have been built and that the local housing need is satisfied in some areas, there is no need for building further houses in those places.  You may need houses elsewhere.  But, if local authorities who have tackled the problem seriously in order to satisfy the housing needs of the people are finding themselves approaching the stage in which they have broken the back of the housing problem, the same need for the erection of houses does not exist to-day as it did in other years, with the result that there is a considerable sag in the building of houses in those areas and the opportunities for employment which went hand-in-hand with house building have ceased to exist in those areas.</P>
    <P>What is the ordinary working man in those areas going to do?  Deputy Corry drew some satisfaction from an increase in agricultural production. There is virtually no increase in the volume of agricultural production.  We may juggle with figures anyway we like because of rising prices on the external or home market; we may say that our agricultural production to-day is X-million pounds greater than it was a few years ago, but we are all the time dealing with a static volume of produce.  This year we increased the wheat acreage, but we decreased the oats and barley acreage, and the net result was that, taking the three crops together, the area under the cultivation of the three crops was less than it was last year.</P>
    <P>I am not saying these things in any spirit of political partisanship, but the challenge to this House and this nation is the utterly inadequate use we are making of the enormous potentialities which reside in the land of Ireland.  Whether this Government or any other Government is in office, we will never have a healthy economy until such time as we get out of the land the produce which it is capable of providing under an intelligent <Col N="1721" /> agricultural policy.  If we can agree on what lines that policy should take and only disagree as to the speed with which we can put it into operation, I think we can make marvellous progress from the standpoint of gearing-up our agricultural possibilities to a greater rate than I see there at the moment.  The fact of the matter is that our agricultural production has been stagnant for 50 years.  It has been a challenge to every Government which has ruled the destinies of this country over that period.</P>
    <P>Unless we get down to examine the basic causes of that and find the remedy, we will have the same stagnant agriculture, large pockets of unemployment in the rural areas with a rural area not capable of sustaining the industries which are inevitably associated with the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>On this Bill, because it deals with food, services and supplies, I would call the Minister's attention to what looked to be a promising new industry &mdash;the development of the dead meat trade.  I do not want to talk about it in detail and with all the knowledge I have on it, but I am bound to say that there is cause for grave disquiet in that particular field.  About 40 of these meat packing plants were erected in the past couple of years.  A considerable sum of money was invested in them and there were high hopes that we would develop a dressed meat trade which would provide a stable market for our cattle and employment in the small towns in the rural areas for many who were previously unemployed and that by building up that particular trade and dressing the meat at home we would get valuable offal which would, in turn, provide the raw material for many other industries.</P>
    <P>The first difficulty these folk met with was the closing down of the American market.  That in itself was not a serious or an insuperable difficulty but the position now is that apparently they cannot fulfil their contracts on the British market with the result that I do not believe there is one of these 40 meat-packing plants in full operation to-day.  I know there are dozens closed down almost entirely and <Col N="1722" /> there are some of them on which considerable money was spent, simply lying there as silent as a cemetery.  I understand the reason is that they cannot get cattle at a price which would enable them to dress the meat for sale on the British market at the price decided by the British Ministry of Food.  The Government might take steps to relieve the causes of that difficulty. I understand that one of the difficulties is that they cannot compete with those whose cattle are attracted to the British market via the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we are now heading for a situation in which practically all the money which has gone into these plants will be lost unless some serious effort is made to devise an arrangement by which they will get cattle for dressing.  If they can do that, then I think they can provide substantial employment in these plants. Close on 4,000 people would normally get employment in these plants but there only 400 employed in them at the moment due to the difficulty of buying cattle at a price that will enable them to sell the cattle in the British market.  I do not blame the Minister or the Government.  That is one of the things which has arisen out of the pattern of our live-stock industry and the methods of our live-stock trade but it is a great pity and it will be a national tragedy if these dressed meat plants are going to be allowed to die.  Several efforts were made from time to time to develop a dressed meat industry.  There are powerful interests here and elsewhere who do not want to see us do it.  It is a valuable industry from our point of view.  A considerable sum of money has been sunk in these plants and if these people should lose their money now the unemployment that will inevitably follow will burn as effectively as possible the fingers of anybody who wants to pioneer on that road.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Government's policy is in respect of this.  I think it is highly desirable, because of the employment and raw materials which it provides, that we should encourage it in every possible way.  We <Col N="1723" /> do not know what the Government's policy is, but the Minister could do few more useful things than indicate that the Government are determined to save that trade by making use of the devices which are open to them in order to effect the necessary assistance to the industry which is now passing through a particularly bad time.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will in his reply to this debate take some steps to indicate that the Government is alive to the dangers which beset this industry and alive to the loss of actual and potential employment which would follow if these industries are compelled to close down.  It should not be outside the bounds of possibility to devise an arrangement by which these plants can be kept in operation and some arrangement made by the cattle trade as a whole with governmental advice whereby it would be possible always to siphon off a sufficiency of cattle to enable these plants to continue to provide the employment which undoubtedly they can provide in a much greater measure than the exporting of cattle on the hoof, and at the same time establish here a really indigenous industry associated with our cattle trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made some reference to the Central Bank Report, but I do not think it would be appropriate on this Bill or at this stage to make any references to what is contained in this customary blue book of despair which has been issued by the Central Bank. It seems to follow the usual pattern. The only thing changed on it is the date.  It is substantially the same as it was five years ago and it will probably be the same in the next five years.  I do hope, however, that it will not commend itself to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Somebody offered Disraeli a book on one occasion on which he was not terribly keen.  He took it from the donor and said he would lose no time about reading it. I hope the Minister for Finance will adopt the same tactics in connection <Col N="1724" /> with this blue book of despair.  It is only intended to make people miserable. It is only intended to irritate the Irish people and advocate the philosophy of loving rags, of being proud to live a poor, impoverished life in Ireland for the privilege of living in this motherland.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to waste time on this.  I hope the Minister will repudiate it as he did last year even though, subsequently, some of his colleagues really devoted time to an intensive study of it and wasted much public time in relating the dire and sad sentiments which were contained in the report.  Notwithstanding what the Central Bank says or the occasional rantings which we get in this House from the Minister for Finance about impending gloom and disaster, I am convinced that there are only three ways in which we can build up an economic fabric to gain a decent standard of life for our people.  We have in this country soil and climate which is the envy of every other country in Europe.  We are economic and political lunatics if we do not ensure that the soil is utilised in a way that will give us a greater measure of agricultural and dairy production than we have to-day.  It is no visitation of God that we have not a greater measure of industrial production in this country.  All the difficulties and impediments are manmade and can be remedied overnight if the Government and the Minister take steps to recognise the enormous waste, actual and potential, which is inevitable when following our present-day agricultural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of industry, while we have immense difficulties, in the form of keen competition, in finding a foreign market, we nevertheless have at home a safe market by which we can shelter our people from the worst of the economic blasts that blow from other countries.  We can ensure in the home market prices that will give a reasonable return to industrialists, and we are entitled to expect them, in return, to undertake to the nation that, within their capacity, they will supply the nation with all the commodities which it needs and will play their full <Col N="1725" /> part in endeavouring to find an export market for any commodities which they can produce for that market.  Over and above these two considerations, we have got all the benefits which will flow, and which can flow, from the adoption of a capital programme of development, a programme which will give us national assets of a permanent and enduring nature, and which will add to the nation's wealth and will pay dividends, money if needs be, but in any case will contribute to human happiness and to a rising and ever-expanding national economy.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is only by a full-blooded development of our industrial and agricultural possibilities, by utilising the nation's assets here and elsewhere, together with the savings of our people in a programme of capital development, that we can ever attain the targets which will mean a decent living, and rising standards of living, for our people.  One thing is certain, and that is, that if we do not adopt a policy of industrial and agricultural expansion, geared to a higher level than at present, and do not pursue a policy of capital development which will provide employment and enduring assets for the nation, then this House will continue to discuss the difficulties of living and of life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It will continue to discuss the ever pressing problem of unemployment, the low standard of living for many of our people, and unemployment and under-employment will be permanent problems so far as we are concerned. If, however, we recognise that reliance on the methods which we have pursued in the past, will only give us the same bleak results in the future as they have given us up to now, then we can probably get broad national agreement on a policy designed to expand our industrial and agricultural potentialities. By doing that we can probably reach a production level which will not only finance our social services but will, at the same time, meet the capital charges in the development stages of valuable national works.</P>
    <P>I think that while we have had some indications from the Minister in recent speeches that his line of policy was bolder and more courageous than some <Col N="1726" /> of the utterances we have heard from some of his colleagues, I feel that if the Minister would take steps to indicate in some detail what the Government's precise plans are in the field of industrial and agricultural development, it might be possible for him to get not merely in this House but outside of it a volume of goodwill and of enthusiasm for a policy calculated to remedy the economic defects in our agricultural and industrial fabric, which at the same time would provide some remedy for our continued unemployment and for what is worse still, the haemorrhage which emigration means to the life blood of a nation.</P>

      <P>This debate gives Deputies an opportunity of voicing their own opinions as well as those of the electorate on conditions as they have found them affecting the country over the past 12 months.  In my opinion, if the people were asked to state in what particular way this Government has been most remiss and on what particular aspect of policy they had failed most miserably, the answer would be in relation to the twin problems of unemployment and the cost of living.  Some people seem to think that these problems are principally identified with the urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that they are, but it should also be remembered that there is not a part of the country which to-day is not gravely concerned by the numbers of unemployed in it.  The fact is that those who are in employment see that they are able to buy only very little with the wages they are earning. The same is true of those on small holdings in regard to what they get for their produce.  There has been an ever increasing rise in the cost of living over the past two and a half years. That certainly was not envisaged by the people when they went to the polls in 1951.  At that time, the cost of living was a very prominent feature in the programme of the then Opposition Party, and in the criticisms which they levelled at the outgoing Government. They charged it with not having kept the cost of living stable during its three and a half years in office.  These criticisms by the then Opposition were <Col N="1727" /> accepted by many people as indicating that a change of Government would secure for the entire nation a reduction in the cost of living, or at least an immediate cessation of any rise in prices.  Far from there being any reduction in prices, we have seen in the past two years an extraordinary increase in the cost of living.  That increase has not been due to any circumstances operating outside the shores of this country.  It has been attributable, purely and simply, to Government policy.  The result of that policy has been that the State has had to find compensatory benefits for many sections of our people.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past two years, local authority and other employers have had to seek some measure of compensation so that their employees would be in a position to meet their ordinary commitments and to maintain themselves and their families in a reasonable degree of comfort and security.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when speaking recently at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, said that we had now reached the point when we had compensated all these people.  That, of course, did not give a true picture of the situation. Would the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or any member of the Government or any back bencher supporting them tell us how an ex-employee of a local authority on 15/- a week is in a position to meet the fresh charges imposed on him or her by a further reduction in the purchasing power of the £?  How can that person afford to pay present prices for bread, tea and sugar and other necessaries of life out of 15/- a week?  There are many sections of our people who have got absolutely no increase whatever in their allowances to meet the recent increases in the cost of living.  Can any member of the Government, or any Deputy supporting it, deny that the old age pensioner, whether he is receiving 21/6 a week, 16/6 or 11/- a week, is not seriously affected by the fact that he or she has now to pay ever so much more for every single item of food?  Many of those people have to bear not alone the direct consequences of the increase <Col N="1728" /> in the price of the particular items they require because of the abolition of subsidies but also the burden imposed on them because so many people who have to meet these increased charges are in a position to pass these increases back again on the person at the end of the queue; and the person at the end of the queue is the person least able to bear these impositions.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that people who are self-employed have been unable to secure an increase in their income to meet the higher cost of living. We have provided some compensation for certain sections in the community but the general upheaval created has left its mark on every Department of State and on every section of the community.  There has been an extraordinary increase in the cost of running our public institutions and local authorities have been obliged to increase the rates in order to meet their heavy commitments.</P>
    <P>It is in connection with unemployment that we find most fault with this Government.  The increased cost of living has imposed great hardship on the unemployed.  Even if unemployed persons obtained an increase in unemployment assistance, it was swallowed up immediately by the price they had to pay for essential commodities.  Let no one from the opposite benches shout across: &ldquo;What about the producer?  Are you defending a reduction for the producer?&rdquo;  We certainly are not because the buffer which existed as between the consumer and producer was completely annihilated when most of the food subsidies were abolished.  It is only three years or so since the State was in a position to soften the impact of any rise in production costs; the consumer was not called upon immediately to bear it.  The Government has thrown every aspect of public life into disorganisation and caused great distress among the people.  It is a pitiable sight to see in our cities and towns the queues of people at the labour exchanges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking the retention of certain powers for a further period.  Government policy has made it impossible for a great many of our people to avail of either the supplies or the services because the Government has taken from them their way of living. They have embarked upon a financial policy which has made it impossible for many people to keep their families in reasonable comfort.  Many firms cannot afford to keep their workers in full employment which they previously enjoyed; they are working only parttime and unfortunately some of them are obliged to have recourse to the employment exchanges in order to secure some means of supporting themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We await the reply of the Minister with interest.  We await any comments his colleagues in the Government may have to make in the course of this debate so that they can explain how this small country which, thanks to Divine Providence, was spared from the horrors of war, should within a few years of the cessation of hostilities be called upon to meet an increase in the cost of living far in excess of that of any other nation in Europe with one exception.  Most of these nations were imperilled and have had to face serious commitments since that time in trying to rebuild their country.  We were led to understand in Ireland that we were as immune from the results of that conflict as it was possible for us to be but we can now point to the increases in the cost of living.  We point to the fact that although the previous <Col N="1730" /> Government had many other great responsibilities to face up to, one of its greatest achievements was to keep down the cost of living which was continually increasing up to the time they took office.  Then in their latter months of office due to circumstances over which they had no control&mdash;the diversion of shipping and other incidental happenings which arose out of the Korean conflict&mdash;there was a rise of a few points in the cost-of-living index. Now with import prices falling and the world returning to some measure of calm, we certainly wonder why so many people would be denied what is surely their birthright, employment in their own country.  It is the duty of the Government to give them employment and to try to keep down the cost of living so that people may have a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>Everybody one meets, no matter what his walk of life may be, has a complaint about the present state of affairs, and it is unfortunate that the people who suffer most are those least able to bear it, the people in the smaller income groups who have to rely on the staple foods, bread, tea and sugar.  It is those who have the very least by way of income, whether it be a pension or wages secured from employment, who are affected most rather than those with bigger salaries and income.</P>
    <P>Those articles which were subsidised &mdash;and which, if still subsidised at all, are subsidised only in a very small way&mdash;formed their principal items of diet.  For that reason, they felt the outcome of the abolition of the subsidies far more than others.  We find now that those engaged in self-employment, those in production, particularly the small farming class, have to bear many other costs passed on to them by middle-men who are able to recompense themselves for any difficulties they had to overcome.  Now the consumer has also to face the fact that those producing the vital necessaries of life are meeting increased production costs as day succeeds day.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the effect on our public institutions.  Anyone, no matter what his Party, who is a member of <Col N="1731" /> any hospital board or board of assistance will agree that over the past two years we have had to meet extraordinary increases even in a few items relating to the maintenance of those people it is our duty to look after. That increase has been met by an increase in rates or by some other means.  Therefore, we can assume that every housewife has to face the same responsibility.  Very often they are very vocal on this matter and when given the opportunity they can record their displeasure very emphatically. That displeasure has no doubt increased because of the fact that they were led to believe by the Party opposite before they attained office that if given an opportunity they could do something useful in this respect. Naturally, the extreme criticism which the Party opposite offered to the previous Government, for failure to deal with a simple three points increase due to forces outside the control of any Government, brought to their Party a measure of support.</P>
    <P>They presented a programme to the Dáil showing emphatically that if they secured election they would control the cost of living, which is one of the items they promised to deal with.  In particular, they were to deal with rising costs, but now after two and a half years of the present Government, scarcely a month passes without some increase in the cost of the necessaries of life.  That is in addition to the extraordinary increases people have to meet in regard to simple luxuries they may enjoy.</P>
    <P>I wish also to express my grave concern at the numbers of young people who are leaving this country, seeking employment in England, Canada, Australia and elsewhere.  We know there always was emigration, but it was never on the scale it is on at present. I do not think it was ever known for whole families to move completely out of this country, as occurred in the last two years.  I cannot say it happens in my own constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>However, we know that applications come in from <Col N="1732" /> people who wish to remove furniture to new homes in Britain.  In my own constituency there are young men and young women emigrating as they cannot find work at home.  Much of that is to be attributed to the failure of the Government in giving them some encouragement that they would secure employment and that what they would receive in wages would be left to them to buy the simple necessaries of life and the simple luxuries that should be available to them at reasonable prices. Now, they cannot see any future as long as this Government persists in the policy it has pursued since it secured election two and a half years ago.  It is vital that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would appreciate that these conditions exist.  It is up to him and to the Government of which he is Tánaiste to take immediate steps to ease this burning problem of the cost of living and to put into productive employment the large numbers that those in employment have to maintain on the dole at the present time.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that over the week-end the leaders of the Fine Gael Party held a conference and decided that the reports which appeared in the newspapers of the speeches which were delivered from their benches on this Bill last week were doing them political harm.  I think they were right in that.  I am quite certain the people do not like to hear their public men caterwauling about the adverse factors in the national position without making some effort to deal with them constructively, without taking some responsibility for the putting forward of positive suggestions for dealing with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They sent Deputy Dillon in to-day to make constructive suggestions.  Whether his effort has repaired the Fine Gael dykes or not is a matter of opinion.  No doubt some people may think the suggestions he put forward may have something in them; and if their propaganda <Col N="1733" /> department keeps on repeating often enough that they are constructive suggestions, an odd person here and there may believe that something of that character was put forward.</P>
      <P>Many of the speeches which were delivered in this debate did not seem to me to have any direct relation to the Bill.  I intend to confine myself to matters that do arise properly from the Bill before the House.  I agreed earlier, when questions of relevancy were discussed, that the cost of living was one of those matters, because at the present time the powers that the Government exercises to control prices are conferred by the Supplies and Services Act, and if that Act should be allowed to lapse or be defeated by a vote of the Dáil then powers to control prices would disappear with it.</P>
      <P>All the efforts of the Opposition speakers were directed towards establishing that increases in the cost of living are solely the responsibility of the Government.  They endeavoured to suggest that some course of action was open to the Government which, if followed, would have prevented the cost of living rising.  In order to secure whatever political advantage might be obtained by establishing that point, they sacrificed any lingering remnant of reputation they may have had for understanding the problems of this country; they sacrificed all honesty and any attempt at fairness in debate. Every Fine Gael speaker ran away from the real issue of prices.</P>
      <P>One or two of them, such as the last speaker, who, in the course of his remarks began to get within reach of the realities of the situation, decided to duck at once and to get back to the old theme: the Government could have done something and, because it did not do it, the cost of living has gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello, who opened the debate for the Fine Gael Party and delivered the most dishonest speech of all those made during this debate, started off on that line.  He took certain selected facts and based his argument upon those, suppressing all the other facts and every statistic available to him which appeared likely to invalidate the conclusion to which <Col N="1734" /> he was trying to lead the House.  He said that it is an extraordinary situation that for two years import prices have been falling but the cost of living has nevertheless been going up.  On the basis of that assertion he built his entire case that responsibility for the rise in the cost of living rests on the Government and that it was within the power of the Government to prevent that rise taking place by some administrative action.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that since June, 1951, there has been a slight downward tendency in import prices.  The import price index number showed, as between June, 1951, and June, 1953, a decrease of 9 per cent.  As to when a decline in import prices might be expected to show itself in retail prices is a matter upon which we might argue, but that is not the argument I want to make.</P>
    <P>The point I want to establish is that import prices are less important than internal prices in determining the cost of living.  It was surely dishonest for a Deputy, who was seeking to establish the case that the rise in the cost of living could have been prevented by some action of the Government, to have quoted these import price statistics and to have ignored every other statistic bearing upon that question; to ignore, for example, the fact that during the same period agricultural prices increased by 15½ per cent.  Most Deputies will, I am sure, recognise that the price paid to farmers for milk and vegetables and wheat has a far more direct bearing upon the cost of living than the price we pay for timber, fertilisers, newsprint or oils.</P>
    <P>There was no straightforward reference to the rise in agricultural prices during that period or to the effect of that rise upon the cost of living and every Deputy who came by accident in the course of his remarks within range of the question of agricultural prices said straightway that he was not in favour of reducing any agricultural prices and then got quickly on to some other aspect of the problem.  Surely it was relevant to remark that during the same two-year period since this Government returned to office in June, 1951, wage rates in manufacturing industry increased by <Col N="1735" /> 22 per cent.  The index of wage rates in manufacturing industry which was 170.8 in 1951 rose to 191.6 in 1952 and to 209 in 1953.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must understand me.  I said the cost of living has gone up and if we propose to consider what action could have been taken then or should be taken now to deal with the question of the cost of living we have to consider something more than import prices. We have to consider the prices paid to farmers for the food produced by them and the wages paid to workers. The fact that agricultural prices and wage rates have gone up has surely a very direct bearing on the cost of living at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take these four sets of statistics and see what conclusions we should draw from them.  Since 1951, and notwithstanding the reduction and alteration in food subsidies, about which some Deputies have been so eloquent to-day, the rise in the cost of living as disclosed by the cost-of-living index number was less than the rise in wage rates or the rise in agricultural prices.</P>
      <P>Again, let me remind Deputies of the figures.  Since 1951 the cost-of-living index number has gone up by 12.6 per cent.  Farm prices have gone up by 15.5 per cent. and wage rates by 22 per cent.  Therefore, it is a fair conclusion that to-day as compared with 1951 both farmers and workers are better off in real terms than they were in 1951.</P>

      <P>It is certainly true of the worker in employment.  It is true <Col N="1736" /> of the worker who has secured the average increase in wages which the wage index number reveals.  The average rise in wages has been greater than the average rise in the cost of living over that period.  If the Deputy says that is not true what the Deputy is really saying is that the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office are to be discredited.  I do not accept that.  There is another conclusion to be drawn from these figures and it is that the level of agricultural prices and wage rates affects the level of retail prices far more than the cost of importing materials from abroad, the level of import prices.  Any Deputy who gives a moment's common-sense thought to this whole problem must realise how obvious it is that there can be no reduction in the cost of living unless farm prices and wage rates come down as well.</P>

We do not believe it is desirable that the Government should take action to force down either farm prices or wage rates.  The Opposition's criticism of the rise in the cost of living, their refusal to face the realities of the cause of that rise and the whole implication of their observations, if they understood it, is that farm prices should be lowered and wage rates reduced at the same time so that the level of retail prices would come down.</P>

      <P>Deputy Declan Costello asked me for a statement of the Government's attitude on this matter and, in reply, I refer him to the statement I made on the Supplies and Services Bill on 4th December last.  At column 880 of Volume 135 of the Official Report I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the position now, and what is the position likely to be in the future?  I think it is true to say that only internal factors are causing prices to go up now.  The import price index number has fallen fairly consistently since the first quarter of this year.  The cost of goods imported into this country and used for industrial and agricultural purposes is tending downwards, but the effect of that fall in material costs on our price level is being offset by rising internal costs.  There is a fair prospect that when these adjustments in internal costs are completed a position of price stability will be realised.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the forecast I made last year and the only claim I make now is that that forecast was borne out by the events of 1953.  So far as it is possible for the Government to influence the trend of prices, and every Deputy who understands the matter knows that the power of the Government to influence the trend of prices is very limited indeed, its power will be directed towards keeping prices stable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they are.  It is not possible for the Government to control price levels absolutely unless they are prepared to control every factor that makes up prices, including wages, farm costs and all the other factors the Deputy has in mind.  We do not propose to control any of these except to the extent that it is necessary and vital in the public interest and certainly control will not extend either to farm prices or to wages.  In so far as it is possible to influence the trend of prices that influence will be exercised towards keeping prices stable.  We think that stability of prices will facilitate our progress, that the consequences <Col N="1738" /> of price fluctuations up or down are likely to be bad and that we are far more likely to improve the standard of living of our people and to secure the economic progress of the country if we can hold out the prospect that the value of money will remain stable for a reasonable period ahead.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said that price control is not being enforced, that there are groups and rings extracting undue profits&mdash;extracting, he said, the last penny they can from the consumer in order to enhance their profits.  If the effectiveness of price control is to be determined by the profits made by traders and manufacturers &mdash;and may I say that I do not necessarily agree that that is so, but that is the test Deputy Norton wants to apply &mdash;then the contrast between price control in 1952 and the Coalition Government's effort at price control is very striking indeed.</P>

      <P>Taking 1950 as a typical Coalition year, the last complete year in which they were in office, retail grocers in that year made profits which <Col N="1739" /> represented 3.07 per cent. of their turnover. In 1952 their profits fell to 2.9 per cent. of their turnover.  Milk distributors in 1950 made profits of 4.3 per cent. of their turnover.  It fell to 3.6 per cent. in 1952.  The whole food group of retail traders made profits equivalent to 3.2 per cent. of their turnover in 1950, and that fell to 2.9 per cent. of their turnover in 1952.</P>

      <P>Yes, I can.  I cannot give it for 1950.  The total turnover for all retail traders in 1951 was £46,500,000, and in 1952 was £44,500,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figure here for 1950.  Traders dealing in clothing made profits in 1950 representing 5 per cent. of their turnover, and that had fallen to 3.1 per cent. in 1952.  Other traders in miscellaneous goods made profits representing 5.2 per cent. of the value of their turnover in 1950, which had fallen to 4.1 per cent. in 1952.  I can give similar figures for manufacturers, but I know that Deputies, having in mind the circumstances of 1952, would not be surprised to hear that manufacturers made lower profits in that year than they did in 1950.  The fact is, however, that in the year 1952 many groups of manufacturers made profits which were altogether too low, profits which were disturbingly low because they held out prospects of future difficulties for these manufacturers.  Certainly, in practically every case, the profits made in 1952 were lower than the profits made in 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not proud of these figures.  I do not want Deputies to understand that I think they represent a satisfactory position in this country.  I produce them to answer Deputy <Col N="1740" /> Norton's argument.  Deputy Norton contended that by reason of defective price control, traders and manufacturers are making more profits now than they were allowed to make when the Coalition Government was in office.  The fact is they are making less profits now, and I think it is important for the future of industrial development that manufacturers as a whole should do better in 1953 than they did in 1952.  If they do not do better, certainly, the prospects of promoting expansion of industrial activity through private enterprise will be considerably reduced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the cost of living here was the highest ever.  That is true.  Of course, it is true of every country.  It was giving a very false picture to say that and no more.  The cost of living was the highest ever but wage rates are also higher than they ever were before. The average wage paid in 1953 was 14s. per week higher than in 1951, according to the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not misunderstand what I am trying to do. I am trying to deal with the false propaganda, delivered from the benches opposite and designed to misrepresent the national position, by putting it right, by putting the facts first. Later I will tell the Deputy the conclusions I draw from the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Cosgrave says that the cost of living was higher than it was ever before, that is true but it is not <Col N="1741" /> the whole truth.  The truth is that wage rates are higher than they were ever before.  The truth is that the value of agricultural output is far higher than ever before.  Net agricultural output in 1952, according to the <i>Statistical Survey,</i> was £21,000,000 higher than it was in 1950.  The national income was higher than it was ever before.  In 1952 it was £71,000,000 higher than it was in 1950.  The level of investment was higher than it was ever before. The value of money has altered and it is completely misleading to describe the national position as affected by a higher cost of living than ever existed before and not to recognise that the same causes that pushed up the cost of living have pushed up values in every other operation carried on in the national economy which is calculated in terms of money.</P>
    <P>It is true that many of our farm prices are higher than world level.  We are guaranteeing to our farmers now a price for wheat which works out at £6 per ton on a dry wheat basis higher than the world price.  What the future of the world price may be is a matter upon which experts are debating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>And the consumer is paying for that in the price of flour and bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer is not paying for that, but the taxpayer is through the subsidy.  We put up the price of milk last year to 1/6 per gallon.  We permitted an increase in the price of butter and milk.  We could bring down the price of milk again. Am I to understand from some of the speeches delivered by Deputies opposite that that is what is intended? I know that Deputy Costello said that he dissolved the Dáil in 1951 rather than give in to the blackmail that was being exercised upon him to increase the price of milk, but is that the present policy of the Party opposite? Will they now say that they think the price of butter or milk should be brought down by reducing the return to the producer?  I do not think they will.  There was not one Deputy in the course of this debate who attempted to suggest that the solution <Col N="1742" /> of our cost of living problem might be found in that way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that that was the complaint.  Mind you, there might be something to be said for the argument occasionally advanced by Fine Gael spokesmen that New Zealand butter should be sold at the price it cost to buy so that the public might understand fully the difference between the price we are paying to the Irish farmer for milk to make butter and the price at which butter can be purchased abroad.  But we thought it would be far better in the national interest that there should not be two classes of butter at two different prices available, and that the additional profit that was made by the sale of New Zealand butter should be used to offset the cost of storing Irish butter. That is the way it was used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite an easy matter for some Deputies opposite to compare the movement of the cost of living in this country with the movement in other countries by taking some arbitrary date and calculating the change from that date.  It is quite true, as the O.E.E.C. report pointed out, that in the first six months of this year the cost of living was higher than in the first six months of last year.  We all know it was.  The effect on prices caused by the reduction of subsidies came into operation in the middle of last year.  But to contrast that result with the position in other countries is misleading unless all the facts relating to those other countries are also known.  Most countries subsidised foods to some extent or another during the war and most of them withdrew them before we did, so that the alteration in the cost of living in those countries just began a bit earlier.  I could produce a quite different picture by choosing some other date upon which to base a calculation.  In fact, <Col N="1743" /> however, all the O.E.E.C. price statistics for European countries are based on 1948.  1948 is the basic year, and if we contrast the change in the cost of living which has taken place here since 1948 with the change in all other countries we will find we were about average.  In ten European countries the cost of living rose by more than it rose here; in nine countries it rose by less; so that we have not got the grievance which some Deputies opposite appear to want to exploit.</P>
    <P>Arising out of a remark made last week by Deputy Kyne, might I remind the Labour Party of the fact that the whole saving to the Exchequer effected by the reduction in the food subsidies was devoted to increasing social welfare payments.  Deputy Kyne said that he would never support a Government unless it was prepared to restore the combined level of social welfare and food subsidy payments to the point at which they stood when the Coalition Government left office. That has been done.  The cost of the increase in social welfare payments, which came into operation since this Government came into office, exceeds £7,000,000 per year, and that is more than was saved to the Exchequer by the alteration in food subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that is so or not; but the effect of this change is this, that £7,000,000 which was paid out of the taxpayers' money, the benefit of which formerly went indiscriminately to the wealthiest as well as the poorest in the country, to all people, whether they needed it or not, is now being concentrated upon those sections of our community that need help from the Exchequer most, and we think that that was a good change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, as one of his constructive suggestions, made some irrelevant and completely misleading remarks about tea.  It is untrue that if we were to permit our tea wholesalers to buy their tea supplies now from the London market instead of through the central importing organisation which is operating here they would get it <Col N="1744" /> cheaper.  The last time I examined the position, I found that the lowest priced tea available through Tea Importers, Limited, was lower than the lowest price tea available in the London market.  He said that I have a bee in my bonnet about this because the British Government let us down regarding tea supplies during the war and that I am getting my own back now.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that they let us down, that they broke their solemn pledge to us in regard to tea supplies during the war, but my grievance is not with the British Government; it is with those tea wholesalers in London who had the monopoly of this market and would not raise their fingers or lift their voices with the British Government to secure a more reasonable allocation of the available supplies to this country during that period.  I said then in the Dáil and on the radio that when the war was over, if I had any influence on Government policy here, I would establish an arrangement which would mean that we would draw all our tea supplies from the country of origin and cut out the British middleman.  I think that is good policy now.  It is good policy because it means that the reserve stocks, which we should have had before the war but which were then in London, will in future be held in this country.  The normal trading stocks which the wholesalers and retailers must hold to meet their commitments will be available here in another emergency to strengthen our supply position.  It surely must be possible for us to buy tea direct from India and import it into this country at a lower price than if we pay a British middleman commission for doing it for us.  I do not believe that it is possible for tea to be brought through London cheaper than we can buy it direct.  It is contrary to common sense, and I am hoping that when the permanent arrangements for tea importation into this country are in operation that will be demonstrated beyond all question of doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be legislation to deal with this matter.  On my Estimate I told the Dáil that I had hoped that a new arrangement, which would restore freedom to private traders, would be in operation this year but I found that it was not possible to put it in operation this year, and at the request of the trade it was decided to postpone its operation until the opening of the next buying season.  The form of the legislation which will be required is at present being discussed with all the interests concerned.  I will bring that legislation here and Deputies will have a full opportunity of expressing their views on its merits.  It will be devised to give the maximum freedom to individual traders to operate in a normal way, while at the same time giving effect to the Government policy of ensuring that supplies are bought direct from the country in which they are produced without the intervention of foreign middlemen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick said that as a result of the Government's policy the level of consumption has fallen.  It is quite true that various statistics suggest that the people of this country bought less consumer goods in 1952 than in 1951&mdash;very slightly less.  There was a general process of stocking up in 1951 which operated amongst private people as well as among traders, and there was a counter process of de-stocking in 1952, so that the statistics for the two years are not strictly comparable; but if Deputy Blowick was trying to suggest that people bought less because they could not afford to pay for more goods, the statistics prove him to be completely wrong, because side by side with that slight fall in the level of domestic purchases there was a very considerable increase in the level of personal savings. According to the <i>Statistical Survey</i> which Deputies can study for themselves personal savings in 1952 rose to £30,000,000 whereas in 1951 it was estimated that there was actually a dissaving.</P>

      <P>Let me turn now from the question of the cost of living to that of unemployment and consider some of the statements made regarding unemployment during the course of this debate.  I often wonder if the Deputies opposite believe, themselves, some of the statements they make, much less hope to get other people to believe them.  Deputy Blowick, a former member of the Coalition Government, said here that no time during that Government's period of office did the number of registered unemployed rise beyond 30,000.  I read it in the Official Report of the debate. I was not quite sure, when I was listening to Deputy Blowick, if I heard the figure correctly but that is the figure which appears in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In the first year in which the Coalition Government were in office, the average weekly number of registered unemployed was 61,157.  Deputy Blowick said that at no time during the term of office of the Coalition Government did the number of registered unemployed rise beyond 30,000.  The average weekly number of registered unemployed in the first year of that Government's term of office was 61,157.  The highest figure reached during that year was 80,667.</P>

At no time during the whole of the period of office of the Coalition Government did the number of registered unemployed fall to 30,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said here that the Coalition Government had to bring workers back from abroad in order to enable work to be done.  He said that there was a scarcity of workers.  Some peculiar scenes must have been witnessed at the ports during that period because the average number of emigrants per year while the Coalition Government were in office was well over 30,000.</P>

      <P>There is another factor which Opposition Deputies are inclined to leave out of account.  It is convenient for them that the unemployment statistics for this year are not comparble with those of previous years.  They ignore the fact that a new Social Welfare Act has been passed.  That new Social Welfare Act considerably extended the scope of the unemployment assistance scheme.  It brought on to the unemployment assistance register a number of persons who would not have been on it if that Act had not been passed.  The number of additional names on the register, consequent upon the passing of that Act, varied, according to the Central Statistics Office, from something over 10,000 in May last to 5,500 odd in October.  If we make allowance for that factor, we have to record that during most of the past summer the number of unemployed was less than <Col N="1748" /> during the previous summer.  As every Deputy who studies the figures knows, there was a steady improvement during the summer months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have always argued here that our unemployment problem is serious, and I have never attempted to minimise its dimensions.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce in the past, I took measures at various times to ensure that we had accurate statistics on unemployment so that we would know exactly the size of the task facing us.  The practice of publishing weekly unemployment statistics was begun by me as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is being continued by me now.  I have objected to the magnitude of the problem being exaggerated; I would equally object to its being minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to deal properly with the problems of this country, we must know them exactly as they are.  I admit that unemployment is the biggest problem of all.  This Government are prepared to take, as a test of the soundness of their policy, its effect on employment. If we put more people in employment, create more jobs, then the Government's policy is successful.  If there is not that result, then its policy is a <Col N="1749" /> failure.  We will accept that test and will stand by the results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent most strongly the suggestion that workers employed on road improvements are on relief work.  Twenty-three thousand workers are employed on road operations at the present time, and they are doing a job which I think is essential to the development of the country.  Their work will not merely save lives: it will save costs and it will increase the over-all efficiency of the national organisation. My view is that we are not doing nearly enough to improve the highways of the country.  I have urged that, in addition to the new income to the Road Fund, secured by the adjustment of the motor vehicle duties last year, there should be put into it a proportion of the National Development Fund which is to be set up by legislation before the House.  I think that is good work, work which is worth doing.  I am sure that those who are engaged on it, and all who appreciate its importance will resent Deputy Dillon's contemptuous reference to the workers employed upon the Naas Road scheme or any other road improvement project of that kind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that we are substituting relief work on the Naas Road scheme and the Dublin Castle project for house building and land improvement. There is being spent on land improvement at the present time, and there are employed on land improvement at the present time, five times the amount of money and five times the number of persons as were employed when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture and administering the scheme.  That does not suggest that anything has been substituted for it. May I say, in regard to the Dublin Castle project or any other project for the construction of public buildings, that not one penny, not one brick and not one worker will go into these public building projects which is or who is required for the building of houses either by local authorities or private contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> It is nonsense to talk as if we were still in the war period with limited supplies of timber, limited supplies of cement or limited supplies of other building materials.  There is no scarcity of these materials now and, unfortunately, there is no scarcity of labour either.  The more workers we can employ, using available supplies of building materials, on construction operations of all kinds, the better for the community.  We can proceed with the rehousing programme, which Fianna Fáil initiated, simultaneously with the construction of necessary public buildings.  No public building programme will diminish by one house per year the result of the building drive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick says that the Government are controlled by the Central Bank.  Deputy Dillon read an extract from the most recent report of the Central Bank and commended it to the Government.  It is very difficult to know the common line of policy between Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick.  Deputy Norton tells me not to read that report.  He made special reference to the extract which Deputy Dillon quoted in order to express his disagreement with it.  If ever and whenever Deputy Norton and Deputy Dillon get into the same Government again, I hope that it will be Deputy Norton's view that will prevail and that, when that time comes, it will be Deputy Norton who will be able to talk about Deputy Dillon as being &ldquo;as quiet as a mouse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government has no responsibility of any kind, and never had responsibility, for the views expressed in its annual report by the Central Bank Board.  The Act setting up that board makes it quite clear that it has the obligation of expressing its comments on the management of the public finances, but the Government is not bound to have regard to its views in the application of its own policy, if it does not agree with them.  It certainly is a useful thing to have an authoritative body in a position to express an independent view upon these important public questions and to point out the possible dangers associated with any course of action the Government <Col N="1751" /> may follow.  No country is the worse for having an independent view of that kind expressed, but the fact that the Central Bank expresses that view in no way commits the Government to following it or to agreeing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We had here the expression of a most extraordinary opinion from the spokesman of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Declan Costello. He was put up to lead this debate and I presume he was speaking with the authority of his Party.  It was quite obviously a carefully prepared speech he delivered and the views in it must be assumed to conform with Party policy.  He told us that the important thing was to repatriate our external assets in any way possible and that they should be brought back even in the form of consumer goods.  He said he favoured repatriation of external assets by deliberate planned deficits in trade.  I think that is the policy of a madhouse.  Apparently, the Fine Gael Party regard the possession of external reserves as something to be ashamed of, as some handicap to be got rid of as quickly as possible.  Most other countries in the world would regard them as an essential bulwark of their economic independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is obviously no sense in keeping abroad financial resources which could be more profitably employed at <Col N="1752" /> home, and, in case that observation of mine is misunderstood, may I make it clear that, in using the expression &ldquo;profitably employed at home&rdquo;, I do not confine their use to purposes which are profitable in the financial sense.  I disagree with the view implied in the Central Bank Report that external assets should be repatriated for utilisation here only if they can earn more money here than they are at present earning abroad.  We could be satisfied with a much smaller financial return if the general economic or social consequences were sufficient to justify the change, but the aim of the Government is to induce people to bring back for use in this country any external funds they may control for the purpose of their productive investment here. We do not propose, as I think Deputy Costello suggested his Party might do, to confiscate or conscript these resources of private persons, at least not until it is clear that it is a life and death matter for the country.  During the whole period I have been Minister for Industry and Commerce, I can say that no worth-while development of any kind, whether planned by a Government Department or some private group of people, ever failed to materialise because of inability to get the capital to finance it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That worn-out argument will not stand the light of day. We had to pay a big price for the money you are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of investment, whether on public or private account, is far higher now than it ever was under the Coalition Government. There was not a single project for capital investment started by the Coalition Government.  Every form of investment they undertook was under the authority of an Act framed and passed through the Dáil at the instance of the previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to Deputy Costello's point, I want to make it quite clear <Col N="1753" /> that we do not propose to encourage the use of these external reserves to finance the importation of consumer goods, goods we are quite capable of making for ourselves.  It is a good thing that Deputy Costello realises, and that others of his Party are beginning to realise, when they talk of repatriation of external assets that the only form in which they can come in is in the form of goods.  As I said before, they have to visualise the process of repatriation in the form of ships coming into port and dockers going aboard and taking off goods for landing here.</P>
    <P>We repatriated these external assets to the extent of a considerable sum of money when 4,000,000 square yards of worsted cloth were imported in 1951, but the effect of that repatriation of external assets was to put thousands of workers here out of their jobs for a year.  We ended that type of repatriation.  It is a good thing, however, that this keener realisation of the significance of what they are talking about is beginning to come to the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party, and that they now can talk about repatriation of external assets in a form that people can understand.</P>
    <P>The importation of consumer goods, the bringing in of imported products we could make for ourselves, the putting out of their employment of Irish workers now engaged in the production of these products, is a policy we do not believe in and will vigorously oppose in office or out of it.  Let Deputies remember that it is not a disadvantage to have external assets.  It is a very considerable advantage.</P>
    <P>Other countries are making substantial sacrifices at present in order to get into the position we are in, of having external reserves to call upon in times of difficulty.  If the terms of trade should turn to our disadvantage, or if the policies of other Governments should make it impossible for us to expand our exports in sufficient degree, it will be a good thing to have these reserves of foreign currency with which to finance imports of essential materials required to keep the level of industrial activity going in this country.  If we can, by utilising them, <Col N="1754" /> secure release from the necessity for imports by expanding production here, it will be something worth doing and something the doing of which we will encourage; but to dissipate these external assets, merely to get rid of them, on the importation of goods we do not need to import because we can produce them for ourselves, would be, as I have said, a policy fit for a madhouse.</P>
    <P>Many matters were raised in the course of the debate which I am not in a position to deal with, including references to administrative details concerning the Department of Agriculture or Local Government.  Deputies who want to talk about these matters will have other opportunities, and, so far as local government is concerned, they will have the opportunity in the very near future because the Estimate is ordered for debate.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one which gives the Government certain powers they need to retain for the present to carry on certain important activities, including control of prices, regulation of imports, operation of currency control and other functions of that kind.  It is intended to be the last Bill of its kind.  By the time the Bill will be due for renewal, every Department will have brought to the Dáil proposals for legislation to give it such powers as it permanently requires.  We think it undesirable that these very wide powers which some Deputies criticised should be available to the Government in normal times. We are proposing, therefore, to shed them, to get rid of them, but we cannot get rid of them until, in some cases permanent legislation gives the continuing powers we require.  That is why we are asking the Dáil to pass the Bill for a further period of 15 months, on our assurance that they will not be asked to renew it at the end of that period.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £169,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have observed from the published Book of Estimates that the Wireless Broadcasting Estimate is presented this year in a form considerably different from what it was last year and in previous years.  Before I deal with the amount provided in it, I should like to give the House the reasons for the change in the form. In speaking on a Supplementary Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting in November, 1952, I explained that a fundamental change was being made in the broadcasting organisation from the 1st January, 1953, by the appointment of a comhairle of five persons who would advise the Minister and take the executive responsibility for broadcasting that had been exercised up to then by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I found that all Parties in the House were enthusiastic about removing broadcasting from the position of a sub-Department of the Post Office operated on strictly Civil Service lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only criticism that was made was that we were not going far enough, and that it would be better to establish an independent corporation on the lines of the B.B.C.  The Government did not favour making such a drastic change, at least in one step, but I was gratified that the House was so fully on my side in my proposal to get away from the type of control of broadcasting and operation that had been in existence here since 1926.  I stated also then that, as part of the reorganisation, I <Col N="1756" /> proposed, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the Government, to simplify broadcasting financial procedure, and I indicated that with that object in view consideration was being given to the form of the Estimate to bring it more in line with the kind of financial statement put before Parliaments in countries where broadcasting was operated by statutory corporations.  That is the reason for reducing the number of sub-heads from 11 to three and omitting many of the details that had hitherto been given.</P>
    <P>Control of the expenditure has not been lessened in any way by reason of the new format, and auditors and the Public Accounts Committee can exercise the closest check on every item of broadcasting expenditure.  Not a penny can be spent unless it is strictly on the business of broadcasting within the ambit of the legislation which governs the establishment and running of the service.  I should mention that the Public Accounts Committee was consulted in regard to the new form of the Estimate, as we wished to be very careful that it would have the approval of the committee on behalf of the Dáil.  Having regard to the enthusiasm expressed in the House in November last for an independent type of broadcasting organisation, I have no doubt that Deputies will fully approve of the simplification of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Concurrently with the change in the form of the Estimate the Minister for Finance gave the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wide general sanctions in regard to broadcasting expenditure without prescribing overriding limits in various categories except as regards staff.  The Minister for Finance has certain legal responsibilities in regard to Civil Service staffing, but here again he has allowed as much latitude to broadcasting as his statutory liabilities permit.</P>
    <P>Under the new reorganisation the comhairle will know in advance the order of the sum it will have at its disposal for some time to come.  This was a most desirable innovation.  The arrangement approved by the Government is that for its day-to-day operations the broadcasting service will get an amount equal to the total of the <Col N="1757" /> licence and sponsored programme receipts.  The receipts estimated from these two sources for 1953-54 are £429,000 as will be seen from the second page of the Estimate.  The sum it is proposed to provide, under the &ldquo;Expenses of Broadcasting&rdquo; is £432,000.  The difference of £3,000 between the two sums represents the cost of some staff engaged on the administrative work of broadcasting in the secretary's office of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who were transfered to Radio Éireann from the 1st January, 1953, as a first step in the amalgamation of the broadcasting organisation into a single unit.</P>
    <P>The licence and sponsored programme fees will not cover the cost of any large equipment required in the way of engineering apparatus or musical instruments, and the provision for equipment will continue in effect to be a subsidy.  The subsidy is shown under sub-head B.  It amounts this year to £145,000.  This exceptionally large sum is due to the inclusion of the cost of three transmitters&mdash;one to replace the powerful 100 Kw. transmitter at Athlone, which is now absolete, and two to replace the worn-out transmitters at Dublin and Cork.  The transmitters account for £115,000 of the total sum.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sum provided in the Broadcasting Vote itself, a number of other Departments have always done work for broadcasting and have borne the cost on their own Votes.  A list of these Departments, with the amounts they estimate to expend on broadcasting work during the current year, is shown on page two of the Estimate. This expenditure will also continue to be provided, as in the past, as a subsidy for broadcasting.  The Department which incurs the largest expenditure under this heading is, of course, the Post Office, which collects the licence fees throughout the country at the post offices and carries out inspections in connection with the taking out of the licences.  The cost of buildings and reconstruction will continue to be borne on the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.</P>
    <P>The salaries of the comhairle and of the principal officers of the broadcasting <Col N="1758" /> station are shown in Part III of the Estimate, but the cost of the other staff is shown in a bulk sum.</P>
    <P>Before I report further on progress, may I report again the objectives we seek in Radio Éireann so difficult to achieve in a single programme?</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of Radio Éireann is to provide entertainment in an Irish setting to suit every taste to be found in our community; from our own and foreign dance music to classical compositions; from Irish and universal variety shows to debates in Irish and English on Irish and universal themes; from traditional music and songs from the four provinces of Ireland in Irish and English to operas and songs in every language from abroad.</P>
    <P>As in the case of all good broadcasting institutions abroad, the programme is weighted to provide palatable, cultural entertainment, with an emphasis on our own creative and traditional culture and possibly of a somewhat higher standard than we would expect to be asked for by purely &ldquo;popular&rdquo; demand.  As I said before I know that light music would head the list here as in other places in the collated results of any listener research investigation.</P>
    <P>The object of any good radio service should be to intermingle light programmes with more serious items requiring a greater degree of concentration in such a manner that, at least a good proportion of listeners will leave the radio on before the lighter item commences and after it terminates and can, we hope, be induced to enjoy a varied programme.  The quality of the more serious items must be of the very highest to achieve this result.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested in hearing something about the programme developments that have taken place since January 1st.  In a broadcasting station big changes are not made every day and every month.</P>
    <P>Improvement is brought about more gradually by numerous small changes and by persistent attention to the raising of the quality of the programmes. Under the comhairle, however, a number of fairly important changes have been carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> One of the first things the comhairle authorised was the addition of some expert staff for the better handling of programmes where there was a severe lack of such qualified manpower.  A talks producer, sports officer, head of scriptwriters, a second assistant music director and extra news staff have been employed.  We have also more recently added an assistant conductor and a new full-time choir of ten singers.  For the better technical balance of the output from the studios, a number of balance and control officers have been engaged.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the desire of the Government, the comhairle has also tackled the amalgamation of broadcasting in a single administrative unit.  The administrative, accounting and other work was, until the reorganisation was brought into effect, carried out in the various branches of the Post Office.  Completely new administrative and accounting sections have now been set up in the broadcasting station.  The question of the integration and transfer to station control of the engineering personnel, which is still, and always has been, under the control of the Post Office engineer-in-chief, is at present being examined.  There has been a reorganisation of some of the programme departments within the station so that programmes in English and Irish can be prepared to greater advantage.</P>
    <P>The House may now be interested if I refer briefly to a number of programme developments, some of them small and others more substantial, but all of which have, I believe, tended to raise quality and to give better finish to the Radio Éireann output.</P>
    <P>As regards the news, a small change that will, I am sure, remove irritation, is that the bulletins now begin and end at even times, that is, at the hours, half-hours or quarter-hours&mdash;all the other programmes of a more or less permanent nature are also started at regular times and on fixed days of the week.  Announcements of examinations and such matters have been cut out of the time devoted to the news.  It is generally recognised that it is good <Col N="1760" /> radio practice that news bulletins should not be long&mdash;not more than a quarter of an hour&mdash;but the time should be devoted to news and not to all sorts of small notifications.</P>
    <P>These are provided for in a separate ten minutes period every day.  Brief items of local news from all over the country have been introduced into the bulletins and a large organisation of local correspondents has been built up to supply these items.  Topical talks are given after the 1.30 p.m. bulletin. Detailed weather forecasts for farmers and fishermen, which have often been asked for in the House, are now broadcast.  Prices are also reported for the Dublin fish market in the same way as the cattle market prices have been given for a long time.</P>
    <P>Last year a special feature was introduced to cover the week in the Oireachtas, which has now been followed up by a nightly report at 11 p.m. on each night on which the Dáil sits.  This is in the hands of capable journalists who have been brought on to the staff of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>In talks and discussion programmes, teams have continued to discuss a wide variety of matter of current interest. I am glad to say that these virile arguments on subjects which are for the most part controversial are now accepted as it was intended they should be&mdash;not as Government pronouncements from a State broadcasting station, but as the free expression of opinion by persons selected solely for their competence to bring out the points for and against proposals that are of general and sometimes vital interest to the public.  In the discussions criticism is often made of State Departments, of some sections of the community, and of the Government itself.  Such criticism, I am glad to say, is generally accepted as reflecting the many points of view that exist on matters that affect the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Budget this year, talks were broadcast by the Minister for Finance and the representatives of the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party.  We would have liked to be able to include talks by representatives <Col N="1761" /> of the other Parties but from the point of view of broadcasting interest the number had to be limited. Probably next year it might be possible by arrangements among the Parties to give an opportunity to the small Parties to have their voices heard.  A series of talks by representatives of the Parties at a suitable time of the year would be of great interest for listeners; so would a number of talks immediately before a general election.  The broadcasting authorities would be pleased to give facilities to the Parties for such series of talks if there is general support among the Parties for them.</P>
    <P>We have recently had series of talks on world affairs, both in English and in Irish, by well-known speakers competent in their subject, and these are continuing.  We have planned also a comprehensive series of lectures reflecting the best in contemporary Irish scholarship.  This series, entitled the Thomas Davis lectures, began in September with six talks on early Irish society, given by Dr. Myles Dillon and other experts from the Institute of Advanced Studies.  &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; the old favourite, is back again, with many additions to test the knowledge of young and old.  A new weekly programme, &ldquo;What's on your Mind?&rdquo;  is touring the country bringing discussions by local speakers and local audiences of whatever topics they care to raise.  It recently had a session in London.</P>
    <P>Talks in Irish are now given before broadcasts of big matches&mdash;Gaelic football, Hurling, Rugby football, and Soccer.  A new magazine programme for women, &ldquo;Between Ourselves&rdquo; and a new magazine programme for country listeners, &ldquo;Country Journal,&rdquo; are being broadcast weekly.  Variety programmes such as &ldquo;Beginners Please&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Real Blarney&rdquo; have come from Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  In recognition of the popular taste for Irish dance music, a new one-hour céilí programme of music, story and song has been started under the title &ldquo;Take the Floor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the drama side arrangements were made to bring guest producers <Col N="1762" /> and actors from abroad and some of them have already come and done work for us.  For example we had Mr. Peter Watts, B.B.C. producer to direct three plays in July.  The casts included well-known British radio stars, as well as Hilton Edwards and Ronald Ibbs. Denis Johnston, the distinguished Irish writer now working in America, produced a new version of &ldquo;The Dreaming Dust&rdquo;, his play about Dean Swift, in August.  W.R. Rodgers, the Ulster poet who is well known in radio through his work with the B.B.C., is writing a programme for production this year.  Siobhán McKenna has broadcast for us in her own version of St. Joan in Irish and is to perform it also in English.  The Arts Theatre, Belfast, has also done a production for Radio Éireann.  Competitions for drama have been held and the writing of original radio plays is having notable success.  A number of other developments on the drama side have been planned.</P>
    <P>I shall now make a short reference to the music side of the station's activities.  As before, the Symphony Orchestra has given twice weekly concerts in the Phoenix Hall under guest conductors and with soloists from home and abroad and the orchestra has also taken part in operatic and other productions in conjunction with outside societies.  The most notable venture in which the Radio Éireann Orchestra co-operated was in the season of the Dublin Grand Opera Society which brought to Dublin the Munich State Opera and an Italian company of singers.  The orchestra has also continued the practice of giving provincial concerts.  Because of its increasing commitments and of the primary duty of providing symphony music from the studios for the listeners it will probably be necessary to tighten up the arrangements for the visits of the orchestra to the country.</P>
    <P>What the director has in mind is that instead of having concerts fixed in a haphazard way as applications are received from local musical societies the orchestra will be made available for a tour of perhaps a fortnight at a time to be selected by the broadcasting authorities.  Opportunity <Col N="1763" /> will be given to the local bodies as far as practicable to have concerts in their towns included in the tour.  This will also apply to the light orchestra.</P>
    <P>As I announced recently, Mr. Milan Horvat has been engaged for a three year's period as conductor of the orchestra.  I look forward with great hope to the work Mr. Horvat will do here in the building up of the orchestra to enable it to take its place as a combination of international standard.  As I mentioned earlier, we have also appointed a young Irish assistant conductor, Mr. Eimear Ó Broin.  After taking his music degree in university college and attending the summer school of music held here under the auspices of the Department of Education, Mr. Ó Broin studied in the Paris Conservatoire where last year he won first place in the final examination in orchestral conducting in the foreign section.  This competition was open to young conductors from all over the world and it was a high distinction for an Irishman to gain the premier award.  Mr. Ó Broin subsequently studied the conducting of opera and ballet at the Munich State Opera.  I am sure he will derive further great benefit from working under Milan Horvat here.</P>
    <P>In connection with the symphony orchestra I wish to refer to the series of promenade concerts held in the Gaiety in the spring of this year, and the autumn series being given at present.  We have audiences in Dublin for the more serious types of works by the masters but there is a still larger demand for works which are somewhat lighter.  It was to satisfy that demand that the proms were arranged.  They have been a huge success and every concert was played to a full house.  By the way, prom is, of course, a borrowed title.  If Deputies, or their friends, could give us a native title, preferably an Irish title, which would convey the meaning of the proms to the imagination, we would be grateful.  We have been unable to find a title that would preserve the idea.</P>
    <P>The light orchestra, under its conductor, Dermot O'Hara, is, I know, a <Col N="1764" /> most popular music combination.  A special tribute was paid to it here by Deputy Corish on the occasion of the Supplementary Broadcasting Estimate. The orchestra continues to give concerts from the studio of light classical music, Irish dance music and Irish folk music, and it provides music for variety programmes.  As in last year, it has given concerts throughout the country and these have generally been well attended.  Lunch-time concerts of Irish music have been performed by the light orchestra for half an hour each Sunday from 1.0 to 1.30.</P>
    <P>In connection with the performances of Irish music, I would like to mention specially the question of arrangements. It used to be said that all the Irish music that had been orchestrated could be play in half an hour.  That was probably a slight exaggeration, but it is undoubtedly the case that there is a sad deficiency in the amount of such music available to keep the programmes of the light orchestra going throughout the year without monotonous repetition.  Orchestration of Irish music calls for considerable skill and artistry.  In addition to musical competence, the arranger needs to have the tradition of Irish music in his blood.  There are a few outstanding exceptions of persons outside Ireland who can arrange Irish music, or perhaps the music of any nation, but as a general rule the arrangements could be done better by an Irishman if he had the requisite skill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the position about arrangements has improved very considerably recently.  A number of Irish musicians, including Réamonn Friel, A.J. Potter, Walter Beckett and Éamonn Ó Gallchobhair, are devoting a good deal of time to making arrangements for the orchestra, and quite a number of orchestrations have been made since the 1st January, of dance music, traditional airs for orchestra and soloist and for orchestra and choir.  An immense amount of arrangement work remains to be done. It is a work that will be of lasting benefit to broadcasting and to our native music, and we are prepared to spend much more money on it than we have been spending.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> Finance need not be a difficulty in connection with this important contribution to Irish music.  The problem is that there are too few persons capable of doing the work and that those who are doing it have not as much time to spare for it as we, and they, would like.  I should like to express my thanks to the authorities of the Folklore Commission for offering to place the large amount of music material held by the commission at the disposal of broadcasting for the purpose of orchestration.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned briefly earlier, we have established a full-time choir of ten voices.  We have had a part-time choir of 24 persons for some years. They have done excellent work, but it is more satisfactory to have a group who can devote their whole time to broadcasting.  A Radio Éireann Choral Society of approximately 80 voices has also been formed.  This large group will give two or three concerts with the symphony orchestra each year.  I should like to pay a tribute here to the diligence and enthusiasm which I understand this voluntary society is bringing to its choral work.  It requires persistence and interest to a high degree for people who are working all day to carry out long rehearsals in the evening.  I wish the choral society every success.</P>
    <P>I must speak of developments in connection with the orchestras.  As I have already told the House, a permanent conductor and an assistant Irish conductor have been appointed.  I need not expatiate on their qualities. It will be sufficient to say that the principal conductor has been invited to conduct the London and Paris Symphony Orchestras and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra while the Irish assistant conductor has just returned from guest conducting in Scandinavia. Wherever he went, Irish music was played and in Oslo the broadcasting station received messages from listeners asking for more Irish music.  I hope that the conductors will introduce Irish music on a scale never before possible whenever they fulfil occasional foreign engagements.</P>
    <P>Last year there was considerable discussion about the provision of orchestral <Col N="1766" /> players.  In a small country such as this the Radio Éireann orchestras must inevitably set the whole standard of instrumental music in the country and the two orchestras become the national orchestras for Ireland&mdash;the 32 Counties.</P>
    <P>In our music development we are relatively where England was in 1920, and of this we need not be ashamed because of very tardy but definite progress now evident on all sides.  The future of this country depends so much on the abandonment of the avoidably mediocre in our national life that for our own advancement high standards must be set in every sphere to which we may aspire.  In respect of Irish and symphonic music both for enhancing our cultural heritage and for the advancement of the tourist industry the variety and quality of Radio Éireann performances must enormously improve since broadcasting affects all music.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the future of Ar Tóstal and all Irish festivals depends on being able to offer the outside world an international forum for music and drama in which we provide exemplary entertainment and that we must build a concert hall and assembly rooms as a matter of vital national cold-blooded commercial interest as well as for the entertainment and culture of our own people.  I understand that considerable progress may have been made in regard to this essential aspect of our civilisation.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Orchestral Players, I trust, will continue to encourage some of their enthusiastic amateur players to acquire concert standard.  Let me repeat, in Irish Boston, 160,000 tickets are bought every year for the popular classical concerts in a period of three months.  In terms of greater Dublin, 50,000 people should attend concerts here apart from tourists if we are to enjoy music in proportionate degree. That is the target for our achievement, and Radio Éireann will inevitably play the major part in this development.</P>
    <P>May I also observe that the crowds who come to the proms are in the majority ordinary people, not highbrows, and it is well for us to realise that symphony and operatic music are <Col N="1767" /> becoming popular in the way they have always been in Germany, France and Italy.  They are enjoyed by the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The director of music and the new conductor have been assessing the general position of both orchestras, while I have conferred with the examiners at Dublin Feiseanna of recent years, where the prize-winning standard is not, naturally, up to concert orchestra pitch, save very exceptionally. Finally, an audition has been held for all classes of instruments at which candidates were appointed, or told to continue their studies or informed that their standard was too much below the orchestras requirements to be given any special advice. The result of all these inquiries is that the director of music and the conductor can have the responsibility for bringing the orchestras to higher levels of performances in the light of the following facts and subject to certain general conditions.</P>
    <P>All Irish players of European concert standard, such as that prescribed by, for example, the Danish radio orchestra, have been offered positions at the annual audition which has taken place, and there will be little chance of a surplus of talent but rather for years a scarcity of players.  Promising players are being encouraged and a student orchestra will be formed.  We can readily absorb all the talent that is likely to come forward in the next few years.  No permanent musician whose standard remains unaltered will be dismissed.  This will alleviate the fears of those who dislike the hardship that comes to players not accustomed to the intense movement taking place in the foreign musical world.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of the orchestra, apart from those appointed as a result of annual auditions, is subject to the following limitations, which are in the nature of a résumé of the available musical talent here.  In the violin class there are bright hopes.  The comhairle will appoint six Irish violinists to the orchestra on a half-time basis while they continue their studies, an innovation unknown in national orchestra <Col N="1768" /> circles in Europe.  There are a few other pupils of promise still at an early stage of instruction.  In regard to the viola and 'cello classes, one viola player has been appointed, one shows promise.  No 'cellist was found.  There is an absolute dearth of these players of concert standard who wish to join the orchestras.  No double bass players offer themselves.  One pupil is studying under one of our musicians.</P>
    <P>In regard to the seven main wind instruments, there are no concert standard instructors for two and for all these seven instruments there are 10 pupils taking concert standard instruction at the Academy of Music of whom six have been awarded scholarships. In fact, this country, in respect of wind instruments, is now in the same position as other countries in the twenties.  As a result, all over Europe wind instrument players are found to be foreign or naturalised in the last twenty years.  The number of pupils is, of course, grossly inadequate. At the audition, it was found possible to appoint one clarinet player.  One of the more famous of our judges at a Feis said to me: &ldquo;I have just completed my work at this Feis.  I have two main impressions. There is plenty of musical talent in Ireland in respect of piano and violin, but very few people are studying wind instruments for playing in a symphony orchestra.  I encourage them all but many of them do not realise the amount of study required to play well in an orchestra, sometimes three years, even five years after reaching the prize winning standard.&rdquo;  It is obvious from speaking with the organisers of Feiseanna that competition is keen for singing, piano and violin.  In respect of all other instruments there are a few aspirants.  In fact, at two recent Dublin Feiseanna only 12 first and second prizes were awarded in respect of 30 prizes offered in the senior, intermediate and open grades for all orchestral instruments, excluding piano and violin.</P>
    <P>Summing up the position, the director of music is encouraging Irish musicians to complete their studies.  He will absorb all the native talent available but will have to have <Col N="1769" /> recourse to foreign players when necessary, a practice now accepted as inevitable in countries such as Switzerland and Sweden.  I hope there will be more musicians capable of giving advanced instruction; and that there will be more opportunities for sending on special occasions first-class musicians to assist and inspire the smaller amateur orchestras in Cork, Galway and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As regards equipment, the largest items are, of course, the new transmitters to which I have already referred.  In addition, broadcasting has, for the first time, got an organ for its own use&mdash;a Campton Electrone.  We are grateful to the churches and cinemas for providing for our organ music up to now.  The acoustics are not, however, in all cases up to broadcasting needs in churches and other buildings and, besides, an organ is needed for broadcasting for other purposes than for full recitals.  The organ is, therefore, a valuable addition to broadcasting facilities.</P>
    <P>Among the smaller items of equipment I might mention that it is proposed to get a very high frequency apparatus which will enable commentaries to be given with facility on sports where the competitors move from place to place&mdash;golf, boat races, etc.  The commentaries can be sent by very short wave radio to a receiving unit for transmission by line to the studio or for recording on the spot. The equipment can also be used for broadcasts from islands or other places from which broadcasts could not otherwise be done.  Wé have also got sets of an ingeniously built small tape recording unit which was recently developed.  The apparatus can easily be carried by a radio reporter, and he can use it anywhere he can go himself &mdash;for instance, for taking interviews in a crowded meeting, or in an aeroplane in flight.</P>
    <P>I have reappointed the broadcasting advisory committee, in accordance with the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, that such a committee should be set up to advise the Minister.  I hope and believe that the work of this honorary committee <Col N="1770" /> will be as valuable to broadcasting as it has been in the past.  The new comhairle is concerned to a considerable extent with the framing of policy and with executive decisions.  The advisory committee will in a broad way represent listeners and will be able to make general recommendations to the Minister on the needs of the various sections of the community.  I have appointed Séamus Ó Braonáin, former director of broadcasting, as chairman of the advisory committee for the next two years' period.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of broadcasting here we have carried out a formal inquiry for the purpose of eliciting the tastes and habits of listeners and finding out when they listen and what they do and what they do not like in radio programmes.  The brunt of the organisation of this inquiry fell on the Director of Statistics, Dr. Geary, and on the staff of the Central Statistics Office; the staffs of the post offices throughout the country carried out the field work.  The inquiry was done with expedition and efficiency and we are most grateful to Dr. Geary and his officials and to the Post Office officials who undertook the work for us.</P>
    <P>The result of this inquiry will not be published for reasons that are obvious. Dramatic producers do not publish figures recording the volume of applause for each member of their casts, nor does a music impresario list the number of tickets sold to people listening to a soprano and a tenor.  But I will say this: The absolutely overwhelming majority of the Irish people with wireless sets listen to Radio Éireann every day in the year, and the percentage enjoying the more serious cultural and educational programmes is not unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>At the same time the inquiry also shows a tremendous interest in light music of American origin coming from abroad.  The moral of the report is Radio Éireann will have to make a supreme effort to popularise and modernise what is Irish if national distinctions are to be preserved.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned in public that one of the aims of Comhairle Radio Éireann and the director was to make <Col N="1771" /> an increase in the total daily broadcasting time.  For some months past the station has been kept open up to 11.15 p.m. on the days the Dáil sat to give a summary of the proceedings. I am glad to say that beginning on November the 1st there has been a permanent opening up to 11.30 p.m. instead of the normal time of 11 p.m. on every night of the week.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I should mention that this is the period which has been placed well at the top of the list in the recent listener inquiry as the particular half-hour extension listeners would prefer. Plans have also been completed to open the station permanently for a continuous period on Sundays from 1 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.  That will be a total extension of three hours on Sunday, from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Since the 2nd August the station has been kept open up to 3 o'clock instead of 2.30 as an instalment of the additional period.</P>
    <P>May I say in connection with television, that I regard television as inevitable in the future, but in view of considerable comment in various circles I would like to make some observations on television in relation to this country.</P>
    <P>Many rumours had been circulated in regard to the prospects for television about which no Government decision had been taken, and I desire to make the following observations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The Government has made no decision as yet on the future of television but its coming is inevitable, like the motor-car.</P>
    <P>2.  The range of foreign television over the Twenty-Six Counties is unlikely to extend in the next few years, so as to by itself compel a decision on home television.</P>
    <P>3.  In England and the United States of America the sale of radio sets remains very high (in the United States of America 10,000,000 radio to 11,000,000 television sets in one year). A demand for sound broadcasting would continue because of family preferences in the home even if television comes.</P>
    <P>4.  Television was the greatest visual <Col N="1772" /> propaganda force for good or evil in the modern world.  Never will I recommend to the Government television that is not absolutely first-class and directed towards the preservation of the national culture as well as for entertainment purposes.  Second-rate television exceeds third-rate films in vulgarity.</P>
    <P>5.  Whatever the organisation set up for television may be, all-Ireland reception will be essential and considerable experimentation will be necessary.</P>
    <P>6.  Whatever the eventual plan for television the cost will be high if the programme is to be first-class.</P>
    <P>7.  Small countries in Europe are still experimenting.  The conventions in regard to an exchange of programmes and provision of first-class telefilms and film records of plays, talks and features for universal use are in a state of flux, present material available being utterly inadequate. The position will probably alter radically in a few years and probably for the better.  The same observations apply to colour television.  Nothing will be gained by hasty decisions.</P>
    <P>8.  If the job is to be well done, a number of years will elapse before the full network could be available.  Ample information and warning will be given by the Government a considerable time in advance of any installation should the heavy subsidies be considered possible and television in general considered desirable.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly to the question of a second programme on the Supplementary Estimate in November last and I indicated that there could possibly be some separate transmissions from Dublin and Cork when the new transmitters had been installed.  The second programme is a matter of some magnitude and complexity and I have nothing further to report to the House at this stage.  I also gave my views to the House in November on the need for an up-to-date radio headquarters and I am leaving the matter at that for the present.  I should say, however, that the recent increase of 5/- in the licence fee provided only for the increase in expenses of broadcasting <Col N="1773" /> that had taken place over a number of years and for such improvements as are taking place at present or are envisaged in the near future.</P>
    <P>I cannot now say how a radio building or a complete second programme would be financed.  If broadcasting itself had to make any contribution to them the new licence fee of 17/6 would not meet the cost.  This is not, however, a matter of immediate consequence for listeners, as these projects will not come to fruition for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>I have now given the Dáil an account of the work of the broadcasting station under its new management.  I am fully satisfied that the bringing of broadcasting to a sort of half-way house between ordinary Civil Service and independent statutory organisation type of operation&mdash;which was obviously in the nature of an experiment&mdash;has proved to be an outstanding success. As Minister, I have found it possible to step out of the broadcasting picture at a much earlier date than I thought possible except, of course, for such matters as the Minister and Government must continue to be responsible, and are responsible for, where broadcasting is carried out by corporations. I now leave the ordinary operations of broadcasting to the comhairle and the director and I do so with every confidence.  We have now few complaints of unfairness or lack of balance in the news, and it seems to be accepted that the broadcasting authorities are giving the news in a disinterested way&mdash;the criterion being the value of the news as general interest for listeners.  In matters such as Dáil questions, Deputies have accepted the spirit of the reorganisation and are not to any large extent insisting on their rights to put questions about matters concerning the day-to-day working of the station.</P>
    <P>People are slow to praise openly any State activity, direct or indirect, but I would be lacking any kind of political and social conscience if I did not record in the annals of this House the great number of messages I have received from all over Ireland recognising the improvement in the programmes.</P>
    <P>Credit must go first to the director <Col N="1774" /> who in a short space of time has justified my faith in his abilities and above all my conviction that he never lost touch with this country and would understand our virtues, prejudices and frailties.</P>
    <P>The comhairle has shown a fine sense of responsibility and as a team clearly understand the more idealistic function of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the staff of broadcasting who have borne the brunt of the work under conditions which were not ideal because of some shortage of personnel and insufficient and not entirely suitable accommodation. I welcome the new members of the staff who have been selected because of their qualifications for the jobs into which they have been put. I am confident they will bring their enthusiasm and ability to bear on the many broadcasting jobs which have to be done in a minimum of time and with a maximum of efficiency and will help their more experienced colleagues in making the machine work with less flurry in the whole organisation and with more pleasure for our listeners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back.  I am doing so as a protest against some of the things that happened in the last 12 months.  While I admit that the Minister has tried to cater for the tastes of listeners in the rural areas, I am satisfied that no matter what changes are made in the personnel of the committee their tastes will be more in keeping with those of a few people in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated on one occasion that he intended to organise an orchestra which would be one of the best in the world.  That is a good thing to have as an ideal, but at the time Ireland, according to the statements of Ministers, was in a state of chaos; We had pawned the country; it was in debt; there was nothing but unemployment. Notwithstanding what was said by spokesmen from the Government side we were going to cater for a very small element in the community whom we could consider as living in luxury.  I refer the Minister to a speech made here by the Taoiseach on one occasion when he stated that if it were a question of providing employment <Col N="1775" /> or providing luxuries, he would make all the sacrifies for the relief of unemployment rather than cater for people living in luxury.</P>
    <P>I protest against the amount of over £500,000 for broadcasting.  What have we got in return?  The Government back benchers one time were denouncing the fact that some foreigners were being employed in Radio Éireann.  They were loud in their protests.  What do we find to-day?  In reply to a question I put down to the Minister recently we find that the number of non-nationals in Radio Éireann has been increasing within the last few months.  There are 22 non-nationals and 40 nationals employed, a lesser number of nationals than previously. I remember well that a different stand was taken previously from that which is taken to-day.  When an English band came to this country on one occasion when there was a dispute affecting the Metropole, there were men who took a chance on having these gentlemen removed and sent back to their own quarters.</P>
    <P>English bands are not such a great attraction in Ireland.  A number of people will flock to hear them on the first few nights but after that they take second place to the Irish bands.  I regret that while we have so many men unemployed we are still employing non-nationals in Radio Éireann.  I received during my term of office the same advice probably as the Minister received, that these non-nationals would be able to teach our Irish boys to be greater musicians; still there was always a demand to employ a few extra, and I refused to employ any more non-nationals while we had Irishmen available.  I am sorry that the Minister gave in to the pressure of employing not alone non-nationals for the orchestra but a man who comes from Czechoslovakia to work for a period of eight months.  I am glad to see that a young Irishman was appointed deputy; I would prefer to see him appointed as chief conductor for the time being and we could wait for some years before we realised the Minister's ideal of having the best symphony orchestra in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> We were told that a poll would be conducted among the people to decide their favourite programmes and what they would like on Radio Éireann.  I made inquiries in my own constituency in this regard and over 80 per cent. of the people whom I consulted voted against the expenditure of £84,000 on symphony concerts.  A great many of them never listened to them.  It is fantastic, when we have 60,000 people unemployed, to spend £84,000 for the benefit of a few old fogies in Rathmines who are living in luxury, especially when we have regard to the fact that 22 of those employed in the orchestra are non-nationals receiving higher allowances than the Irishmen.  If Irishmen are lucky enough to be employed, they are engaged at a lower salary.  I wonder what does Deputy Briscoe say to that?  When he was in opposition he made a complaint about foreigners being employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>Is the Deputy satisfied to see Irishmen driven out of employment and foreigners brought in?  I say that £84,000 is too dear a price to pay for the music we receive.  I wonder why the Minister refrained from mentioning anything about the short wave station.  Why is Deputy Briscoe silent in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will give me an explanation because there is nothing about it in the Minister's statement.  In 1948 before we got the frequencies there was a protest made by the present Taoiseach, by the present Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that £500,000 was not being spent in that particular year to allow our people in America, in Africa and other places to know what was taking place in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> In 1949 the Government of which I was a member agreed to expend £17,000 on the short wave station and a half hourly broadcast to America each day.  There is silence now from the back benchers of Fianna Fáil and from the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. They wanted then to have it to counteract the B.B.C. half hourly attack about the Partition of our country.  The Minister knows now that we were not in a position to take on propaganda debates in broadcasting to counteract even the B.B.C.  There are certain international arrangements.  I cannot understand the silence of the Government now, when they were demanding in 1948 that the short wave station be put into full operation, when we had not the frequencies.  To-day we have the frequencies but we have silence also from the Government and the back benchers of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Briscoe will enlighten us now as to why they are silent about the short wave station.  Is the position not as keen or as urgent in 1953 as it was in 1948 or 1949?  Now we have arrangements regarding frequencies and there have been conferences in Mexico and Copenhagen and, as has been reported in the Press, there may be an arrangement for selling our time and our frequencies on the short wave to other interested people.  I know that at one time&mdash;and the Minister must know now&mdash;one country was prepared to use the short wave station for sponsored programmes.  We refused to accept any arrangement with any foreign country for the use of our short wave station for the advertising of goods not manufactured in our own country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe seems to be well briefed as to the doings of the Government.  Perhaps he would say why we have no word for the past six months in connection with this very important station&mdash;so important that when the present Government was in opposition they put a motion down and took a vote of the House on it, as to our failure to put the station into operation in 1948&mdash;before we had the frequencies.  The Minister may have some explanation or excuse, but <Col N="1778" /> when we see the expenditure of over £500,000 surely £20,000 at least could be spared out of that huge sum for the half hour short wave broadcast to let our kith and kin in other countries know what is taking place in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Estimate here for this year and I did not see one penny for the short wave station. Why?  There is nothing in the Minister's speech about it.  The present Minister for Finance in 1948 was demanding even £10,000; the present Minister for External Affairs was pointing out that it was really essential to counteract propaganda being made here against our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on the question of television.  Although we have some very good sets in Wicklow Town and have had good reception for some years, I agree with him that we must go slowly.  I also agree that whatever Government is in power the Minister in charge must have a programme that will meet with the wishes of the Irish people.  He points out, very rightly, that there could be programmes of a vulgar type.  I am certain the Irish people would not tolerate them for five minutes.  There may be demands from all sides of the House to put television into operation. If an official of the Minister's Department sent out a circular pointing out that we could have television for £60,000 by increasing the wireless licence fee by 2/6 from 12/- to 14/6, I do not think very many members of the House would wish to agree with that gentleman's opinion, at the time television was only in its infancy. However, I am glad the Minister is keeping a watchful eye on this, in the <Col N="1779" /> event that, sooner than we wish, we may be forced to operate television in this country.</P>
    <P>I also hope the Minister will be able to give a greater variety.  We need greater variety in the country places. We need more of the Irish ballads and Irish songs.</P>
    <P>I am not going to criticise in any way the news broadcasts.  I am certain the Minister is taking the line that I took, that we would never interfere with those qualified journalists, that the news is a matter entirely for themselves, to give fair play to all sections, and I am sure that is always their intention.</P>
    <P>There may be demands from all sides of the House for various types of programmes.  That is why I pointed out last year that, even with the committee appointed, you still have Civil Service control over broadcasting.  The fact that the Minister must come to the Dáil with the Estimate and run the gauntlet of criticism and give his explanations, shows that the Civil Service hand is still there.  It is a careful hand, as they are in a position to do what they think would not cause any trouble.  I know they do what they believe will be fair to all sections of the community.  I have that confidence in the Civil Service from my experience of them over the past 30 years.  However, they always have an eye on the safety valve, once they are responsible to the House, whereas if they were outside the House they would be prepared to take a risk&mdash;a risk which probably would meet with greater approval than the careful method they adopt now when they avoid risk for fear of the criticism here.  I would be prepared to take the risk to try to meet the demands of the people.</P>
    <P>The Department must know now, from the votes received in the poll&mdash; and the Minister must know from going around the country himself&mdash;that there still is criticism of the broadcasting service.  I do not think it is all justified.  Some of us do not really appreciate the difficulties.  I could never understand why the broadcasting service was put under the <Col N="1780" /> Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If we were to have broadcasting tied to the Government and a Minister responsible, I always thought it should be the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is one who collects revenue, but even in that Department the accommodation is not all that should be desired.  Why broadcasting was put under that Department I could never understand and I always pointed out that it was a job the Minister for Education should take over.</P>
    <P>I do not think the report calls for much criticism.  We have a foreign orchestra.  We have seen in the papers where we are paying £35 for 30 minutes to certain officials.  Whether that would meet with the approval of the public or not I do not know.  I protest against the huge increase in connection with that service, and I ask: &ldquo;What are we getting in return?&rdquo;  I am glad to see that the Minister has made provision for instruments.  That is really necessary.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised a specific matter in connection with reception in various parts of England.  There are complaints from areas in which there are large centres of Irish population that reception is very poor.  That is true of parts of Liverpool, but the extraordinary thing is that in the centre of Liverpool reception is excellent.  Towards Birkenhead, in which there is a large centre of Irish population, reception is very bad.  Something should be done to improve the present position.</P>
    <P>My principal criticism is directed towards the expenditure of £84,000 on a symphony orchestra.  We are in rather poor circumstances, and I do not approve of squandering such a huge sum of money.  I think any criticism of foreigners in our national orchestra is fully justified.</P>

      <P>It is £42,000 for the whole year.  It represents 10 per cent. of the total cost of broadcasting.  The <Col N="1781" /> total cost is £429,000.  The Deputy may have misunderstood me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  In 1949 we agreed to provide £17,000 towards the cost of short-wave broadcasting to America for one half-hour.  Have any steps been taken in regard to that matter?</P>
      <P>I do not approve of the increase in licences to 17/6.  The people are not getting value in return for that expenditure. It must be remembered that the number who have taken out licences has increased, and from that point of view more revenue should be coming in, and there is therefore no justification for the increase in the cost of the licence.</P>
      <P>The Minister should withstand any pressure brought to bear on him in relation to the employment of foreigners.  I am not a highbrow.  I am one of the plain people.  If the Minister has been unable to resist the demand for the employment of foreigners I can only hope that it will not be necessary to adopt the tactics adopted when foreigners were employed in the Metropole. They were given short shrift.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not announce the result of the poll that was held.  I am sure other countries would have taken the same attitude as County Wicklow did, namely, 80 per cent. against having foreigners employed in our national orchestra at the expense of our own people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather astonished at the wailing Jeremiah to whom we have just listened.  It is a long road back to the days when people got good value on paying 10/- to listen through the medium of cat's whiskers.  Surely Deputy Everett ought to be one of the first to admit the progress that has been made in radio transmission.  The <Col N="1782" /> people are to-day getting more than 100 per cent. increased value for the 17/6 they pay for wireless licences as against what they got for 10/- many, many years ago.</P>
      <P>We have travelled a long and difficult road.  From the point of view of the improvements that have been made&mdash; I am sure the Minister will be one of the first to admit this&mdash;a great deal of credit must be given to Deputy Little who, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, had to overcome many criticisms and objections in laying the foundations of what we have now ultimately achieved.  Nobody suggests we have reached perfection but we can be justly proud of our broadcasting station.  Our station compares favourably with, if it is not indeed superior to, other stations to which we can tune in.  Deputy Everett has attempted to deal with a certain problem by saying that no foreigners should be employed in our radio station so long as there are unemployed musicians available in the country.  That is the standard and the test he wants to apply.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his introductory statement pointed out that there are particular types of instruments and there are no Irish musicians capable of playing them.  Take the cello, for instance, or any other instrument.  If there is not a suitable cellist at home and a cellist is needed for the orchestra, Deputy Everett contends that, if there are musicians unemployed, whether they play mouthorgans, harmonicas, bugles or any other instrument, no foreigner should be employed.</P>
      <P>The people who pay their licence fee, when they tune in to Radio Éireann, want a pleasant reception.  We could go very far down the line from the point of view of efficiency, and we could have an orchestra composed entirely of Irish musicians but who might not be first-class musicians and you might have discord instead of harmony and good orchestration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very interested to hear that with the development of musical training in the country there is now a possibility of Irish people, locally trained, finding good and permanent employment in the gradually expanding Radio <Col N="1783" /> Éireann Orchestra.  Does Deputy Everett want to stop that?  He is asking that this Vote be referred back, first of all because he thought £84,000 was being spent on the orchestra.  He now realises that it is £40,000.  The Vote will be referred back because £40,000 is being spent on the orchestra and Deputy Everett contends that so long as there are 60,000 unemployed we have no right to spend that money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He is implying that the luxury to which the Taoiseach referred was Radio Éireann Orchestra.  That is Deputy Everett's interpretation but it is not everybody's interpretation.  The people who pay a licence fee are entitled to a musical programme as well as other features.  They are entitled to good music and to good music properly rendered.  In order to provide that, money must be spent. Deputy Everett's logic is: &ldquo;You have 60,000 unemployed&rdquo;&mdash;I am not accepting that figure&mdash;&ldquo;do not spend this £40,000 and you will have an additional 20 unemployed.&rdquo;  That, is his logic. He does not realise that, at the very worst, instead of this being a luxury, it is a means of employment.</P>

      <P>Radio Éireann is a popular station.  It is listened to with interest not only by our people at home but by great numbers of people outside this country.  Deputy Everett proved that.  One of his complaints was that people he knew in certain parts of Liverpool could not get good reception. He wants the Minister to control atmospherics as well as everything else so that people in a particular area should get good reception.  It proves what I am saying, that vast numbers of people outside Ireland listen with interest to Radio Éireann.  That is proof positive that our station has made good progress and is now worth listening to.</P>
      <P>I should like to forget Deputy Everett for a few moments and ask the Minister to consider amending one of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Members of Dáil Éireann are precluded from speaking on Radio Éireann even if they wish to do so in another capacity.  There are members of this House who are members of local bodies.  A member of a local authority who is not a member of Dáil Éireann can participate in debates in connection with local authority affairs.  A member of the Dáil cannot. I would like that particular regulation to be altered or clarified so that a member of the House would not be debarred from speaking on such an occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be more rigid examination of the persons who participate in these debates.  From time to time I have listened to individuals whose statements in relation to certain domestic matters were coloured by the <Col N="1785" /> fact that they have commitments outside this country.  There should be some process other than exists at the moment of examining the persons who take part in debates.  Sometimes the persons who find their way on to a programme indulge in criticism from which it is quite clear they have an outside affiliation.</P>
    <P>Every Saturday night a programme is broadcast giving a report on the week in the Dáil.  There is a similar type of programme on the B.B.C. in relation to the week in the British Parliament.  Could the Minister extend the time given to that feature to half an hour?  The is a news report every night of the proceedings in the Dáil.  The person in charge of the programme should be given at least half an hour to give a résumé of the week's proceedings.  It is difficult to give the public a picture of proceedings in the Dáil in a quarter of an hour.  I am sure that at the end of this week the radio announcer on the proceedings in the Dáil here this week would like to devote a little more than two or two and a half minutes to Deputy Everett's speech to-night so that the people will be able to understand what he meant and what he did not mean.</P>
    <P>The Minister has correctly stated that our schools of music now have, if you like, an incentive to produce first-class musicians who will find the possibility of employment in their own country, and good employment.  I would like to see co-operation of a different nature between the station and those schools of music.  I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of adding to the already existing scholarships in order to further help the production at home of first-class musicians.  Nobody says, nobody has stated anywhere, that the Irish people are not sufficiently talented from a musical point of view.  The difficulty has been the teaching of them and the cost of teaching, and we have a great number of our young people who deserve real help in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to see can he not, out of his budgets, include a subvention in the shape of scholarships <Col N="1786" /> to the schools of music in order further to help produce the first-class musicians who are now coming into the ear of the public, because some recently employed people on Radio Éireann were recently produced, and some of them are still pursuing their studies in this regard, and are now members of the Radio Éireann Orchestra, an orchestra that is regarded as being highly efficient and of great interest to a great number of people.</P>

The Minister pointed out that the ordinary members of the public were very interested and turned up at the halls where those concerts were given.  I want to tell Deputy Everett that of all the people I know and of all the people with whom I come into conversation it would be safe to say that 80 per cent. listen in to those promenade concerts whenever they are on Radio Éireann, and the topic of conversation amongst young people who are musically minded will be on the particular promenade concert and on the particular person who was the soloist on that occasion.</P>
      <P>We have, if you like, foreigners in this country of whom we may be proud and to whom we should be grateful.

      <P>I want to get back to it if I am allowed.  I have made a number of suggestions to the Minister which I hope he will consider though I do not know if he will be able to give us the answers to-night.  The Minister has said that he has been receiving large numbers of congratulatory messages as a result of improvements generally in the programme.  I am glad that he has extended the time that Radio Éireann is now available to the public.  The more we get of it the better, I think, but what I want to say is that I hope he will not listen to pleadings of the nature of Deputy Everett's, saying that so long as you have unemployed people you must not spend money on Radio Éireann.  There are a great number of people who pay 17/6 per year now for the radio licence, and a great number of them even are unemployed, and surely to goodness they are entitled to a little pleasure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Everett says that the radio station should be under the Department of Education, and as an ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he knows that broadcasting must be under control of the Department that is in charge of the means of communication, of wires.  Does the Deputy not know that?  It sounds lovely to say that the Department of Education will run the broadcasting station, but I do not know how they could run it without having the Post Office.  Deputy <Col N="1790" /> Everett may have discovered some method by which they can do that.</P>
      <P>Surely to goodness it is education. Education is part of Radio Éireann's operations.  Is it not obvious that the Minister, the officials who run the station and the committee are bound to be in touch with all aspects?  I imagine that if the Department of Education were to take control of the broadcasting station, the one thing that would never be heard on the air would be the proceedings of Dáil Éireann&mdash;and certainly so, as a result of the admission which we had here this evening by Deputy Everett, that to have to listen to a symphony orchestra was tantamount to inflicting torture on him.</P>

      <P>I am not vexed but I am being tortured.  Deputy Everett raised Cain about the short-wave station and asked what have we all to say about it.  He said that we are all silent.  Surely Deputy Everett is aware of the procedure of this House. As a former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Everett was accorded the courtesy of being the first Deputy to speak after the Minister had introduced his statement. Consequently, mere back benchers like myself, out of politeness and out of good manners, remained silent and waited to hear the thunderings and the wailings of the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  That is why I <Col N="1791" /> could not reply to Deputy Everett's speech until the Deputy had, in fact, concluded and I was called by the Chair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett said he was not here on the occasion when the Minister referred to the reasons why progress could not be made in respect of the establishment of the short-wave station.  When I asked Deputy Everett if he had not read the explanation given by the Minister, he gave me no answer.  It is just like something that took place here the other day.  I was interrupting a Deputy and he heard every interruption and gave me my answer but when I asked him a certain question for which he had no answer he said he was deaf on that side and that he could not hear me.</P>

      <P>I hope that, at some time, the Minister will find it possible <Col N="1792" /> to get the short-wave station going. I stand by everything I said in the past in regard to a short-wave station and the need for it.  It can be heard from longer distances.  I hope that a short-wave station, or something equivalent to it, will soon be available to thousands of people who are further afield than the range of medium-wave and long-wave European stations.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will be able to break down the figures of the ordinary expenditure of our radio station and the additional expenditure for new and additional equipment, and so forth.  I do not intend to delay the House now.  I again congratulate the Minister and the Department on the steady and magnificent improvement in the programmes which we are now receiving from Radio Éireann.  I congratulate the Minister and, through him, pay a tribute to the staff of musicians who are able to give us good music, well rendered and of a standard equal to that which you can hear in other places.</P>

      <P>I do not know how many foreigners are employed by Radio Éireann.  I do not know how long it will take before we shall have completed the training of all classes of musicians to use all the different instruments and to have an all-Irish orchestra.  I hope people in other countries will not take a leaf out of Deputy Everett's book.  One of our difficulties in getting a complete orchestra together is that great numbers of our musicians find employment abroad at very remunerative salaries &mdash;at salaries greater than Radio Éireann can afford to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>I hope that Deputy Everett's song about employing foreigners is not taken up in other countries.  Some of our young people who are doing good service for Ireland in being members of orchestras of very high standards in other countries, and at good salaries to themselves, might <Col N="1793" /> be affected by such an attitude of mind.  Foreigners!  Czechoslovakians! Really, it is very difficult for me to digest all that I had to swallow here this evening during the course of Deputy Everett's speech.</P>
      <P>I believe excellent progress has been made and that the Dáil can be pleased with what has taken place.  Nobody claims&mdash;even the Minister did not claim it&mdash;that perfection has been reached.  Undoubtedly, however, progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that if Deputy Everett's mathematics or his logic convey to him that to improve the unemployment situation of Ireland you have to sack people who are in employment, then I am afraid I do not like Deputy Everett.</P>

      <P>If the humorous interludes from Radio Éireann were as entertaining as the past half hour here we might find that nobody had any criticism to offer of the station from that point of view.</P>
      <P>I think it might be no harm if Radio Éireann itself concentrated on telling the general public of the help they can get from Radio Éireann and the postal officials with regard to interference. There is a lot of unscreened electrical apparatus in this country and there is a great deal more suffering amongst listeners than we would imagine from the number of complaints.  Many people suffer in silence and do not complain, and so I think as much publicity as possible should be given to the help which the Radio Éireann and postal officials are prepared to give in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say also from personal experience, that there seems to be a good deal of interference with Radio Éireann by foreign stations.  At a certain time at night.  I think an Italian station comes roaring in on Radio Éireann.  I <Col N="1794" /> do not suppose we can do much about that, but the Radio Éireann people might take it up with the committees which deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties associated with discussing wireless broadcasting is that Deputies, by reason of the very busyness of their lives, are amongst the worst listeners to broadcasting.  I find great difficulty in getting much time to listen in, so I feel that our views on the quality of programmes through the year are not as good as those of the general public, but I must say that when I do listen-in, I find the programmes good and the subjects interesting, in the main.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the Radio Éireann Orchestra and I should like to assure the Minister and the country in general that we in the Fine Gael Party are absolutely behind whatever efforts are being made to build up a first class radio orchestra.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have a first-class orchestra.  It is something which all civilised countries demand and which the public here demand, and we feel that the young people who increasingly are taking an interest in musical matters would be the first to be behind a policy of building up a first-class orchestra.  It is perhaps not realised by some of what I might call the older age groups and by those who are not personally interested in music, that subjects like the appreciation of music have made tremendous strides in the past 15 or 20 years and that a whole generation of young people have grown up who have been trained in appreciation of music and who are demanding first-class quality from the musicians in this country.  Apart from that a proper national pride demands that we have a first-class orchestra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this question of foreign musicians, the difficulty, of course, has been that owing to the <Col N="1795" /> fact that we have had no really first-class orchestra in this country, we have not had the trained musicians, the trained instrumentalists.  Irish men and women found that, if they devoted the many years of their lives necessary to learning to play an instrument for an orchestra, at the end of that time there was no orchestra to employ them.  Fifty years ago, there were theatre orchestras, and then the cinema came along.  For a time, there were a number of cinema orchestras, and then the talkies came, which did away with them, so that from the musicians' point of view Dublin has been a very poor city to seek employment in.  Fortunately, now there is the Radio Éireann Orchestra, and I am glad to see that the committee are taking the view that it is necessary to educate and to encourage the education of our Irish musicians.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see Irish people employed in the Radio Éireann Orchestra to the fullest degree, and from that point of view I thoroughly agree with Deputy Everett.  I am sure the whole House is behind him in his desire to see that Irish musicians are employed to the fullest extent, but we must have an orchestra which can compare favourably with any similar orchestra in Europe, and in order to build up that orchestra it has been necessary to employ foreign musicians.  We have been especially weak in the wood-wind section and the Minister referred to the very small number of pupils and people who can play these instruments.  He said also that, for two of the seven instruments, there were no teachers available here, so that what we want to do is to see that not only will we get instrumentalists in Radio Éireann who are capable of playing efficiently these instruments, without which the orchestra could not function, but that we will have the men to teach our Irish musicians so that some day these Irish musicians can find employment in the orchestra.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more than one public orchestra in Ireland.  It would to my mind be a very welcome development if we could have a municipal orchestra.  If we looked at this matter <Col N="1796" /> in the way that continental cities do. Dublin would have a municipal orchestra and, in that way, we would have still further opportunities of employment for Irish musicians.  I do not know that that is feasible at the present time but many cities on the Continent with smaller populations and with a lower rateable value than Dublin, have flourishing municipal orchestras.  Musically-minded people in this country would like to see all our cities maintaining orchestras.</P>
    <P>I can see that Radio Éireann, whether it likes it or not is getting into the position of being the chief patron, in fact the only patron, of music in a large way in this country.  It is also a very important patron of drama.  We should realise that we are in a transition stage at the moment.  Thirty years ago we had very little of these cultural activities in this country except in a small way.  Now that we are starting somewhat later in this field than many other countries, we have to turn to the Government for encouragement, and I hope that Radio Éireann will realise that this rôle of patron, which is inevitably being thrust upon it, is one which it will have to take up.  The very fact that it is encouraging the teaching of musicians and helping in giving scholarships, indicates that it realises the important function it can fulfil in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the desirability of having arrangements of Irish music and original works.  In that respect it occurred to me that we had in this country until he died some years ago, a very distinguished musician, an Italian, Commendatore Esposito.  He devoted the best years of his life to encouraging music in this country.  A considerable amount of his music is unpublished, and I believe the Minister for Education has some of it in his possession.  I think it would repay investigation on the part of Radio Éireann to find out what Esposito's musical arrangements of Irish works are.  He was probably the greatest musician that this country had the honour of adopting for a very long time, and it would be interesting to hear some of his music played or to see it published, if that were possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> The Minister mentioned television. Of course, we are all somewhat at sea in regard to television in this country. I am of the opinion which is shared by other people, that television is a tremendous force and that we shall have to take it up sooner or later here.  It is apparently going to cost a tremendous amount, if and when we do take it up, but it is something we shall have to face.  Whether we could, like other small countries, operate part programmes or some system of that kind I do not know but small countries such as ours who have not very many interesting events to televise are put in a very difficult position in regard to television.  We do not have very many big international events which have a very widespread interest, nor do we have the scenes of pageantry which take place in certain other countries and which can be televised with very great interest to the people as a whole.  It is, therefore, a very difficult problem.  I agree, as I am sure other Deputies agree, with the Minister that when we introduce television we must have first-class programmes.  Nothing else would be suitable or would be worthy of the country because, whatever criticisms one may hear from time to time about Radio Éireann, nobody can say that the programmes generally are not broadcast in an efficient manner.  There is nothing second-rate about them.  A programme may not entirely come up to the standards that its originators desire but nevertheless certain efforts are made by our broadcasting station and they are not unworthy of the country.  The same standard would require to be attained in regard to television.</P>
    <P>Somebody in this debate has raised the question of how Irish programmes were received abroad.  A few weeks ago I was in Scotland, in a little place quite near Oban, and whilst visiting a café there I heard an announcement of the Irish news programme.  The people there had been listening, apparently, to the Radio Éireann orchestra and the reception was very good.  I regret to say that they turned off from the station when they heard the news announcement, because the news was <Col N="1798" /> not of particular interest to them but they had been listening to the light music programme that preceded it.  I asked them what they thought of it and they said that it was very good, that they listened to it every day and that their customers liked the programme.</P>
    <P>In connection with the radio orchestra, the Minister stated that six students, violinists, had been appointed to the orchestra on a part-time basis while they were studying. Am I correct in saying these were six extra violinists?  I am very glad to see that being done because we have to adopt different methods to build up an orchestra, methods somewhat different from those in other countries, owing to the fact that we have not had orchestras here and because the Radio Éireann Orchestra was practically the only source of employment for these people.  With regard to the orchestra itself, I am very glad to see that we have appointed an assistant conductor, Eimear Ó Broin, and I am sure that he will do very well.  I have heard him conducting and was greatly taken with his skill and the pleasure which he obviously gave to everybody. I think that the orchestra has improved. It takes time to build up a really first-class orchestra, but the orchestra is coming on very well, as was evidenced by its playing at the proms which I have been at.  I am glad to see that the orchestra is really becoming a very first-class instrument for the pleasure and interest of musical people.</P>
    <P>We are all glad to see that wireless broadcasting is being removed as far as possible from Government control. It is a cultural and an educative medium and should not be a matter for Government propaganda or for Party strife.  It is something that is in the nature of adult education and entertainment and of juvenile education also.  Radio Éireann, therefore, has a very difficult job to perform and I think it is doing reasonably well. Personally, I should like the station to have a second programme as a tremendous lot more could be done.  The station could then send out two different <Col N="1799" /> types of programme at the same time and it would give much better value to our people and satisfy many more than it can do at the present time.  Nevertheless, I think it is doing good work and, as I say, we are behind the policy of the Government in divesting themselves of direct control of broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to refer. On a previous occasion I spoke about the type of plays presented by Radio Éireann, but since then we had a play produced which has become a radio classic.  A great churchman said that the particular play to which I am referring only remained on the boards in New York for three nights and was then taken off.  Yet we have had Radio Éireann repeatedly dishing up <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> for our entertainment.  I say that it does not represent Irish life in any shape or form.  It has no entertainment value whatever.  Recently we have had to listen to another play produced by Radio Éireann and which also ran for 13 weeks in a Dublin theatre.  I cannot understand the mentality of people who put on such plays.  Surely they should be of some entertainment value.  When we listen to them on the radio we are astonished at their vulgarity and cannot understand why they put on plays of that kind.  Deputy Dockrell referred to Radio Éireann being of cultural and entertainment value.  After the production of these two plays it is about time that the people who are responsible should sit up and take notice.  I have seen a letter in the papers from a lady who is a stranger to this country about that second play saying that it would certainly shock anybody who listened to it.  There was nothing to recommend it whatever.  If that is the type of stuff we are to have produced I think it is not good for the country.  It is not good for the young people to listen to the language in these plays&mdash;language that they would not hear in any decent home in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also suggested to the Minister on a previous occasion that there should be <Col N="1800" /> a programme of entertainment for women and somebody sneeringly remarked that I wanted an old woman's programme.  We have now a women's programme which has neither entertainment nor cultural value.  We have four ladies, I do not know who they are, giving use recipes for jam and a lot of tittle-tattle talk.  There is no music of any kind.  I think that programme is no credit to whoever suggested it.  There are many other things in connection with Radio Éireann with which I do not agree. These things are objectionable and there is nothing Irish in any of them. I suggest that they should get something more in keeping with the lives of the people, something which would entertain the women of Ireland.  There are cultured women in the country areas and they would like some entertainment when the day's work is done. They can enjoy a good play or talk and good music; I do not mean continuous ceili bands or symphony orchestras. We have some good Irish singers who could give us some fine Irish songs. That is what we would like to hear and not this holding up of Ireland and its people to ridicule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like first of all to mention the Cork Station. While we hear a lot about improvements in connection with Athlone and Dublin, I believe it is essential, particularly for the southern areas, that more use should be made of the Cork Station.  Undoubtedly in the southern areas of the country we are entitled to say that greater use should be made of that station.  If the Cork Station was utilised more it would help to put a more Irish colouring, as it were, on the programmes from Radio Éireann than is the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with the views of Deputy Mrs. Rice in relation to some of the programmes.  The Minister should realise that when Deputies express their views in this House they are expressing the views of the people in the country districts.  It is most important that the Minister should realise the people in these districts are paying 17/6 per year towards financing radio services in this country and that <Col N="1801" /> they are anxious to hear programmes of their own liking over the air as opposed to some of the programmes that are heard from time to time.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, we cannot expect, by reason of the size of our stations, programmes as varied as those that can be put on by outside organisations. While that is true, it is equally important the Minister should understand that whatever about the City of Dublin, the people in the rural areas demand radio programmes which reflect a true aspect of social life in the matter of music, song or drama.</P>
    <P>If we are to get better programmes through the southern station&mdash;and we can and should get them&mdash;adequate fees should be paid to the artistes. The authorities seem to believe that there is more or less a great favour bestowed on people if they are called upon to broadcast unless they come from a certain section in certain places. I believe that talent is available in the southern part of this country&mdash; talent that should be utilised.  The talent is of such a high standard and quality that it would improve broadcasting. That being so, I say that those who broadcast are entitled to a decent reward for their services when they are asked to take part in programmes. We must realise that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether other speakers mentioned the most important problem of all&mdash;interference.  Some two years ago I drew the Minister's attention, by means of a parliamentary question, to the disgusting interference which affects listeners in areas on the southern seaboard.  In reply the Minister informed me that he hoped the matter would be remedied.  I am sorry to say this disgusting interference still exists in these areas, particularly at night time.  There is interference with the Athlone Station.  This may be a difficult problem to solve but two years have elapsed and throughout that time the people have been paying their wireless licences.  If the Minister in charge of this important Department wants to get Irish programmes over the air properly and in a satisfactory manner he must be <Col N="1802" /> prepared to do his utmost to eliminate this interference.  Towards that end the services of the engineers should be availed of.  We should, if necessary, go beyond this country to seek such expert advice as would enable us to overcome the disgusting interference that exists on the radio at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I could not afford to pass over without some reference on this Estimate.  God knows I have no desire to be personal one way or the other but while Deputies may tell us of the improvements, advancements and improved cultural standards in regard to our radio stations we have overstepped ourselves in one direction.  That is not only my view but it is the view of countless numbers of people down the country.  I refer to using the Oxford tone in connection with radio announcements in this country.  On a few occasions I myself disagreed with the members of my own family as to what station I was listening to.  I thought I was listening to the B.B.C.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to refer to this matter.  It is a joke for us to say we want Irish programmes which are in true keeping with our own Irish way of life if, at the same time, we are prepared to have people announce a programme and use a language which the Irish do not know.  Let us have a Dublin accent&mdash;I myself would prefer a Cork one&mdash;or any other kind of an Irish accent.  The sooner these announcers apply for a job on the B.B.C. the sooner will we be satisfied in this country.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I should say that many people seem to be very much in favour of the attitude and expressions of the lady announcer dealing with the hospitals' requests programme.  It is delightful to hear the announcements during this programme.  The tone of voice in which they are delivered is truly Irish and certainly expresses what every one of us is anxious to hear.  It has an Irish touch.  I want to stress particularly to the Minister that we do not want anything to do with foreign tones or accents.  We may have symphony programmes and advancements <Col N="1803" /> may have been made in one direction or another, but foreign tones or accents cannot be classified as an improvement and the sooner they are done away with the better.  I hope the present Minister will see to the matter. If not, then, with God's help, some other Minister will come along to see this matter is attended to.</P>
    <P>I do not want to condemn.  I want to avoid that.  There is one last point I want to make.  Thanks be to God, we can hear the Angelus bell over Radio Éireann at 6 p.m.  I remember&mdash;I am not going back for the purpose of raising anything controversial&mdash;coming to the Dáil for the first time in 1948.  A colleague of mine said to me that he had one ambition in life and that was to hear the bells of the Angelus at 6 p.m. over the radio.  Thanks be to God that has materialised, but the tragedy of it is that my colleague did not live to hear them.  I refer to the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, God rest his soul.  Thank God for the background we claim as our heritage.  It is a background that each and every one of us is proud of.  We want that state of affairs to continue.  I would go a step further.  After all, there is very little sense in lip-service.  Actions always count more than words.  Are we prepared, as a Christian and Catholic nation, to go the whole way and have the Rosary said over the radio in addition to hearing the bells of the Angelus?</P>
    <P>Surely that is not too much to ask in this country.  Surely we have nothing to be ashamed of in regard to the heritage that is ours.  A lead may have been given by famous personalities from such countries as the United States but it is up to us to see that we go the whole way.  Let us have at the end of the day, when the Radio Éireann programme comes to a close, something that we would all be proud of, and that is the recitation of the family Rosary over the air.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Wireless broadcasting has now become a very important matter in the lives of the Irish people. It can do an immense amount of good or an immense amount of evil.  Since <Col N="1804" /> we are in control of the position I believe that Irish broadcasting can be made do an immense amount of good. I believe that great strides have been made since we made a start with it. We find that an improvement has been recorded each year.  I believe that this new type of education can be of vast importance.  We cannot but keep our eyes on how things are going.  Irish broadcasting affords an opportunity of bringing out the best that is in our people.  The outside world is giving us everything that is the worst, but let us do our best as far as we can.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments that were expressed by Deputy Mrs. Rice. I was disgusted, and so were a great number of people, with many of the Irish plays that I have heard broadcast from time to time.  I was disgusted at the vulgarity and the dirt of a low-meaning type that came out in many of these Irish plays.  It is time, I think, that they were scrapped.  I would ask the Minister to see that that type of play is excluded.  It does not depict Irish life.  It shows the mentality of the back street, the dirt of the lowdown public house.  We do not want that.  That type of play may be taken in some places to represent Ireland as a whole.  It does not and, as I have said, it does not depict our Irish life. When I listen to the broadcast of such plays I feel disgusted and so do all decent types of people.  I ask that these plays be cut out.  Let us have plays broadcast which really depict Irish life in all its grand aspects, and Irish life can be grand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing which is of vast importance to the country, and that is that in these broadcasts there should be something done to bring about a revival of the old Irish spirit, the real national spirit of the country. I am satisfied that we are living in a materialistic age.  Over the last 25 years, this country has gone in almost entirely for materialism and has no room for nationalism.  It is time that the mind of the new generation was focused on the old Irish Ireland spirit, on the advancement of the country, and not only on her language and culture but on her reunification.  We do not <Col N="1805" /> hear half enough about that.  There is a broadcast once a year on St. Patrick's Day by the Taoiseach.  I believe that we should have such a broadcast at least once a month of something of value to the country&mdash; about the ending of Partition.  I believe that many of the leaders in our lost province should have the opportunity, at least once a month, of coming down here and airing their grievances from our broadcasting station. It is up to us to do that because they have their grievances.  They feel that we are letting them down.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the old material spirit were resurrected in the country that great things would come out of it. Many of us remember how that was done when we were much younger than we are to-day.  About the year 1917 or 1918 things were at a very low ebb in the national sense.  Very few people at the time were prepared to come forward and give of their best to resurrect that old martial spirit.  But small groups of people did come forward and did succeed in reviving the national spirit of the country.  More than 30 years have passed since then, and this is the time when the new generation should be asked to engage in the work of reviving the national spirit&mdash;to take on where we are leaving off.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should have weekly, monthly and yearly broadcasts on the curse that Partition has been to this country.  I would ask the Minister to take note of what I am saying because this is a matter which is talked about at Gaelic League classes, in G.A.A. circles and by other groups of people.  They feel the time has come for a new spirit to be aroused amongst the rising generation, something to combat the wave of materialism which is so prevalent in the country.  To-day people want to get everything cheap and to get it as quickly as they can. They want to get as much money as they can.  That is the spirit which predominates to-day, and as long as it is there the country will get nowhere.  It is the spirit that will kill our country and hold it back.  I hope that we will be able to get away from that materialistic outlook and that we will see a revival of the old national spirit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> I was glad to hear the sentiments that were expressed by Deputy Desmond.  I, too, feel proud when I hear the Angelus bell over our broadcasting system.  I hope, as he has said, that we will go a step further by having the Rosary broadcast.  His ambition in that respect is my ambition.  If we do not hear the Rosary broadcast daily, I hope that at least we will hear it once a week.  We belong to the Irish nation and we are proud of that.  We are a Catholic nation.  We should not be ashamed of our heritage, and I hope that, at least on one day of the week, we will have the opportunity of proclaiming to the world what we are and who we are by having the Rosary recited over the radio.  Let us have it said publicly.  It would be a grand and a noble thing and something that Ireland could be proud of.  By doing that we would be proclaiming that we are not steeped in paganism and materialism.  I would ask the Minister to take note of what we are asking him to do, because what we are saying here the people are thinking.  I am putting forward these suggestions in the hope that good will come out of them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Question Time, it seems to me that something very peculiar has happened there.  There was an immediate switch and a change from a popular compère, Eric Boden, He was shoved out and a new compère, Joe Linnane, brought in.  I have listened to both and I would say that the last is no improvement on the first. He was very popular and the people enjoyed his Question Time very much. I would like to know why there was a switch and a change.  I was horrified when I was told by a person in a fairly responsible position that the compère earns £35 for a 45-minute service.  He is a lucky man.  We talk about T.D.'s salaries but there is a man who can sleep for half a year and get £35 for 45 minutes.  That is too easily earned money.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Desmond that some of the speakers in the broadcasting station are not up to the mark.  I am a plain simple Irish bloke myself and I like to hear a clear and distinct speaker.  With regard to some of our broadcasters, some of the <Col N="1807" /> females, you would think, listening to them, that they had a potato in their mouths.  One cannot know what they are saying.  I think it is of enormous importance that the voices of those people should be clear and distinct. That they are not clear may be due to the fact that they either stand too near or too far away from &ldquo;the mike&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Deputy Everett, in his time, made an earnest effort to have a completely Irish setup.  I agree that in certain cases foreigners must be employed to train those under them. While I agree with that I say that every effort should be made to run Irish Ireland in our own way and to use Irish brains and skill wherever we can do so.  I understand that a new conductor has been brought in.  I believe he is a splendid man and that he is getting £2,000 for eight months per year.  That is pretty handsome.  He can sleep for the other four months if he likes.  These things, I believe, are going a bit too high.  Is it any wonder that we have to pay high fees for our wireless licences?  I know that you must pay reasonable fees if you want to get good service but I think that is going too far.</P>
    <P>In general, I would say the station is improving each year, and as each year succeeds another, I hope it will continue to improve.  I have no complaints to make beyond those on which I have focused attention.  The Minister is working hard and his efforts are, in the main, successful.  If he concentrates more on the Irish Ireland aspect of things and less on the outside world he will achieve something worthy of our nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to agree with Deputy Giles and with others who have complimented the Minister on the fact that Radio Éireann has improved in the last few years. There is undoubtedly a wider variety of programme and the programmes are in general more interesting than they were in the past.  There is, of course, still a very great deal of room for improvement.  I regret that I am not as <Col N="1808" /> highly cultured as Deputy Everett and therefore cannot speak with authority on such things as symphony concerts. I regret also that the Minister's decision, endorsed by Deputy Dockrell, to bring in some outside artistes has caused a rift in the coalition lute and that Deputy Everett has even threatened that he will not allow a Coalition Government to be formed on the basis of Deputy Dockrell's policy of employing outside artistes.</P>

Every year we try to advise whatever Minister is in power to take steps which we think he ought to take in order to improve the service.  As Deputy Everett says, however, we Deputies are probably the worst possible advisers the Minister could have because we get very few opportunities of listening to the regular programmes on the radio.  Perhaps it is only on Sunday evening that the average Deputy has a chance of listening in and perhaps this would not be every Sunday evening either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid so.  I would like to endorse the complaint that was made by Deputy Mrs. Rice about Sunday night plays.  They are a disgrace to Radio Éireann and this country. Nobody objects to a broadcast play if it has a spice of humour, but the type <Col N="1809" /> of play that we hear broadcast and particularly those mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Rice contain no spark of humour.  They are sordid, vulgar and to a great extent outrageously profane. It appears to be impossible to find any writer capable of writing a decent play suitable for broadcasting. We hear there is a great resurgence of drama in Ireland, that there are a great many new writers coming into the field, but apparently the type of material they are producing is on a very low level.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Minister has authority over Radio Éireann he ought to give a direction that such plays as <i>Home is the Hero, The Playboy of the Western World,</i> and other such plays should never again be presented.  Anything that is in the nature of comedy is good, but when you have something that is merely vulgar, difficult to listen to, and trying on the nerves as these plays are, they should be cut out completely.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Director of Broadcasting may say: &ldquo;What can we do?  We must take whatever we can get.&rdquo;  My view is that if you cannot get anything more suitable than what is being broadcast on Sunday nights it would be better to eliminate these radio dramas altogether and give us Din Joe, Eric Boden, Joe Linnane, or somebody else like them, but not to inflict on the Irish people that type of play which must be turned off if there are any children listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this matter last year and I would like to repeat the suggestion that Radio Éireann should act as a patron of good drama, and that since they are in a position to offer a reward to playwrights they could offer a fairly substantial prize to any writer who would produce a good radio play.  It may be that certain plays are a success on the stage but that they do not come over as well on the air as on the stage. Therefore, the Minister should invite people to write good radio plays specially for Radio Éireann.  If they are based on Irish history and the patriots in the history of Ireland, there is an inexhaustible mine of drama of the highest and noblest type.  Our <Col N="1810" /> country's history was for hundreds of years a sad and glorious struggle of brave men who fought against almost overwhelming odds, going down to defeat in most cases but going down nobly and heroically to death.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with what I understood Deputy Everett to say about the popular ballad.  I think a popular ballad that is well sung by a good singer is always good entertainment in this country.  The ordinary people like those ballads and there will always be a substantial listening public for them, particularly in the rural areas.  That is why I was rather disappointed when Deputy Everett himself rushed into this House to prevent one popular ballad being presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>Some people who claim that they are highly cultured object to these rustic ballads, but the average rural person appreciates them and wishes them to be continued.  I may not <Col N="1811" /> be as highly cultured as Deputy Everett.  I am not a judge of high-class music, but I think we should have some more good tenors or singers on Radio Éireann, people who might follow the noble example of the late John McCormack&mdash;though they could never compete with him&mdash;people who know how to deliver their songs in good clear diction so that the words and music will appeal to the ear.  Artistes of that type should always be in demand by Radio Éireann, as they will always be listened to.  When heard outside this country, singing songs of an Irish nature based on Irish life, they carry a message throughout the length and breadth of the world as far as Radio Éireann can carry it.  They bring it to Irish exiles abroad, and for that reason they should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>I am altogether in favour of political controversy on the radio.  Every type of discussion, which may be of a contentious nature, should be encouraged, provided it is carried out by people who have a sense of humour, who can keep their tempers under control and who can make their points in a reasoned and reasonable way.  I would not suggest that we should have frequent debates as between the Government and the Opposition.  People get tired of that very quickly.  However, we could have debates on proposed legislation, which might be equally controversial and which would always be of interest.  That type of broadcast should be encouraged.  People generally like to hear a clash of views on questions of topical interest.  Talks on topical affairs are highly appreciated, and it would be even more highly appreciated if there were a debate from time to time on topical subjects that are under the public notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radio Éireann is a national service which reaches out to every part of the country, even to remote rural areas where the daily paper is not regularly taken.  In that way it brings a certain amount of variety and information to people who are somewhat cut off from the ordinary source of news.  I remember hearing about two tourists who visited a very remote part of the County Wicklow some time ago.  In a <Col N="1812" /> mountain district they came upon a very old man and, being smart city fellows, they said to themselves: &ldquo;Here is the real native Irishman, the man who has no contact at all with modern life.&rdquo;  To try him out they asked him about the weather and he said: &ldquo;I think it will rain to-morrow.&rdquo; They were anxious to find out how he knew so much about the weather and asked him did he judge by the sun or the stars or the moon.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you cannot depend upon them now, but the young lady on the wireless says that there is a trough of low pressure moving from the east; when you hear that you can look out for rain.&rdquo;  I mention that to show that, no matter how remote the district, you cannot get away from Radio Éireann or broadcasting generally.  That is all to the good.</P>
    <P>If television has a future, as Deputy Dockrell said, it will have to be considered. It involves considerable expense and unless the service can be made to pay it should not be undertaken. If we are to have television programmes at all I have one view to express, and that is that they should be of short duration each day.  I have heard complaints in countries where television is in operation that the children and young people are kept away from their school exercises and their work for too long periods. Therefore, if we have television programmes here they should be of the shortest possible duration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell said that we have not very much to televise.  He said we have none of the big events that take place in other countries, or the pageantry of other countries.  I do not think there are any people better qualified to provide pageantry than the Irish people.  During An Tóstal there was a pageant in Aughrim dealing with the life of the O'Byrne clan and it was remarkably well carried out.  If it were to form part of a television programme it could possibly have been better done.  Events like that could be televised here, perhaps even better than such events are televised in other countries.  We have the spirit and enterprise for organising features of that kind.  Criticism should not deter the <Col N="1813" /> Minister in regard to television programmes, but this is a matter that will have to be carefully considered from the point of view of economics and cost; if it can be put into operation it will be a tremendous force in the development of Irish art and culture and in the advancement of our people.</P>
    <P>With regard to religious broadcasts, on that matter the Minister should be guided by the ecclesiastical authorities.  They are the people best qualified to advise and their advice should be sought and taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Deputy contributing to this debate could succeed in making the discussion develop into a political discussion because, when speaking about Radio Éireann, one is merely expressing a personal opinion or demonstrating one's personal taste.  No matter of principle is involved.  The jazz singer and the member of the symphony orchestra can be as Tory, Liberal or Conservative as they like. I believe that we in this House, no matter what the public may think, are the best fitted to convey the opinions of the country as a whole to the broadcasting officials in Radio Éireann through the person of the Minister. It is not for us to criticise personalities in or on Radio Éireann or attempt to suggest what particular artistes should be allowed to broadcast, but we should not be denied an opportunity of expressing our views on the artistes and the types of programmes that are presented.</P>
      <P>The reason I say that we are best fitted to give our views, or the views of the public, on Radio Éireann is because if it were left to the individual listeners to make their views known individually to the advisory council or to the Minister a very, very small number would give their views, so that, overall, I think the views expressed here may be construed as being the views of the country in general.  From what I have heard here to-night, business people, farmers, legal men and clerks have given their views and these views must be considered to be the views of the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> The Minister should, however, try to get the views of the public with regard to Radio Éireann in general and the programmes presented in the past year in particular.  I have often wondered how many people listen to Radio Éireann.  It would be interesting to know what proportion of licence holders listen to our own station.  A the moment if a listener is not satisfied with the programme from Radio Éireann he simply switches over some other station.  He has a variety of entertainment at his command from other stations.  It would be interesting to know if there is big support for the present programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, gave a pretty comprehensive survey of the operations and activities of Radio Éireann in the past year, but I am dissatisfied with the method in which this Vote is presented in the Book of Estimates. There are only three headings &mdash;Expenses of Broadcasting, Equipment, inclusive of labour, and Appropriations-in-Aid. No information is given in the Estimate.  There is no reference to salaries.  We are not in a position to express an opinion as to whether or not musicians employed in the orchestra are adequately paid.  We do not know whether members of the symphony orchestra are paid too much or too little.</P>
    <P>That is of particular concern to us as members of the Labour Party.  In presenting the Estimate next year the Minister should revert to the former system and give us details in respect of salaries and wages, the cost of operating programmes, the cost of musical instruments, travelling expenses, plant and equipment, expenses in connection with international conferences and conventions, telegrams and telephones, the amount paid in respect of the radio journal and the other incidental expenses.  I do not suggest that anything is being concealed in this Vote because of the method employed.  If my suggestion is adopted it will have the effect of widening the scope of the debate and Deputies will be in a better position to make their comments on Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Will the advisory council, set up last year with the approval of the majority <Col N="1815" /> of this House, present a report?  The Minister, as I said, gave a fairly comprehensive report on Radio Éireann but that report is limited of necessity. It would be interesting if the advisory council would present an annual report which would be made available to Deputies and to the public.  I would like to know also, whilst I do not doubt their usefulness, the number of times that body met during the year so that the public may be in a position to know whether or not it has been worth while to appoint this advisory council.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss actual presentations on Radio Éireann, I would ask the Minister a few questions.  By what method or by whom are the commentators, masters of ceremony and the various announcers appointed?  There are many good commentators and many bad commentators on Radio Éireann who just seem to go into Radio Éireann.  Nobody seems to know when, how, and under what conditions they were appointed. It seems to me that some of them are there for good, whether they are good, bad or indifferent, and there does not seem to be much element of competition with regard to the appointment of commentators and announcers.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a question which a majority of people to whom I have spoken about Radio Éireann announcers have asked me.  I have heard Deputy Giles talking about announcers.  I would not agree at all with him with regard to the lady announcers in Radio Éireann.  I think they are excellent.  Most of the male announcers are excellent.  I should like to know who employs the announcer with the super-standard English accent?  I have nothing to say about his accent but it is not racy of the soil. Listening to this particular announcer, whoever he may be, one would never associate his accept with Radio Éireann.  Deputies have various accents, peculiar to the counties or parts of Ireland from which we come.  The particular announcer to whom I refer has an accent which could not be remotely connected with any part of this country.  I do not take exception to his accent, but I am making a <Col N="1816" /> criticism or raising a query with regard to the accent that is employed on an Irish radio station.  I can safely say that his peculiar pronunciation of many words, in standard English, is not readily understood by some of the people whom I know and certainly not by me sometimes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, therefore, to deal with the appointment of these announcers and commentators and to give us some information as to whether they are permanent or not and as to their general conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Any criticism or remarks that may be made about Radio Éireann are purely matters of taste and opinion. We could talk all night here about the symphony orchestra and find every second person saying that he did not like symphony music.  There is no use in a Deputy like Deputy Briscoe inviting Deputy Everett to a symphony orchestra with the assurance that he would be converted after one performance. Deputy Everett may not like symphony music.  Deputy Briscoe may like symphony music.  My taste is in between.  There is great room for the symphony orchestra.  I am one of those who did not know and still do not know much about music but I was converted to the symphony orchestra and to symphony music.  I have not heard a great deal of criticism in my part of the country with regard to the frequency of the symphony orchestra on Radio Éireann.  That may be due to the fact that the people of Wexford for the last three years have been fortunate enough to hear the symphony orchestra and to see the players in person on a Wexford stage.  That type of activity on the part of Radio Éireann, or should I say on the part of the Wexford Festival Committee, has done a great deal to promote interest in the type of music performed by the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.</P>
    <P>The question of employment of foreign musicians is, again, a matter of opinion.  Deputy Everett and other Deputies agree that there is a necessity to have foreign musicians in this country to act in the capacity of instructors.  What is worrying some of us and some of the Deputies who sit <Col N="1817" /> behind the Minister is how long this instruction is to continue, when will we see a decrease in the number of foreign musicians in the symphony orchestra and, above all, what Radio Éireann is doing to induce young Irish musicians to adopt musical careers with a view to becoming members of the symphony orchestra.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks with regard to the scarcity of a particular type of musician in this country were interesting. May I make a suggestion, for what it is worth?  Has any effort been made to train the young members&mdash; and most of them are young&mdash;in the Army School of Music?  There are admirable facilities for musical training in the Army School of Music.  A very famous foreigner, Colonel Fritz Brase, did a great deal for the Army School of Music and the various Army bands.  That school is capable of producing young recruits for training and eventual membership of an orchestra like the symphony orchestra.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister could explore the possibilities of training&mdash;I will not say recruiting&mdash;some of the members of a school with which practically everybody in this country is familiar&mdash;Artane.  Whether the particular type of music taught in Artane School would fit them for membership of the symphony orchestra or not I do not know, but if the Minister were to explore those two avenues he would find that there are in these two places that I have mentioned young Irishmen who would be capable of being trained and eventually recruited into the orchestra.</P>
    <P>We do not voice Party views here. I can disagree 100 per cent. with Deputy Desmond, Deputy Keyes or Deputy Everett.  I want to make one comment in respect of one particular item that is a regular feature of Radio Éireann at present, that is, &ldquo;Take the Floor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My frank opinion of it is&mdash;and I know that the people who present &ldquo;Take the Floor&rdquo; and who take part in it will not take offence&mdash;that the sooner they take them off the floor the better because it is neither funny nor does it portray Irish life as I believe <Col N="1818" /> it is intended to do.  It is not so much for the Minister to decide, but that is a point of view that I have about it, and I am sure that if the Director of Radio Éireann gets similar viewpoints to the one I express here, he will possibly consider at least making some change in it.</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Deputies in congratulating the Director of Radio Éireann on the introduction of the topical talks after the midday news. There have been some excellent talks, and above all I think that the director may take note that there have been some admirable speakers giving those talks&mdash;one in particular who happens to frequent this House pretty often and whose voice is admirably suited for broadcasting.  Generally, I may say that those talks are most informative and deal with subjects which I should think interest the big majority of the listeners to Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I think that the public discussions have been very successful but the delivery of those taking part in them has not been successful on many occasions. The microphone has been placed wrongly or the speakers were not in the proper position when speaking through the microphone.  The technicians or those in charge of that particular branch of entertainment ought to pay more attention to the delivery of the people who are taking part in those discussions.</P>
    <P>Again, if I might express a personal point of view I want to say, as against what Deputy Captain Giles said, that the new Question Time is something like the old Question Time that we had some years ago and that the person who is now compering the new Question Time is far beyond the person who was there before him.  The person who was there before him talked too much and Question Time so far as I could see represented only about 10 per cent.  of the whole time allocated to that particular feature.</P>
    <P>We have had, year after year, discussions about the type of plays presented on Radio Éireann, and one particular play was mentioned, <i>Home is the Hero.</i>  I did not have an opportunity of listening to that particular <Col N="1819" /> play, but there were criticisms offered here last year in regard to other plays of a similar type&mdash;<i>The Playboy of the Western World, Red Roses for Me,</i> and those other plays.  Some Deputies thought that they should not be presented in Radio Éireann.  They have been presented in various theatres in this country and big exception was not taken to them.  Deputy Cogan, as his opinion, said that that type of play ought to be spiced with, I think he said, variety and humour.  We cannot get away from the fact that our Irish plays&mdash;and it is a tribute to them&mdash;are plays with reality, and I would humbly suggest that many of the plays that have been written by Irishmen, many famous plays in which we have taken pride when they were presented in other countries, are more or less on the lines of the particular plays that are now objected to, and I think that we must have a sense of reality towards those plays.  If one were to examine the text of the Shakespearean plays which were regarded as famous and about which nobody would have qualms of conscience about presenting on Radio Éireann we would find them in many cases just as vulgar and sordid, and more so, than some of the plays that have been mentioned here last year and in the debate to-night.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very good step to have an extension of hours from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock in the morning, especially with the new broadcasts at 8 and 9. So far as I am concerned, the interval music between a quarter past eight and 9 o'clock gives a certain brightness to Radio Éireann and makes people a little more familiar with Radio Éireann.  I might say that the type of music, whoever selects it&mdash;I think it is a sponsored programme&mdash;is admirably suited to that particular part of the day.  I also welcome the introduction of the light orchestra from 11 to 11.30 at night time.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question in respect of the news.  I would like to know who provides the news for Radio Éireann.  I wonder if the well-established journalists in the various towns and villages and cities in the country are commissioned to provide <Col N="1820" /> the news to Radio Éireann. Quite briefly I would like to say that I would hate to think that the news was being provided from down the country to Radio Éireann from scab reporters.  When I say scab reporters I am not suggesting that they are.  I am only asking the Minister for information, and I would like to see a system whereby recognised and established newspaper journalists in the towns and cities and in the rural areas generally would provide the news from their locality to Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised that in his 22-page speech on the Vote for Radio Éireann the Minister did not mention the sponsored programmes.  I might be wrong in that, but I read his speech and I listened to the greater portion of it, and not once did he mention the sponsored programmes; but every one of us who listen to Radio Éireann must realise that, at a fair guess, from 20 to 25 per cent. of the time is devoted to sponsored programmes. I do not know whether that is accurate or not, but there is approximately one hour in the morning or three-quarters of an hour, about two hours in the afternoon or sometimes two and a half hours, and a half-hour at night time.  That is a total of about four hours, and I think broadcasting time on Radio Éireann is roughly ten or ten and a half hours.</P>
    <P>The sponsored programmes seem to be getting bigger and bigger.  Whether it is good or bad is again a matter of opinion.  I wonder was there a particular significance in the Minister's omission to deal with those sponsored programmes?  I am not particularly keen on certain types of sponsored programmes because I do not believe that Radio Éireann has sufficient control over the sponsored programmes. Maybe the viewpoint is that as long as those sponsors pay their money they are entitled to present whatever type of entertainment they want to.  This question was raised last year and the Minister, I think&mdash;I do not pretend to quote him accurately&mdash;said that he was considering the question of sponsored programmes themselves and others arising out of complaints or criticism by some Deputies about the type of <Col N="1821" /> music that was presented, that it was very low-class.  I would like to know if there is any type of censorship on the sponsored programmes.  That might be a harsh word.  Perhaps censorship would not be the right word; but is there any type of vetting of those sponsored programmes, because as far as I could see they are foreign altogether to the type of music that is ordinarily presented by Radio Éireann.  I am not one who will object to a certain amount of jazz, dance music and jitter-bug music, or whatever you like to call it, but I would point out that dance music and jazz predominate in the sponsored programmes.  During the course of the debate on this Estimate last year, some Deputy suggested that the public wanted that type of music and that the sponsors knew they wanted it.  I do not believe that that is so.  I do not believe that these sponsored programmes cater for the general body of listeners in the country.  It was suggested that the musical items which are played are played as a result of requests.  May I point out, as I pointed out last year, that only a small number of sponsored programmes from Radio Éireann make their musical presentations by request?  It is all very fine to say that the sponsors pay their money and that, therefore, they should be entitled to decide what type of music they will play.  There should be some kind of control in this matter by the Director of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I often lean to the view that we have too many sponsored programmes from Radio Éireann.  Occasionally, some of us tune in to Radio Luxembourg which is, I think, exclusively a sponsored programmes station.  It can give its minutes or hours of enjoyment, but I do not think that anybody would suggest that it is an admirable station from the point of view of being a national station or that any of us would like to see Radio Éireann become an entirely sponsored programmes station.  Do the sponsored programmes mean a great deal financially to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?  I do not know whether they do or not, but I suggest that if the financial aspect is not a very compelling factor the Minister should <Col N="1822" /> go very slowly in regard to the extension of sponsored programmes.  I humbly suggest that in a national radio station, where the aim is supposed to be the promotion of Irish culture and culture and the arts in general, if 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. of our programmes consist of sponsored programmes which are, in the main, jazz and dance music, we cannot boast that our radio station is, in fact, being used for the promotion of Irish culture and culture and the arts in general.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate whoever is responsible&mdash;I am sure the Minister did not do it himself&mdash;for the very fine arrangement that has been produced, I think by the symphony orchestra, of our National Anthem.  Though we may not have done so in public, many of us have, on occasion, criticised privately among ourselves and to our friends the various arrangements we have hitherto heard of our National Anthem.  In some of those arrangements the Anthem was played in jazz time, while in other arrangements it was played too slowly.  All of those different arrangements managed to avoid doing what a National Anthem is supposed to do&mdash;to make those listening to it profoundly aware of the fact that it means something and symbolises something. One always thinks of a National Anthem as stirring people and reminding people of their country and of their heritage and of what their country stands for.  In my view, the new arrangement of the National Anthem is a credit to Radio Éireann and to the gentleman or gentlemen responsible for the arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I only listen to the radio when I am in Wexford, and I must make this complaint now which may seem local in its character.  It concerns interference.  Last year the Minister spoke about electrical interference and he very reasonably suggested remedies to the public which would go a long way towards correcting it.  With the introduction of so many new electrical machines and with people introducing washing machines, scrubbing machines, polishers, refrigerators and so forth into their homes, interference has become much more widespread and much more <Col N="1823" /> noticeable in radio reception.  The Minister stated that there was a campaign in his Department to try to seek out the root of this interference and to advise as to how best to remedy it. I do not know whether the Minister has any further information to give us on this matter when he is replying or whether he can tell us what success met their efforts in that campaign.  In that connection, I wonder if the help of another very efficient body could be enlisted with a view to correcting or at least minimising the electrical interference which has become so widespread. I wonder if the aid of the E.S.B. could be enlisted by Radio Éireann in this respect?</P>
    <P>The reception from Radio Éireann in Wexford town in the morning, afternoon and early part of the evening is pretty good.  At night time, however, we seem to get all sorts of stations, from China right across to the U.S.A. It may be that this is a matter over which the Minister has no control.  I suppose he is subject to international agreements or to an agreement with some international body with regard to the wavelength of Radio Éireann. Perhaps, when he is replying, he would give us some information as to the possibility of getting a more satisfactory wavelength or a stronger transmission or some other method by which interference from all these various foreign and very foreign stations that cut in from time to time can be eliminated from the Radio Éireann wavelength.</P>
    <P>This Vote refers to wireless broadcasting but the subject of television has been introduced.  I would be entirely behind the Minister and those who advise him to go slow in the matter of television.  Undoubtedly television will affect the social life of this country.  Television has not advanced nearly far enough for the Government or the people of this country to experiment in any small way with it.  To say the best of it, any television reception which I have seen in this country was very bad.  For anybody or for any group of persons to suggest that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Government should <Col N="1824" /> advance even a £10 note to experiment in the matter of television in this country would, I think, be just crazy. I know that the Minister does not need anybody to say this to him but I should like to say, in conclusion, that it should be a long time yet before either he, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or anybody else as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, should experiment in the matter of television in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me at the outset support Deputy Corish in his appeal on behalf of wireless licensees who cannot take advantage of Radio Éireann because of interference.  I know towns and villages throughout the country where a licensed radio owner, if he wishes to listen in to a broadcast, not merely from Radio Éireann but from other broadcasting stations, must first of all approach the local butcher and ask him to turn off the mincer or must ask the local garage proprietor to cut out the compressor. There should be no necessity for any radio licence holder to place himself in such a position that he is under a compliment to the owner of a mixer or a compressor.  It is the duty of the Minister who receives the money for the radio licences to ensure that these licensees will get proper reception on their radio and, further, it should be the duty of the Minister to employ individuals to go round the country and find out who these pirates are and to put an end to the interference which they cause.  That is something which the Minister should give serious consideration to in fairness to all those people who are paying the exact same licence fee as radio owners in Dublin City and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on another matter.  Two years ago, I appealed to the Minister to include in the news broadcasts from Radio Éireann information in connection with the fishing industry.  I appealed to him to have broadcast each night and each morning information as to the catches and the price of fish landed at the various ports and the prices obtaining in the various markets <Col N="1825" /> all over the country.  The Minister has very kindly&mdash;and very wisely, if I may say so&mdash;included each morning the prices of fish from the Dublin market and the various other markets.  I should like now to ask him to go further and to include in the broadcasts each night information as to the landings of fish so as to enable buyers, both retail and wholesale, to know when there is likely to be a glut on the market and where fish are procurable and also to let the housewife know whether she has been done in the eye by the retailer or the wholesaler.  I appeal to him particularly to consider broadcasting the landings of fish each night at the various ports.</P>

      <P>Yes, or the greyhound racing results from Celtic Park, Dunmore Park and other tracks in the country.  It is not so very tough and it is of vital interest to the fishing industry, and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter with a view to seeing what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers have spoken about the employment of the rural artistes in broadcasts.  Until artistes are paid a proper fee, a fee which will enable them to come here to Dublin and pay travelling and hotel expenses, there is not the slightest hope of encouraging them to come here.  I have known artistes from County Donegal who have received engagements to broadcast from Radio Éireann on a Monday afternoon or Monday evening.  In order to be here for their broadcast, they would require to travel down on Saturday, remain in Dublin over the week-end, do the broadcast on Monday evening, and go back on Tuesday.  For that, they are offered the magnificent sum <Col N="1826" /> of £4 4s. Od.  That is not right.  If we want these people to give us the benefit of the art they have, we must pay them.  That is the only way in which we can secure their services, other than by having local broadcasts in rural Ireland, enough of which, in my opinion, we have not got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the sum of £4 4s. Od. intended to cover their travelling expenses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything.  Is it any wonder we do not hear them?  I should like to see more of these local artistes employed, but we must pay them if we want them, and, until we make up our minds that we must give them a fee, in addition to travelling expenses, we are not going to encourage them to give us the benefit of the arts which they have acquired or which God gave them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not travelling at a loss in these circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they are. If Deputies wish to know why they do travel, it is because they are generally engaged by some gramophone company to make records, from which they secure royalties, and they depend on these royalties to compensate them for any loss they may incur.  That is the only reason they come here.  It was an honour at one time to be able to say that you broadcast, but when it hits the pocket, especially in these days, the honour is scarcely worth it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to see school programmes, but they are absolutely useless until we have some liaison between the Department of Education and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs whereby sets will be installed in the schools.  There is no use in broadcasting school programmes when the school has no means of receiving them.  Certain societies and charitable organisations have provided the blind with free radio sets and there is no reason why the Department of Education should not provide free wireless sets, or provide sets on payment of a small contribution, to the schools, so that we could have proper school programmes broadcast each day <Col N="1827" /> or on a number of days a week which would be of a highly educative value for pupils.  It is a matter I recommend to the Minister.  It is possibly a matter for the two Departments, but I think it is well worth considering.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk about television and I should like to see a television station in the country. There is no use in our pretending that television is only in its infancy. Within the past three weeks, I had the privilege of staying in a very large hotel where there was a television set in every bedroom, with 100 per cent. reception.  Television is not in its infancy and it is one of the best methods of education available, apart from its entertainment value.  There have been a number of inter-State agreements recently between the Government of the Six Counties and the Government of the Republic, and I should like to know if it would not be possible to arrive at some arrangement whereby an all-Ireland television broadcasting station could be set up. It is something which the Minister might consider, possibly not this year but in the future.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the employment of non-nationals in Radio Éireann.  I know nothing about that, but I do know that we exported to New Zealand an Orchestra leader second to none in the world, while we have imported a leader for the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  That is something which is very hard to understand. There may be a reason for it but I find it most difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>There is one thing on which we are all agreed in this House&mdash;we are all anti-Partitionists.  Unfortunately, however, we are not making use of the one medium available to us to publish our views on anti-Partition.</P>

      <P>Let us use the one we have first.  We are not making proper use of it.  There should be weekly&mdash;nightly, if possible&mdash;talks from Radio Éireann on this curse of Partition.  I do not suggest that we <Col N="1828" /> should be belligerent about it.  There may be two sides to this question of Partition and there may be people in the Six Counties who think they have a proper answer to the arguments we put forward.  They should be invited to come down here and to give talks setting out their views.  The world and listeners generally can then decide on which side is right.</P>

      <P>The listener some day will record a vote which elects a representative to Parliament.  That representative, in turn, elects a Government and in that way the listener has a say and may influence the member of Parliament in the country in which he resides.  Not only would I have broadcasts by all speakers, Partitionists and anti-Partitionists, but I would have these broadcasts relayed through the United States of America.  There is no reason why we should not be able to procure a short-time sponsored programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <P>All I want to do is to make use of what we have got already.  I know that if we put forward a demand for a short-wave station the Minister will say: &ldquo;Where are we going to get the money?&rdquo; While we are waiting for the short-wave station let us make use of the one we have got.  Let us have these broadcasts relayed in America by way of taking a short-time sponsored programme even if we have to pay for it.  Let records be made of that to be relayed all over the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we would be spending money much more usefully in that way than in sending out anti-Partition leaflets to the converted.  I think that even the <Col N="1829" /> ordinary programmes should be interrupted now and again to remind listeners that anti-Partition views are held, not only by all the representatives in this Parliament here but that there are also anti-Partitionists in the Six-County Parliament and that a number of representatives have been elected to that Parliament solely for the purpose of abolishing Partition. These gentlemen from the Six Counties should be invited to come down here to express their views over the radio. Similarly the Partitionists should be invited to come down here to give their views.  In that way we could put before the English-speaking world the evils which flow from the curse of Partition.</P>

Caithfear níos mó ama do thabhairt i rith an lae do cheisteanna a bhaineas leis an Ghaeilge, an Ghaeilge féin, ceol Gaelach, scéalaíocht, drámaíocht agus mar sin de sa Ghaeilge.  Sé mo thuairim go bhfuil caoi ag na daoine éisteacht le nithe a craoltar ar ghléasanna craolta atá ag déanamh díobháil agus ba chóir dúinn ásáid a bhaint as ár Radio féin chun cur in a gcoinne.</P>

    <P>Aontaím leis an méid adúirt an eachta MacFheórais i dtaobh na Cláracha faoi choimirce.  Chomh fada <Col N="1830" /> is 'a chím níl aon fhocal Gaeilge ná aon amhrán i nGaeilge le cloisint orthu.  Bíonn siad go léir i mBéarla. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil clár faoi choimirce amháin ann ar a mbíonn amhráin agus dánta, ach dánta agus amhráin i mBéarla is ea iad a bhaineas leis an dtír seo.  Ach níl focal amháin Gaeilge le cloisint ar na cláracha seo. Is locht mór é sin.  Ba chóir iachall a chur ar na comhluchtaí a cheannaíonn am ar an Radio roinnt dá chuid ama a thabhairt suas do amhráin i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, ní shílim go bhfuil cláracha fóirstineacha ann chomh fada is a bhaineas le páistí scoile ar chor ar bith.  Sílim féin gur cheart cláracha fá choinne scoláirí, páistí fé bhun 12 bhliain d'aois a shimpliú agus a leathnú. Sílim gur mór an trua nach bhfuil caoi ag na páistí níos mó úsáid a bhaint as an Radio.  Ní orthu atá an locht. Is ar lucht Radio Éireann atá an locht ná cuireann siad cláracha oiriúnacha ar siúl do na páistí.</P>
    <P>Éistím féin leis an Radio tráthnóintí Sathairn agus Domhnaigh.  Measaim féin go mbíonn caoi ag na páistí, thárla ná bíonn mórán obair scoile le déanamh acu, éisteacht leis an Radio an dá oíche sin ach ní bhíonn clír fóirstineach ar siúl dóibh.  Sin é an príomh-phoinnte ar mhaith liom labhairt in a thaobh agus é cur ós comhair an Aire.</P>
    <P>Labhair Teachtaí eile i dtaobh an Radio ach sílim nach bhfuil aon mhaith sa Radio, dá fheabhas é, muna mbaintear úsáid as chun na cluichí Gaelacha, na hamhráin Ghaeilge agus an ceol Gaelach do chur ós cóir na ndaoine agus na nithe sin do choimeád ós a gcómhair gach lá den tseachain.</P>

      <P>In a discussion such as this Deputies are apt to give expression to extreme views in relation to different programmes and to express them in such a manner that it might be possible to identify certain people engaged by Radio Éireann.  I think this is a matter about which we should be very careful, because, after all, we may express views here in relation to these matters that may be quite personal and that may not reflect the general opinion of the people of the country.  In my contribution to <Col N="1831" /> this debate I should like to express the desires of the people whom I meet and try to interpret their views on the various programmes.  I find that other Deputies who have spoken have referred to points that I had intended to make.  With them, I would compliment those responsible for giving us the morning news and extending the time on Radio Éireann.  If we are to arrive at the point where Radio Éireann will take precedence over all other stations for listeners in this country, then we must give to our listeners as much radio time as any other station would give.  However, we have made some progress towards that in recent years.</P>
      <P>In regard to our news items, we should give a little more prominence to news that is of particular interest in this country.  I do not mean that we should be completely insular and that we should not broadcast many of the happenings all over the world, but there are times when we are apt to go into too much detail on these matters.  Recently there was one particular news item which was of great importance to many people in this country.  Several people knew of it but some four items of completely foreign news were given before this item was reached.  I suggest that those responsible should give a little attention to matters like that.</P>
      <P>I consider that the topical talks have been extremely successful.  The matter in them is of interest to most people. That is a matter which the radio authorities should bear in mind when arranging their programmes.  After all, many thousands of people pay every year for the privilege of either being entertained or educated, and we should give very careful thought to providing the majority of them with something in every programme which would be of interest to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some controversy about the type of plays we hear from Radio Éireann.  I am interested on behalf of many of the amateur dramatic societies throughout the country, because they look to the broadcasting of many of these plays for some information <Col N="1832" /> as to their content, as to the type of characters portrayed and the number of characters in them, whether male or female, to see whether it would be possible at some later date, when the rights would be available to them, to present any of these plays.  They like to hear them so that they can come to some conclusion in that respect.  There is no doubt but that some vulgarities have been broadcast in some recent productions, but I do not think that we should condemn the whole idea of presenting these plays in the strong terms which have been used.  Now that such attention has been drawn to the matter, perhaps more care will be exercised in future in regard to them.  There are, however, some people throughout the country who regard with some envy the theatre-goers of Dublin and the larger cities who have the privilege of seeing the new plays, and they would like to hear them on the radio.  Perhaps when they hear them they do not think they are all they thought they were.  But at least that is one way of giving to the people in the more remote districts the facilities which formerly were afforded to those lucky enough to be in proximity to the centres where these plays are produced.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the niggardly expenses paid to amateurs who appear from time to time on the programmes.  There is no doubt that, with travelling costs and hotel expenses as they are to-day, an increase is an absolute necessity if we are not to deter many good artistes from attaining prominence by taking part in plays broadcast from Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Practically all the Deputies who contributed to this debate or to the debates in former years had one complaint in common and that is in relation to interference on the radio.  It is pitiable on many occasions to see very fine programmes arranged and then find that it is impossible to hear them because of local interference.  The radio is intended to transmit to listeners news from foreign parts, but I do not think it was ever intended that they should be made aware through the medium of the radio when the local cinema entertainment ends <Col N="1833" /> or when the local mills are operating. Many people in towns and villages can identify these occurrences over the radio.  Whatever machinery is available to check these interferences should be put into motion to deal with them so that some satisfaction will be given to those who have to pay the increased licence fee.</P>
    <P>I think that whoever is responsible should be commended for the presentation after the news of an account of the proceedings here in Leinster House.  It is an item that many people listen to with interest and the manner in which it is presented is extremely fair.  Perhaps in the course of time we will reach the point when we will have political discussions. If Great Britain and other countries can have them on the radio, why should we not have them?  I am rather loath to refer to this because it has been advocated already by a Deputy who injected a considerable amount of animosity and spleen into his own contribution and, of course, the dread in everybody's mind will be that it might be availed of by somebody to do something similar.  However, I am sure that we can have faith that the leaders on both sides of the House would take part in these discussions in a way that would be very interesting and instructive and educative for the general public.</P>
    <P>I should also like the authorities to recognise the fact that many motorcars to-day are equipped with radio sets.  Perhaps from time to time it would be possible to include in the programme some references which would be of help to such motorists. It might be possible to give warnings which would be of interest to them and perhaps improve matters in regard to road safety.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Defence &ldquo;if he is now prepared to give particulars of the apprenticeship scheme for the Naval Dockyard, Haulbowline, as promised to Cobh Vocational School in his Department's letter of 31st January, 1952.&rdquo;  The Minister, in reply, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The question of the establishment of an apprenticeship scheme in the Naval Dockyard, Haulbowline, is still under consideration.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that until such time as consultations with the different interests involved have taken place it would not be possible to give particulars of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to have consideration of this matter expedited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter because it has dragged on from 1951.  It was raised in this House in January, 1952.  It has been continually raised since by question after question with practically the same reply being given on all occasions, that the other interests were being consulted.</P>
      <P>Apprenticeship in Haulbowline Dockyard is practically a tradition in the town of Cobh.  During the British period some 50 apprentices were taken in each year for training and those apprentices learned their trade well.  I might also say that the vast majority of those men afterwards had a very fine national service record during the Black-and-Tan trouble in this country. One would think, now that we have our own naval base at Haulbowline, that there would be no difficulty in the Government providing the same opportunities to-day for our young people to get trained in skilled trades as were provided by the foreigner, particularly when we find that skilled men for the navy even at present must be recruited from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is holding up this scheme.  My purpose in raising the matter is simply to help out the Minister if I can and to smooth out any difficulties, if such exist.  As one who represents the people of Cobh, I am entitled to know what trade union is raising objections to this scheme. <Col N="1835" /> Each year some 40 to 50 young boys are turned out by the Cobh Technical School and they have to make their way in the world.  There would be an excellent opportunity at the naval dockyard at Haulbowline for training at least 20 of those boys each year as apprentices so that the Irish Navy would not in future be dependent upon getting artisans from another country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am only anxious to help out in any way I can but as one who has represented the people of Cobh for the past 26 years, I cannot understand why those boys have to go abroad each year to learn a trade they could learn at home.  I would ask the Minister to let us know what is in the way, what is stopping this scheme and how soon he hopes to have those obstacles overcome.</P>
    <P>I do not wish, at this late hour, to delay the House on this matter.  I am simply putting the case as I know it, and I am appealing to the Minister to let us have a decision on it.  If there are trade unions objecting, then, as I have said, the people of Cobh are entitled to know what trade union is depriving them of their bread and butter and their young boys of the opportunity of learning their trade.  I am, as I say, putting the case as I know it to the Minister for his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to a certain amount of surprise in respect to the tabling of <Col N="1836" /> this question by Deputy Corry, because, in an interview which I had with him on this subject, I thought that I had fully explained the situation to him.  For that reason, I did not expect that this question was going to be tabled.  I gave him the reply which he has read out.  At the end of that reply, I stated that &ldquo;I am endeavouring to have consideration of this matter expedited.&rdquo;  I want to assure the Deputy that everything that I can do in that respect is being done, but a certain stage must be reached in these discussions.  When that stage is reached, it will be necessary to have consultations with the various trade unions concerned and with the Cork vocational authorities.  No trade union that I am aware of is holding up this question of apprenticeship.  It is purely a matter of administration.  We all know that question of this kind relating to various Departments are put down from time to time without securing an immediately successful reply.  This is a case in point, and it does not mean that the Minister concerned is not endeavouring to do his best to secure the result which the Deputy is seeking. I have been doing that, and I cannot add anything further to it.  As far as I am concerned, I will do everything I can to expedite a decision.  I cannot do any more than that.</P>
