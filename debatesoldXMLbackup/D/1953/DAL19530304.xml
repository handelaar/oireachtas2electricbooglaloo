      <P>As I have explained in reply to several previous questions of this kind, I have no functions in regard to the day-to-day administration of An Fóras Tionscal.  Paragraph 11 of the First Schedule of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, provides for the submission by An Fóras Tionscal of an annual report to be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not think it is desirable that An Fóras Tionscal should be asked to supply information of the kind requested by the Deputy in advance of the presentation of this report.</P>

It was stated on behalf of the association that they would be available to consult and co-operate with my Department on appropriate matters arising from time to time and that the formation of the association would facilitate representation of this country at international conferences of insurance organisations. <Col N="2023" /> The names of the officers of the association were conveyed to me at the same time but I do not think it would be appropriate to furnish these names in reply to a question in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The erection of a turf-burning electricity generating station in the Castlerea area is not included in the present programme of the E.S.B.  I am informed that the quantity of turf surplus to local needs which could be produced in the area would not be sufficient to provide for the operation of a generating station on a reasonably economic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Bord na Móna have considerable quantities of turf on hands at the moment in the Castlerea area, and, further, that they are taking steps to close down a number of bogs in that area due to the fact that they have no market for this excellent machine-won turf?  In view of these facts, would the Minister ask the E.S.B. to reconsider its decision on this question of having a generating station in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total quantity of turf produced there under the special schemes operated by Bord na Móna is 15,000 tons, which would be altogether inadequate for the requirements of a generating station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Bord na Móna have not been working the seven bogs in that locality even to half capacity and that consequently it should be possible for them to step up production to at least 30,000 tons a year?  That figure, I suggest, would give reasonable grounds for the erection of a turf-generating station in the Castlerea area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in preparation for their demolition, certain unsound buildings in Dublin Castle had been vacated in 1948 by the Civil Service staffs and whether accommodation for these staffs had been found elsewhere; and, further, whether the staffs in question were subsequently compelled to reoccupy the unsound, unsuitable and unhealthy buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1948, certain buildings in the Lower Castle Yard, which it was intended to <Col N="2025" /> demolish in connection with the first stage of the proposed reconstruction scheme, were vacated by the occupying personnel for whom alternative accommodation, which they still occupy, was provided.  Subsequent to the decision of the then Government that the reconstruction scheme should not be proceeded with, the need arose for the provision of accommodation for other staffs and although, as previously indicated in a reply to another question, none of the buildings referred to could really be described as sound, and although they were unsuitable as permanent premises for Government Departments, it was found necessary, owing to the difficulties of the accommodation position, to have them reoccupied by these staffs.  Prior to re-occupation, an appreciable amount of repair and improvement work was carried out at the buildings, and while, as a result, working conditions have been made reasonably comfortable, the basic defects due to age and unsuitability of lay-out remain.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works advise me that there is only one Irish firm of bentwood chairs in the State.  They had been asked on several occasions to produce a chair of slightly superior quality to what is known as the common bentwood chair, but without satisfactory result. The subject was again raised in connection with the chairs now in question and every effort was made to induce them to make chairs even reasonably close to the required design.  The senior member of the firm finally decided that it would be uneconomic to set up the special plant that would be necessary to manufacture the chairs and recommended that they be imported.</P>

      <P>The Trade Agreement with Britain, signed on the 31st July, 1948, had an initial validity of four years from that date; thereafter it continues in force until the expiry of six months' notice of termination by either party.  Notice of termination has not been given by either party. The final part of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that on the night of 16th February, 1953, when a serious fire broke out at Cloghan, County Offaly, it was not possible for members of the public seeking to telephone for the fire brigade to secure admittance to the local Garda station; and, if so, whether <Col N="2035" /> he will state what steps he proposes to take to ensure that in future this station will be open in similar emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cloghan station had to be closed on the night in question because the strength of the station party had been reduced by illness from four to two and it was impossible (owing to the shortage of man power) to provide replacements for the two absentees or to maintain a 24-hour service with the reduced strength. In accordance with the usual practice when a station is closed, a card was placed inside the window on the ground floor saying where the sergeant could be found.  The caller who arrived at the station at 11.30 p.m. to telephone for a fire brigade to extinguish a fire in the chimney of his house, which was situated some three miles away from the station, apparently failed to see this card and instead of going to the local post office, where there is a 24-hour telephone service, he went to Ferbane Garda station.  The Ferbane and Tullamore fire brigades were summoned but the fire had been extinguished before they arrived and no serious damage was done.</P>
      <P>On the general question of affording the public facilities for telephoning from Garda stations I would refer the Deputy to the answer given on the 4th December, 1951, as reported in the Parliamentary Debates in reply to a similar question by him concerning the same station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claims of genuine evicted tenants or their personal representatives are always considered in competition with the claims of other applicants.  The applicant in question is not an evicted tenant, nor the representative of an evicted tenant, under the terms of the Land Acts.  He was not interviewed as he resides four or five miles from the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the usual practice of the Land Commission to investigate the merits or demerits of every applicant for land?  Surely the Minister is aware that when an estate is to be divided it is open to local smallholders, cottage tenants, Old I.R.A. men, evicted tenants and representatives of evicted tenants to have their cases investigated by the local inspector for submission to the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <P>The Land Commission information is available.  I presume that at some time he gave this information. In any case, the information is in the Land Commission, and I have no reason to doubt it.  If the Deputy doubts it, well and good. Quite a number of people think they are evicted tenants, but to be an evicted tenant under the terms of the Land Acts, the 1923 Act defines an evicted tenant as a person who, within 25 years before the passing of the Irish Land Act of 1903, was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Purchase Acts apply and who was evicted from that holding in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord, or, in case such person is dead, a person nominated by the Land Commission as his personal representative.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the total capital expenditure on the establishment of all State forests to date, not including Appropriations-in-Aid, and the estimated present-day value of our State's forests and the total proceeds to date of sales of timber of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what is meant by capital expenditure. The gross expenditure on forestry (including allied services) up to the 31st March, 1952, and excluding (1) the balance on hands of £26,238 in Land Acquisition (Grant-in-Aid) Fund on that date and (2) expenditure on grants to private persons and public bodies amounted to £7,528,733.  Separate figures for receipts from sales of timber are not readily available but the receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid under all heads to the 31st March, 1952, amounted to £1,384,552.  No reliable estimate of present-day value of the State forests is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted an approximate figure and I am sure the <Col N="2041" /> Minister could get that from the Department.  There must be an approximate figure somewhere of the value of the forests and properties they have on hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say it is not possible to give such a figure.  The matter has received some attention. We have not the staff and, as the Deputy is probably aware, we are not able to set aside a special staff for the purpose of dealing with the task of valuing all the existing plantations. Nobody can tell what the value of timber will be in 30 years or 40 years' time.  It seems to me that the precedent established in Britain of taking the amount of money spent as the basis of estimates or calculations is probably the most serviceable one to follow but the matter is not being lost sight of.</P>

    <P>During the period of approximately five months from the 30th September, 1952 to 20th February, 1953, 2,044 tons were supplied.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, large quantities of thinnings put on the market by the Department would have reached Messrs.  Athy Wallboard through other channels.  Particulars of the quantities of such material reaching the firm are not available but my information is that the quantity has decreased in recent months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That decrease is said to be due to stocking up in the first place.  I understand there has been a stockpile in the industry over the past few years.  That is one reason for the decrease.  The other reason is that business has possibly decreased due to some decline in building activity.  I cannot say that these are the reasons for the lower purchases but they are the reasons that have been given to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £695,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
      <P>In moving the Defence Estimates for 1952/53, I pointed out that a sum of £928,000 had been provided for warlike stores, including naval requirements. I also informed the House that contracts to the value of about £850,000 had at that time been placed for suitable warlike stores and that negotiations had been opened for the purchase of additional supplies.  In replying to the Debate, I envisaged the possibility of a Supplementary Estimate being necessary, because of the fact that the supply position had eased and that there were, therefore, grounds for hoping that suitable extra stores would be obtainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in effect, has proved to be the <Col N="2061" /> position, and while the Supplementary Estimate which I have just moved relates to a number of things in addition to warlike stores, it will be seen that the provision for warlike stores is the heaviest item in the Estimate and that, in fact, the Supplementary Estimate would be unnecessary were it not for that item.</P>
    <P>As regards the additional sum required under sub-head P for warlike stores, which is £860,000, I may, perhaps, say that in 1951 it was found necessary to explore the possibility of obtaining warlike stores on the Continent and, as a result, contracts to the value of £850,000, approximately, were, as I have said, placed during 1951/52 with continental armaments firms.  Payments in the present financial year on foot of deliveries under these contracts will amount to approximately £550,000.  Deliveries have been proceeding satisfactorily and will, it is expected, be completed in April or May next.</P>
    <P>During the past year it was found possible to negotiate further contracts to the value of £2,786,000 with continental and British firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments on foot of these contracts will amount to £1,115,000 in the present financial year. The equipment purchased includes anti-aircraft guns and sub-machine guns from Sweden, anti-tank grenades from Belgium, mortars from France and small arms ammunition from England. I should like to emphasise that this equipment is the product of Europe's foremost manufacturers of armaments and the weapons are basic equipment in most armies to-day.  In selecting new weapons for purchase, careful consideration has been given not only to the intrinsic merits of each type but also to its suitability in relation to the existing pattern of equipment in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure may appear to be high, but in terms of modern armaments it must be considered reasonable.  It should be remembered that for some years past expenditure on warlike <Col N="2062" /> stores was relatively small due to the difficulty of obtaining supplies, and that position, I think, judging by the references made to it from time to time, was a matter of regret to all Parties.  It is satisfactory to know that, after so many difficulties, we are now in the position to give the Defence Forces reasonable supplies of up-to-date arms and equipment.  The effect on training and morale has already been very valuable.</P>
    <P>As to the remainder of the Estimate, an additional sum of £15,981 is required under sub-head B&mdash;Marriage Allowance&mdash;for the reason that, as a result of regulations which amended the ages and service qualifying soldiers for admission to the married establishment, a larger number than that originally provided for has been so admitted.  Under sub-head E&mdash;Pay of Officers of Medical Service, etc.&mdash; an additional sum of £4,500 is likewise required, the number of medical officers recruited during the year having exceeded the number originally anticipated.  An additional sum of £48,648 is provided for under sub-head K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in Lieu. A number of factors contribute to this &mdash;the principal ones being the increased cost of food supplies and the average strengh having proved to be greater than the original estimate. The cost of petrol and aviation spirit has increased, and the consumption has been somewhat greater than expected, and, for those reasons, it has been found necessary to provide for a further sum of £24,000 under sub-head L&mdash;Petrol and Oils.  Barrack repairs, renewals and maintenance have also proved to be more expensive than expected, and, accordingly.  an additional sum of £20,000, which takes account of savings absorbed in the sub-head, has been provided in sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and Minor Works.  An additional sum of £3,000, which also takes into account savings absorbed in the sub-head, U&mdash; provided for under sub-head U&mdash; Compensation&mdash;in respect of the acquisition of land.  The increased employers' contributions under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, necessitate an additional £10,000 under sub-head <Col N="2063" /> W&mdash;Insurance&mdash;and the increased charges for telephones an additional £5,000 under sub-head X (1)&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones.</P>
    <P>The total of the sums I have mentioned is £991,129, but this is reduced by an anticipated net increase of £20,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid.  There are also anticipated savings in other sub-heads, amounting in all to £276,129 so that the Supplementary Estimate is for a sum of £695,000.  As I have already pointed out, by far the heaviest item, and the one making the Supplementary Estimate necessary, is the provision relating to warlike stores.  I feel sure that, in view of the indication I have given of the type of stores being purchased, and their value to the Defence Forces, the House will have no objection to agreeing to this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were looking for evidence of the increased cost of living generally, I think we could not have got a better statement than that which was made by the Minister.  There is not a single item in regard to the ordinary day-to-day maintenance of the Army which has not increased to an alarming extent.  When that increase is experienced in a Department in respect of which tenders, contracts and everything else are entered into to get food and clothing at the cheapest possible price, we see just exactly where we are going.</P>
      <P>There are many points in connection with the Estimate introduced by the Minister which strike one.  First of all, we are now told that the contracts entered into for warlike stores&mdash;some of them in 1951&mdash;are now being paid for. I have reason to believe that there were substantial payments on account in 1951.  Before there would even be consent to go on with the contracts, payment had to be made, but the Minister has not told us anything about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to know that some supplies are being made available.  In my opinion it is fantastic to have an army and have no suitable equipment for it.  At the present day we have a bigger Army.  I think we have more in <Col N="2064" /> the standing Army than is necessary. I have been for a long time a firm believer in the development of the F.C.A. and the continuance and maintenance of that force in a very efficient manner.  We should have it well trained and if we had the nucleus of our training cadre to make that more efficient the money spent on it would be well spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us&mdash;it does not arise on this Estimate&mdash;what the position is in regard to the F.C.A.&mdash; whether it is being developed or whether any or much of this equipment ought to be diverted to it.  The fact of the matter is that we have more men than are required.  It is true to say that when the inter-Party Government were in office they built in 1950-51 upon a three years' period of peace&mdash;that we had at least two or three years before war was likely to take place.  Of course, it was argued that we were taking a very grave risk but we had come to that conclusion from the information at our disposal and from the best inquiries that could be made.  The fact that we were right is some justification for our action. When we consider the attacks that were made upon us for failure to have the Army kept up to a certain figure, we now know it was mostly propaganda and that the Government, through the Minister, had to make some effort when it came into office to bring the Army up to the numbers they suggested were necessary.</P>
    <P>To be quite candid, I never really understood why it takes such a huge amount of money to run the mechanised end of the Army.  I note that, for the small Army we have, it costs now £79,130 for petrol and oil alone.  The details given state that the amount includes an increase of £5,062 for the Air Corps.  So the Air Corps on its petrol and oil spends only £5,000&mdash;which is much greater than normal expenditure would be, as it is necessary to give them the air training they require, and that costs more than the other transport we utilise.</P>
    <P>The whole Estimate shows the manner in which the cost of living is affecting the Army, just the same as it <Col N="2065" /> affects ordinary people.  I always feel there is nothing we can do with an Estimate like this but hope that we are getting the best material that can be got, that we are not depending on obsolete stuff.  I am glad the Minister is satisfied with what he is getting and that it has raised the morale of the Army generally.  To ask them to train on obsolete material would be lowering to the morale so if we have good material for them it will go a long distance towards keeping up the spirit we would like to see maintained in the Army of the State.  We can let this Estimate go through, in the hope that the intention of the Government and the people for the defence of the nation will be maintained and kept up to the proper standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear we have to pay £1,000,000 this year for war supplies.  I would reiterate what I said before, that it is time we tried to manufacture some of these things in some of our factories.  Is it not a strange position for any country to be depending on outside sources for war materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is alarming also that we have to pay £1,000,000 for war stores while we have so many people in need of the bare necessities of life.  I often wonder if we have sufficiently considered the possibility of having a small, efficient Army and developing the Volunteer force.  We have 87,000 unemployed and we have old age pensioners trying to live on 21/- a week.  In such circumstances, it is hard to agree to voting £1,000,000 for Army equipment.  I will be told I have no sense of responsibility, as we must defend the country, but I am not so satisfied that we are defending it in the best way in spending so much on the Army and paying so little attention to the army of £87,000 that will not be allowed to work to produce the goods and services of the country.  I suggest to the Minister or to anyone else that an army of 87,000 standing idle, compelled to be unemployed, is as much a danger as any outside force likely to invade the country.  Let us remember that, within Ireland, in the Six Counties there are 52,000 unemployed and that, added <Col N="2066" /> to the 87,000 here, gives us a very large army of unemployed.  Is that not an army of very doubtful security in this country?  I am not going to look at it from the viewpoint of Deputy MacEoin, as an indication of the cost of living.  That is not the way to approach a matter of this kind.  We know that prices have gone up for Army supplies, but we do not seem to pay any attention to the unemployed army.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, I am relating this £1,000,000 to keep out an outside invader, to the greatest danger I see, the 87,000 unemployed army within the country, without means of supporting themselves and their dependents.  It is time we thought more seriously about these matters.  In conclusion, I suggest again that we have sufficient factories and that some of them should be turned to making some equipment, instead of our depending on outside countries for Army supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate and also the Minister's statement that he has been able to get up-to-date equipment.  Those members of the House who were invited by the general staff to be present recently at a demonstration of modern arms will agree that we were very pleased with the demonstration and with the supply of equipment&mdash;particularly those automatic weapons or sub-machine guns and the anti-tank weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that was frightening to us in this country was the fear of a tank invasion and we were all delighted to see that, with the equipment <Col N="2067" /> the Defence Forces now have, they are able to stop any tank.  I am not surprised to hear the Minister saying that, by virtue of this new equipment and these new arms, the morale of the Defence Forces is higher than it has been for a long time.  I felt very proud of our position when I saw armour-piercing anti-tank weapons, with their wonderful efficiency and their power to demolish or destroy a very heavily-armoured tank.  It was the one type of weapon we wanted in this country and I am perfectly certain that everyone who was privileged to see the demonstration was delighted with the achievements and delighted that our Army has been made so effective by means of this new equipment.  Although we may be a small Army, small in numbers, with that equipment and the other new equipment, we have a much more powerful Army than we have ever had and an Army which can certainly make a stand, and a very gallant stand, against superior numbers, if the test should come at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>For many years, we felt, particularly those of us who were in the Defence Forces, that we had not the equipment which would enable us to face these new modern implements of war and it is wonderful that new inventions have given to us a power that is out of all proportion to the size of our country and the numbers of our Defence Forces. The country can feel, for the first time, that it has a really effective Defence Force, a force which can defend its interests against anything but the most overwhelming odds.  There is no use in having an Army or a Defence Force, unless it is fit to fight, and, whatever it costs to provide that Defence Force with this type of equipment, which is simple and easily moved from place to place&mdash;it can be carried by individual soldiers&mdash;the necessary equipment should be secured, because, while we have a sufficient amount of that equipment, our Army is a more powerful force than it has ever been in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin has suggested that our standing Army is too large.  That is a matter of opinion and Deputy MacEoin is entitled to that viewpoint, but I think experience has shown that <Col N="2068" /> the number mentioned by the Minister as the minimum is in fact the minimum that will enable the permanent force to carry out its functions and enable it to administer and train the non-permanent force, to provide the number of instructors, administrative staffs and so on that will be required to make the Defence Forces effective and efficient.  I think we have reached a position where on a matter of that kind, we have to be guided by the advice of our own general staff.  The Minister has told us from time to time that that is the advice of the general staff and there is not very much opportunity for disagreement with them.  It might be a matter of a few hundred or a couple of thousand, but in the long run the responsibility rests on the general staff, and, if we have a general staff in whom we have confidence and if they are not entirely extravagant in their demands, it is reasonable that their professional and technical views should be accepted by the Government and by the House.  I do not think it ought to be a matter for debate whether we have 12,000, 11,000, 10,000 or 9,000 men.</P>
    <P>Obviously when we spend the amount of money we are spending on the Defence Forces, we have to consider what is the purpose for which we are spending this money.  Deputy MacEoin has referred to the fact that a couple of years ago there was criticism here of the then Government for not taking adequate steps to defend the country in the event of war. Fortunately, the clouds of war which then hovered over the world seem to be dispersing somewhat and I think that responsible opinion all over the world is satisfied that a war could only occur to-morrow by a clash between the Russians and the Americans. Responsible opinion also believes that, so far as the Russians are concerned, they do not want war, that, without war, they are consolidating their position and extending the areas under Communist control.  Obviously, therefore, it would be senseless on the part of the Russians to want or to bring about war.</P>
    <P>The other major force are the Americans, and if there is one lesson <Col N="2069" /> to be learned from the result of the recent presidential election in America it is that the American people do not want war.  There was a change of president on a promise by him that he would bring the soldiers home from Korea.  He was put into power on that promise; in other words, on the desire of the ordinary American people to get away from war.  It, therefore, seems to me, anyway&mdash;I hope I am assessing the position rightly&mdash;that the dangers of war are much more remote now than they were a couple of years back and for that the world, and certainly this country, ought to be thankful.</P>
    <P>A nice problem does arise.  There are, as one may term it, these two great powers engaged at the moment in a cold war.  There is the other great power with which we have been in conflict for a long period&mdash;the British Commonwealth or the British Empire.</P>

      <P>It is the best case that could possibly be made for it. There is an old saying that it is too late to sharpen your sword when the drum beats for battle: you must have it sharpened well in advance.  I think that that is what the Minister is doing: he is sharpening the sword.  While the world, to some extent, has gone made we are one of those nations who desire to be neutral and to keep out of conflict. We are still one of the many nations that adopted the line of neutrality, the line of steering clear of entanglement with either America or Russia.  My desire was to express the hope that this nation with which we have had so many conflicts in the past and that lives so near us&mdash;the British Commonwealth&mdash;will organise those neutral nations together as a sort of third force or barrier to endeavour to prevent those major powers&mdash;America and Russia&mdash;from involving the world in war.  I realise that I shall probably get an opportunity of speaking on this at greater length again but I think that it is within the ambit of this particular Supplementary Estimate and I think there is nothing wrong in expressing that hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has touched on an old point and one which has often been mentioned in this House&mdash;the making of our own munitions. Obviously that would be grand if we could do it.  In so far as we can possibly make our own munitions we should do so but there are technical as well as other difficulties in the way. I am glad to see that Deputy Major de Valera is in the House because nobody more than he understands and appreciates not only the possibilities but the difficulties in that regard.  I believe that it is the desire of the Minister, as it has been the desire of all the Ministers we have had in the past, to establish our own factories for the manufacture of our own munitions and instruments of defence. I realise, just as the members of the House realise, that there are substantial difficulties, but nevertheless I do not think the matter is being overlooked <Col N="2071" /> and certainly it ought not be overlooked.  Anything we can do in regard to the manufacture or provision of our own munitions should be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey mentioned also what he described as &ldquo;the reserve of revolt&rdquo; in the country.  There is a large number of unemployed in this part of the country and in the Six Northern Counties.  We have had a large number of unemployed in this country for many years.  The number is higher now than it has been for some time.  I think, however, that Deputy Hickey was drawing considerably on his imagination when he referred to them as the &ldquo;reserve of revolt.&rdquo;  I often wished that they were the reserve of revolt but I was disappointed.  I hope that those of them who are within the military age will be induced to become members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister has opened up a recruiting campaign recently in which excellent conditions of service are made available for young people&mdash; particularly for young people who have not the benefit of a trade or the benefit of training in any particular profession.  I think the military profession gives an excellent opportunity to those young men&mdash;and there are quite a number of them in the country, and have been for years&mdash;of spending a few years in the Army service under a paternal form of discipline.  I hope that the Minister and his advisers will be able to make provision for the training of these young boys for civilian life so that, when their term of Army service expires, they will be able to return to civilian life trained and fitted to take up the employment which I hope will then be available for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, as a mere civilian, raise a few points on the Estimate itself?  The Supplementary Estimate is made up almost entirely of a sum required under the heading of &ldquo;Warlike Stores&rdquo;.  Incidentally, may I say that I think the description given in the smaller print immediately under that sub-head&mdash;&ldquo;Miscellaneous defensive equipment&rdquo;&mdash;is more appropriate than &ldquo;Warlike Stores&rdquo;.  Apart from an <Col N="2072" /> additional sum of £860,000 which is now required under sub-head P&mdash;&ldquo;Warlike Stores&rdquo;&mdash;there are a few other sub-heads to which I should like to advert very briefly.  Most of the increases in the other sub-heads arise out of the increase in prices following on the Budget of last year and that applies, in particular, to petrol, oils and food. Under sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and Minor Works&mdash;an additional sum of £20,000 is required for ordinary repairs, renewals and maintenance of barracks throughout the country.  That gives a total under that sub-head of £130,000.  I am taking this opportunity of raising the matter and of asking the Minister&mdash;because obviously I do not know&mdash;whether it is necessary, for Army purposes, for the Army to retain all the military barracks that are spread throughout the country having regard, particularly, to the change in Army equipment, Army training and the mechanisation of the Army.</P>
      <P>I have found, too, that quite a number of those barracks are rarely, if ever, used.  They may be used occasionally by the F.C.A.  I think, however, that they must involve the Department in very heavy charges for maintenance.  If they are not maintained and kept properly then, of course, it would be better for the Army to get rid of them altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that that aspect of the matter was brought home to me very forcibly on more than one occasion when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I found then that local development associations or persons proposing to engage in manufacture, often came to the Department to discuss the use of a barracks or portion of a barracks as a ready-made factory premises at a reasonable rent or purchase price.  Invariably, the reply which came back from the Army authorities was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  They indicated that that could not be done or said they required the barracks.  If there is an absolute necessity for the retention of these barracks by the Army authorities then, of course, that is all right.  I want, as I have said, when dealing with matters relating to the Army, to qualify it by admitting that I am speaking entirely out of the <Col N="2073" /> depths of my ignorance.  It does seem to me, however, that the changes in the Army&mdash;its mechanisation, and the whole Army routine&mdash;must, of necessity, involve important changes in the disposition of troops throughout the country.  I should be glad if the Minister could tell us something about that and, if not now, that he would look into it and see if anything can be done about it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I must raise on this Supplementary Estimate.  In doing so I propose to take advantage of the sub-head for the Appropriations-in-Aid. This matter has been mentioned before, both publicly and privately, and has been brought to the attention of the Minister and of his predecessor. Despite that, I do not know that anything has ever been done about it.  My opinion is that something should be done about it.  Under the Appropriations-in-Aid we find this item: &ldquo;Sale of surplus stores and unserviceable clothing, £12,300.&rdquo;  What I want to draw attention to is the way in which the Department of Defence disposes of its surplus stores.  I understand that it is generally done by public auction. I have no complaint whatever to find with that.  But the Department itself, I understand, not only drafts the advertisements, but fixes the conditions of sale.  The advertisements inform the public that, when an article is knocked down to the highest bidder, the highest bidder is to pay that sum for the particular article or commodity plus 5 per cent. auctioneer's commission.</P>
    <P>That is where I take issue on this matter, because although the citizen or the purchaser has to pay 5 per cent. auctioneer's commission, and although it is conveyed in the advertisement that he will have to pay that 5 per cent. auctioneer's commission for and to the auctioneer, the fact is that the auctioneer does not get the 5 per cent. He may not even get 2 per cent. under the system that is operated by the Department of Defence, so that the Department of Defence puts the difference between the 5 per cent. it takes from the citizen or purchaser over and above the market value of the article and disposes of it itself in <Col N="2074" /> the Department.  I do not want to be misunderstood when I say that.  It disposes of it, of course, in a legitimate way for a legitimate purpose, but my contention is that the Department of Defence, as a Department of State particularly, has no right, under a public advertisement relating to a public sale, to take from a purchaser 5 per cent. in the guise of auctioneer's commission when, in fact, there is not 5 per cent. auctioneer's commission and when the auctioneer does not get 5 per cent. commission.  I think that is wrong.  It is doubly wrong when the auctioneer does not get the 5 per cent. and, of course. it is much worse that he should get the name of getting it when, in fact, the Department itself collars the lion's share of it.  I think the Department should not do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department can get auctioneers to dispose of their property at 2½ per cent commission, I have no objection to that, provided that is all the purchaser is made pay by way of commission.  However, the Minister knows all about this.  It has been brought to his notice over and over again.  I do seriously suggest that there is something wrong in a Department of State taking from a citizen or a purchaser a sum over and above the market value of the article, and taking it in a way which, to say the least of it, is not open.</P>

      <P>If they were to give double or treble the amount to the Army Benevolent Fund I would still object to an advertisement which says that the articles offered will be knocked down to the highest bidder plus 5 per cent. auctioneer's commission, when in fact, that is not so.  I object to the <Col N="2075" /> auctioneer or the purchaser being told even by implication that the one is to pay 5 per cent. auctioneer's commission and that the other is to receive it when in fact that does not happen.  If the Minister were prepared to make it clear that 2½ of the 5 per cent. was to go to the auctioneer, and that the other 2½ per cent. was to go to the Army Benevolent Fund, I would have no objection to that.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House further on this supplementary Vote talking about a number of matters that I have very little knowledge of.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like a number of other Deputies, cannot but feel amazed at the fact that we should be presented with a Supplementary Estimate for such a large sum.  It would now appear that, in addition to the sums already voted for Army supplies, we have now to foot a bill for £24,000 additional because of the fact that there has been an increase in the <Col N="2076" /> price of petrol.  The impact of that on the vehicles in the Irish Army would lead us to believe that the impact on business must be quite considerable.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the situation caused by the increase in food for the Army.  For telegrams and telephones the additional sum required is £5,000.  This additional expenditure can be attributed to the last Budget. The Minister also proposes to expend a considerable sum on equipment in the present year.  He mentioned the sum of £1,115,000.</P>
      <P>There is some little difference of opinion as to the numbers we should have in the standing Army.  Some of us feel that 12,000, the figure that has been mentioned from the other side of the House, is rather on the large side. There are many Deputies who disagree with that.</P>
      <P>We feel that more attention should be given to the Second Line Reserve. There are many men in productive employment in the country who rendered very valuable service during the emergency, who learned a good deal of military warfare and who, whether in the Reserve or attached to the F.C.A., would be available if the country were in danger.  In that respect it is a very sad feature that so many men who were trained in this country at considerable expense and who would be of infinite value to us were the occasion to arise, have been lost to the country.  How many of us in the course of the past few years have had to sign forms certifying that these men had given up equipment that had been issued to them so that they would be allowed to depart?  How many of them are to-day in the American Army and the British Army all over the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a situation where there are unemployed a considerable number of men who had given service during the emergency and who are to-day in the F.C.A. we should bend our efforts towards putting those men into productive employment and should apply all the money that comes for disposal in this House in that direction.  Unless we arrest the present <Col N="2077" /> tide of emigration we will lose many of these lads who are of infinite value to the country, whether in the production of essential goods or in defence, in the event of an emergency.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £1,115,000 is for anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns, small arms and ammunition&mdash;all designed for the Regular Defence Forces.  Our Second Line Reserve are not trained in these weapons so there is no indication there that there is any large-scale development to be expected in that direction.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister to dispose of Army huts to the F.C.A. to as great an extent as possible and to provide amenities in far flung areas where lads could meet weekly for training.  As much attention as possible should be given to summer camps and winter courses and men should be encouraged to avail of these facilities and the requirement should be rigidly adhered to, that a certain period of training should be done in local training centres.  If we direct our attention more to that matter and keep these men in their normal avocations, on the farm or in industry, and at the same time afford them an opportunity of becoming trained in military affairs it will be far better than expending an immense amount of money on the purchase of warlike stores which may become obsolete in a short time.</P>
    <P>Even though it is conceded that, in the normal course, these are moneys which must be met by the House, we feel that in the present circumstances we are spending too much money in directions that are unproductive in view of the fact that there are only about 24 per cent. of the people in productive employment at the moment.</P>

      <P>This is the first of a bunch of 11 Supplementary Estimates which we discuss to-day, after we have received notice that we are to discuss four more to-morrow and they are all introduced by a Government which nine months ago was telling us that they had not enough money to pay the civil servants.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will remember that we then <Col N="2078" /> described such representations as being fraudulent, political stunting and I think it ought to be manifest to all and sundry now that if the Government had not got the wherewithal to pay the civil servants ten months ago, they could not in conscience bring in Supplementary Estimates to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, no.  Let us not ride off on that.  We had a Budget day before us and we were told that the Minister was imposing additional heavy taxes which would just barely meet the demands that that Budget laid upon him.  If that was so one would imagine that his business for the last ten months would have been the instruction of all his fellow Ministers in the simple lesson that they would have to cut their cloth according to the measure of their Estimates, that he would bring in no Supplementary Estimates for there was no money.  We told the House then that he was budgeting for £10,000,000 surplus which he is now in these Supplementary Estimates preparing to spend.  That is the first interesting feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing is: I want to ask the Minister for Defence, who is the Minister of an Irish Government, whatever Party he belongs to, on behalf of the Irish Government to repudiate the disgusting doctrine enunciated by Deputy Cowan to-day.  I am prepared in times of emergency to face the question of a conscript Army in which young men will be called from every walk of life on a roster of equal <Col N="2079" /> priority to serve in the Army if that necessity should arise.  I am prepared and prefer to have a volunteer Army in which those prepared to serve are asked to come forward and to give as many years as their circumstances will permit to voluntary service in the Army.</P>
    <P>But, there is one thing that every Party in this House rejects as unthinkable and that is a pauperate in which you drive a certain element of the community into the ranks of the Army with the instrument of unemployment and starvation.  I understood Deputy Cowan to say that he noted that the figures for unemployment stood higher to-day than they have stood for many years and his suggestion to the people who were unemployed was that they should go into the Army.  Those who want to make their career in the Army would be welcome in the Army on their merits, employed or unemployed, but I would be long sorry to say to any young man in this country that any Party in this House would desire to see men forced into the Army by the alternative of unemployment and starvation. I do not believe that is the policy of the Government and certainly it is not the policy of this Party.  I think it would be apt if the Minister would reiterate that this Oireachtas has determined on a volunteer Army in the fullest sense of that word, that those who volunteer for it are honoured members of the community and that there is no intention in this Oireachtas now or hereafter to drive any section of our people into the ranks of the Army through the instrumentality of engineered unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to advert to the sub-heads K, L, and X in each of which the increases are described as being in large part due to the increased cost of rations, the increase in the price of petrol and the increased charge for telephones.  When a Department of State comes in collision with these consequences of the Budget of 1952, it has a very simple way of meeting them, that is, to ask the responsible Minister to introduce a Supplementary Estimate and in that way get the money to pay these increased charges.  There is not <Col N="2080" /> a citizen in this State who does not have to buy food.  There are many thousands of our people living in rural Ireland who depend for the illumination of their kitchens on paraffin oil.  There are many thousands of people who have to use the telephone in the ordinary course of their business.  None of these can have recourse to the simple procedure of introducing a Supplementary Estimate in Dáil Eireann.  The only means they have of meeting charges of that kind is to do with less food, less petrol and less telephoning.  Most people can get on all right by reducing their telephone calls, their petrol and their paraffin oil.  They can go to bed an hour earlier, but it is a bad thing that our people are driven by their own Government to do with less food, and I think the Minister ought to look at his own Estimate and think well on the impact of these difficulties with which he has to contend as Minister for Defence on the humble citizen of this State who has not got at his disposal the Minister's financial get-out of this dilemma of increased costs.</P>
    <P>I come now to the last matter that I would like the Minister to elaborate when he is winding up.  When he told us that he wanted an increased sum of £260,000 for defensive equipment, he mentioned also a sum of £2,000,000. Frankly, I lost the thread of his discourse then.  He spoke of contracts laid in 1951-1952 which, I think, he spoke of as amounting to £2,100,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as the total appropriation for warlike stores in 1952-53 comes to £1,710,000 the sum for next year will probably be in the order of £1,000,000.  I would like to think that these warlike stores were more truly described in the note to the sub-head where they are referred to as defensive equipment because the more I reflect on this matter the more convinced I am that every rational person in this State would be very much easier in his mind if he felt that the outlay on defensive equipment represented the purchase of effective equipment for a commando or a guerilla type of force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that if we seek to equip our Army with artillery and heavy equipment of the tank and heavy transport character, which is an essential element in the equipment of modern European armies, that equipment will be obsolete and ripe for destruction within 12 or 18 months of its delivery here.  Unless we can hold out to our Army a clear prospect of replacing this type of equipment with every development of obsolescence that transpires it is the merest illusion to be laying out hundreds of thousands or millions of pounds on buying equipment which almost on delivery is obsolete and should be in the process of replacement when it is perfectly manifest that the resources of this State can never maintain an adequate programme of the replacement of obsolescent equipment if we attempt to emulate the type of equipment ordinarily used by a European army.  It will be quite otherwise if we resolve that the equipment for our Army should be of the very best on the basis of a commando and guerilla trained force.  We could then say to our Army with a clear conscience and in the knowledge that we could make good our undertaking that we accepted the proposition that all their defensive equipment must be deemed to be starting on the road to obsolescence on the date of its delivery and that <Col N="2082" /> it is our firm intention to maintain a constant stream of replacement with the most modern versions of commando equipment they can have for their use.</P>
    <P>There is no use concealing the fact that as a layman looking at this whole Army question from the outside of the Army, as indeed every taxpayer in the State is entitled to do, the question of equipment causes me the gravest possible concern.  I cannot conceive that our Army can be content with any less than the best.  I am satisfied from my knowledge of the personnel and the spirit of that personnel in the Army that they are prepared to give of their best.  I think it is historically manifest that the regiments manned by our people in every army of the world have been in the very front rank of performance. I am convinced that it is no vain ambition to aspire to make the Irish Army the best of its kind in the world.  Anything less is a quite unworthy objective for this Oireachtas to aim at.</P>
    <P>However, if they are to be the best in the world, the Army must be given the opportunity of acting on a basis where we would be able to provide them with the equipment to function as efficiently as it is humanly possible to do.  We cannot do that if we attempt to set up in this country a toy army on the lines of the European army because our resources do not extend to it.  We can, in my opinion, establish, maintain and equip an army second to none in the world for the very highly specialised task of defending the sovereignty of this State against any external threat if we accept the fundamental principle that the limitations imposed by our resources require our Army to be a guerilla commando formation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reflect on this, that the danger against which we have to guard is invasion, that it is now common case amongst all small countries in the world that the resistance to invasion by a great power single-handed is not possible.  Therefore, what a small nation's army must do is to defend the sovereignty of the State until its allies can be deployed to assist it in resistance to aggression. <Col N="2083" /> What our Army's function in the time of invasion must be is to constitute a citadel within which the sovereign independence of this State can be preserved for the Irish people until such time as Ireland with her allies can deploy forces to drive out whatever aggressor has succeeded in securing a foothold in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>But the big defect of merely relying on that is that the opposing forces get in all over the country.  However, I do not want to start a discussion on it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a thesis pretty generally accepted all over the world that with the modern method of invasion, shown at the successful invasion of the island of Crete, plus the successful invasion of Normandy, plus the successful invasion of North Africa, plus the counter invasion across the Mediterranean to Tunis, it is perfectly idle for anyone but a power of the first class to contemplate preventing another power of the first class securing a foothold on your coastline, more especially when your coastline is so greatly disproportionate to your hinterland, as is the case in a small island like ours.  If it is impossible to defeat them on the beaches, the next thing is to try to maintain the sovereignty of the State until such time as irresistible forces can be deployed against the aggressor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the purpose, as I see it, of the Irish Army and I think it is an illusion to ask the Army to undertake an assignment greater than that because whatever the values of the personnel of that Army may be, it is not within our power to give them the equipment effectively to deploy against the equipment of a modern European <Col N="2084" /> army <i>en masse.</i>  Their only hope is to take advantage of the terrain and the friendliness of our people to them as opposed to the aggressor and their ability to hold out by avoiding strategy and by wrecking strategy on the aggressive forces.</P>
    <P>I know there are Deputies in this House who will say: &ldquo;What is the use of bothering our heads with that kind of thing?  What do we know about it.&rdquo; The answer is that this is the Parliament of Ireland and it is our duty to lay down policy; it is our duty and privilege to know that the army council of this country will take their instructions from Parliament and carry them out, and God forbid that a situation other than that should exist in this country.  It is poor service to this country for Parliament to shrug its shoulders and say: &ldquo;Leave that to the soldiers.&rdquo;  I think our soldiers are the right kind who do not want that left to them.  They want the will of Parliament to be made known that they may give the best possible and most efficient effect to it.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that individual Deputies in this House should not be so coy in speaking of defence matters, because they are the intimate interest of us all.  Whether what we say pleases or displeases individual soldiers, whatever their rank may be, unless I am greatly mistaken, they like to know that this House and this Oireachtas is concerned for the Army and about the Army; that if there are criticisms to be made of the Army they will be made here; if there is praise to be given it will be given; and if there are suggestions to be made they will be made here; that the Minister for Defence is here to speak for the Army and about the Army and to tell this Oireachtas what the Government's intentions are in respect of the Army.</P>
    <P>I press these points upon him and although I see now from the opening statement that he did give the relevant information about the £2,000,000 odd which is appropriated for defensive equipment if it would be convenient to him I would be grateful if he would elucidate them again in his concluding remarks.</P>

      <P>The debate has become rather wide in relation to the Supplementary Estimate and since we will have, on the main Estimate, an opportunity of going into these matters again, I do not think I should follow in detail the line of Deputy Cowan and to some extent of Deputy Dillon.  However, I suppose Deputy Cowan is right to this extent when he says that a general opinion seems to be abroad that the risk of war is less now than it was.  That may be the general opinion but I wonder whether the risk, such as has been there for the past two or three years, is in any way abated; that is not to say that war is a certainty or that it is a certainty that it will be avoided.  We all have our own personal opinions.  I have no hesitation in expressing my personal opinion, which is the same as it has been for a number of years, ever since 1948, in fact, when there was the reverse of engines as I have called it on previous occasions like this when talking about it in regard to defensive policy in the world. Personally I can find no cause for very great consolation.  I fear that at the present moment the fact that the threat has, so to speak, got into a more or less static phase leads people to believe that there is nothing very new to be reported from day to day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation as far as potential danger is concerned, or what I may call tension, remains to-day very much as it has been since 1948.  The very fact that it has remained more or less at the same <Col N="2086" /> level and that the type of news in relation to it tends to become repetition in newspapers, has led the public to regard it more or less as normality and they have been lulled into the feeling that just because it has not become very markedly worse, then it has become better.  That in itself is a rather dangerous thing and I, for one, do not agree&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the danger is any less to-day than it was.  I am afraid, if one looks at some other factors in the situation, whether from the point of view of development of equipment, expanding armaments, development of new weapons and of the political and military moves we see taking place, if one looks at the overall picture, one must regretfully come to the conclusion that things are not getting any better and, as the patient is sick, we have got to be prepared, or &mdash;I am very much afraid of the &ldquo;or&rdquo;. However, that is a matter of speculation to a certain extent.  The question is whether we should continue now with the policy of taking reasonable precautions. I have no hesitation in saying that we must continue taking these precautions and providing the insurance which is necessary and essential at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Dillon for that remark because it helps us a good deal and it enables us to consider the problems connected with this question.  Deputy Dillon will appreciate that I have adverted to this, not so much in regard to what Deputy Dillon has said as in regard to what Deputy Cowan has said.  I think there is still danger and that we should provide for it.  I join issue with Deputy Dillon in regard to the point of organisation, the main issue, though perhaps in our fundamental premises Deputy Dillon and I, for once, are not so far away as one might think at first sight. I see great danger in our making a catch-cry&mdash;I say this without offence to Deputy Dillon, but it has happened in other quarters in the past&mdash;of organising for guerilla tactics.  It has been used as a plea for saving money in very many ways.  The danger I see is that if <Col N="2087" /> you merely look at it from the point of view of organising a purely citizen guerilla force, without making any other provision to provide yourself at the outset with that holding power that Deputy Dillon wants to have and that I want to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of having initially that holding power with a transition to the commando and guerilla stage, if you want it later. That is a point of policy that I have tried to put over on previous occasions here.  However, we shall have an opportunity of discussing the matter further on the main Estimate when I think the Minister and others will welcome reasonable discussion on these matters.  It is a matter in which we should take an interest, and I am sorry that on past occasions so few have taken an interest in it.</P>
      <P>To get down to the question of equipment, Deputy Dillon asked about the nature of the equipment.  I, too, would like to ask some questions in that regard.  I am glad to know from the information made available to us that the equipment that is involved here is practically exclusively, with one exception which I think the Dáil would approve of, since it relates to the protection of populous areas, of the light mobile type.  It is a type of anti-tank weapon which can be used by the individual and which can be carried easily&mdash;weapons which are particularly adapted for the type of commando movement which has been mentioned.  I think it is right that the Minister should have taken that view. If one looks at the details there is not any great cause for difference of opinion between us here.  That being so, one infers that we all welcome the fact that the Minister has been able to get this equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to equipment generally, I should like to make the point that, apart from supplying the need which has been adverted to by Deputy Dillon, no matter how you look at the <Col N="2088" /> Army, the type of equipment which the Minister has provided for and which he has actually obtained, represents the closing of what has hitherto been a very serious gap in the defensive equipment of our forces such as they were.  Many Deputies will know already that when we mobilised in 1939, for instance, we were completely deficient in field artillery, combat vehicles and anything in the nature of an anti-tank weapon or an anti-armoured weapon.</P>
    <P>With regard to field artillery of the light type which we need here, you may talk about obsolescence, but the degree of improvement made in weapons of that type since the 1914-18 war is not of such a revolutionary nature as to render the previous type of equipment useless.  That equipment is still useful although it would not be represented as the very best. That gap was fairly well filled during the emergency period by the supplies we got in here.  It has been filled to an extent sufficient to enable us to face the future.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second item, combat vehicles, I purposefully use the words &ldquo;combat vehicles&rdquo; because we have not been, and we are not likely to be, able to equip ourselves with a sufficient amount of the modern defensive or heavy armoured vehicles. But the reconnaissance car, that is the car armoured against small arms, has a rôle to play here even on the basis Deputy Dillon mentioned.  We have been able to supply that want to some extent.  I think we should continue to supply that want as we get the opportunity.  Where we were not absolutely defenceless was in regard to anti-tank devices.  I have a little bit of experience or a little bit of special knowledge of that because I happened to be one of the people who were charged with looking into that problem at the time we were so completely devoid of them.  It is true that there is no possibility of our supplying that want from our resources.  We can go some distance with certain improvisations but the weapon you really need cannot be devised here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not understand what I am saying. What I am saying is that we could not improvise at the time the necessary type of weapon.  It was a type of weapon that was purchased here up to a short time ago.  One of the weapons which some of us have seen demonstrated was an anti-tank grenade of the type which could be launched from a rifle.  The source from which we got it does not very much matter.  It is essentially the same thing as the American weapon which Deputy Dillon talks about.  A great part of the expenditure concerned in this is related to that particular weapon.</P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, one of the most important purchases that we have made for the Defence Forces since the emergency.  The stores that have been purchased are of the type which would even meet some of the Deputies' postulated requirements.  They fill what has heretofore been a very serious gap in the equipment and armament of our Defence Forces such as they are.  After these stores are obtained our Defence Forces will be more effective.  I think that is the justification for these particular purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise.  I am afraid it is prudent to continue to look to these matters and provide for them.  That being so, the best way in which provision can be made on the equipment side is to get the type of equipment purchased.  We should, therefore, welcome this Supplementary Estimate in spite of our financial difficulties and the necessity of having to find the money.  I am not going to follow Deputy Dillon at the moment on the question as to why we cannot find other moneys if we can find moneys for these.  You cannot just take isolated incidents.  That is a type of <Col N="2090" /> argument which can be applied in a variety of ways.  One can run to the next when you have been cornered on one.</P>
    <P>I suppose that the Government&mdash;like all Governments&mdash;are faced with the desirability of providing for more than they can provide for and of having to make up their minds as to what our necessities are and provide for them. In this particular instance the Government have considered that in the long term and in the prudent view it is a virtual necessity to provide the sums in this Supplementary Estimate.  With their view on that matter I would agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one or two matters mentioned by Deputy Morrisey.  First of all, I do not understand Deputy Morrissey's assumed deference in approaching this. These problems are merely problems of common sense and we are just as competent to approach questions of defence on the basis of common sense as we are to approach any of the other complicated matters that arise in connection with State administration. I think Deputy Morrissey was unduly hesitant and modest in his approach. After all, this is a matter of common sense too.  It is good to raise the question of the Army barracks.  It does seem, looking at it from the point of view of the civilian and from the point of view of the ordinary man, to be unnecessary to maintain barracks that are not occupied.  What is the answer?  The answer is simply that these barracks are in the same category <Col N="2091" /> as equipment and the Defence Forces as a whole.  They will be, as far as the Exchequer is concerned, an expenditure in the nature of insurance for an event that may happen.  Most of us hope it will not happen.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion we had one experience to which there are two facets.  When it came to the limited mobilisation of 1939, which involved merely the mobilisation of 20,000 men, we were immediately in trouble for accommodation.  I remember a battalion moving into Mullingar barracks which was a wreck at the time.  The barracks had been lying there for years disused and grass was growing on the floors.  It represented considerable expenditure at a time when you wanted all the money you had, just as you want it now.  It represented a diversion of effort and a serious problem for the health and morale of people who were not used to living under those conditions being suddenly thrown into them. On top of all that, there was a scarcity of accommodation even at that time and some of us were, towards the end of that year, living in bivouac conditions out in the fields before we had been hardened to it.  You had problems for the medical officers, apart from protection problems and all the rest. When it came to the question of expansion afterwards, it was worse; but it would have been unmanageable only we had two bites of the cherry in having the first mobilisation in September and the second mobilisation in June.  We cannot hope to get that fortunate type of experience again.  We may hope for but we cannot bank on having the fortunate type of experience we had then when you got six to eight months' warning before you really got on to an emergency at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being the experience of the time, I remember at the end of the war, when reviewing the whole thing, that this question of accommodation loomed large in our calculations.  I suppose if we were to get by again as a neutral the only prudent thing would be to see that these Army barracks should be kept available for the forces.  That does not mean that if <Col N="2092" /> any temporary use could be found for them they should not be availed of.  I am glad to see that the F.C.A. can make use of them.  I would concede that if any temporary use were made of these barracks it would have to be subject to two conditions.  First, the barracks should be kept in a condition for immediate occupation by troops, and secondly, they should be made available immediately.</P>
    <P>Those requirements may militate against the barracks being made available for factories or as residential accommodation for families.  Once you allow a barracks to become a factory, on account of the internal alterations the barracks would not be available when you would want it.  The same thing would apply if you were to have them for residential purposes.  We could not clear the barracks quickly enough.  In theory you could.  In order to know what the practical problem is likely to be like you must see what you have.</P>
    <P>Regretfully, one has to regard this as another defence expenditure.  I think Deputy Morrissey was within his rights and acted reasonably in raising the question but I think what I have said must be the answer to it.  As to the remainder, any other points that arise can more appropriately be dealt with on the main Estimate.  I will conclude by simply saying that the Minister is to be congratulated on his success having regard to the circumstances under which he had to operate to get this essential equipment. I think it is still necessary to get it and I disagree with Deputy Cowan if he suggests otherwise.  That must of necessity be a personal expression of opinion.  We should pass the Estimate and leave policy over until the main Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister: &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; on the purchase of the most modern equipment possible, having regard to our purse. I was one of those present at a demonstration of weapons in Gormanston Camp last summer and I was agreeably surprised to see the firepower that has been placed in the hands of the infantry, firepower with a sub-machine <Col N="2093" /> gun and firepower in the form of an armour-piercing warhead which can be converted and used with the service rifle now in possession of our Army.  It entails no extra cost and on that account the Minister, the general staff and the personnel are to be congratulated on their foresight.</P>
      <P>In making provision for the comfort of troops, there should be better provision for married men in the provincial towns.  Housing accommodation is hard to come by in some of those towns and the married quarters available in the barracks are crowded out. I would suggest some arrangement between the Army and the local authorities to make better provision for married men.</P>
      <P>It is also a matter of gratification to see that the benefits of the Social Welfare Bill have been extended to the personnel of the Army.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the number of unemployed we may have in the country, it behoves us to make provision for the purchase of the most modern equipment possible, having regard to our purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the way in which this Estimate has been debated.  It is what I would naturally expect in view of the expressions which have come from all sides of the House in regard to the purchase of defence equipment whenever it would become available.  My predecessor put on record his views in that respect and made it very clear that he would not let money deter him from purchasing such equipment if it were available.  Perhaps I was more lucky than he, inasmuch as I was occupying this honourable position when the equipment became more easily obtainable.  Shortly after I assumed&mdash;or reassumed&mdash;office, I was in the happy position of being able to send away a delegation of experts to examine certain equipment that we were led to believe was available.  As a result of that examination, the experts recommended a particular type of equipment which could then be procured.  Being experts, they would not recommend anything which would <Col N="2094" /> not be of the greatest value to the Defence Forces of this State.  A contract was immediately entered into for the purchase of certain quantities of equipment and I am very glad to be able to say that most of it has now been delivered.  Further contracts were entered into with other countries and some of the material has been delivered, some is awaiting delivery and I hope that all of it will be in our custody in the course of another year or two.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the criticism in this debate was reasonable.  In one or two cases, Deputies were inclined to spread out a little and go off the rails or play a little with politics.  Deputy MacEoin gave me the impression that he disagreed with the Army strength we are aiming to secure but which, unfortunately, we have not secured, although we have recruited in the past year in the region of 5,000 men.  The fact that we are still only in the 10,000 mark, after recruiting 5,000 individuals only goes to show the absolute necessity to continue annually a recruiting campaign similar to that which we entered into at the beginning of last year.  Deputy MacEoin knows that, even if we had the 12,500 men which the peace establishment aims at, we would still be very much below that of the normal division as army strength goes. We aim at 12,500, as I explained on former occasions, in order to ensure that there will be an annual outflow from the Army into the Reserve and a principal reason why the Army experts, who made their recommendations in regard to the desirable strength, require 12,500 men is in order to secure that outflow into the Reserve, so that in the course of some years the Reserve will be there behind them, available at very short notice, highly trained, and ready to go into action if it should be necessary to do so.  From that point of view, every Deputy who will give that aspect of the matter a little examination will see how desirable it is to have the Army at full strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am just as anxious about the F.C.A. as Deputy MacEoin is and I should like to see the F.C.A. at the <Col N="2095" /> highest possible strength.  We have been endeavouring to build up that organisation and to make available to it various ways and means by which men would not only join the organisation but continue in membership of it.  It is rather regrettable to have to say that there is a continuous flow in and an equally continuous flow out, and the only thing I can say is that whatever limited amount of training these men get in the short period in which they are members of the organisation, should an emergency at some time or other arise, will be of some value, however small, in adding to the strength of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey played a little politics with the question of the 88,000 unemployed.  I do not know how he managed to bring it in, or how he managed to get away with it when he did bring it in, but he ought to know that, during the period of the last Government, there were 70,000 unemployed, with something like 34,000 people leaving the country annually.  I did not hear him making similar remarks on any Defence Estimate of that time about the unemployment situation.  He went on to elaborate on the question of providing for our own equipment&mdash;the manufacture of our own equipment.  I do not think there is a Deputy who would not be delighted to subscribe to that view, but we have no heavy industry here which would be capable of entering into the manufacture of, say, the anti-aircraft guns which we have to purchase from foreign countries.  If we had such industries, the full requirements of this State could, I believe, be met in the course of a month or two and the industry which would be established for the production of that type of equipment would find itself without contracts unless it was able to secure contracts for manufactures other than defensive equipment.</P>

      <P>It is true that we endeavoured for a considerable time to get established a munition factory for the purpose of producing .303 ammunition, but even there the difficulty was that we could supply our requirements of .303 ammunition in the course of a very short period&mdash;perhaps a month or so&mdash;so that, unless we could get outside contracts for the supply of that type of manufacture to some other people, the industry would either have to be abandoned at the end of a particular period or we would have to find other means of providing work for the factory staff.</P>
      <P>There were quite a number of references to Army personnel, their value to the nation and what the State should do to provide these boys with work when leaving the Army.  The State cannot undertake to produce a particular type of employment for these boys, but there is one thing we can all say: that is, that, as a result of their Army training and the sense of discipline inculcated into them, these boys are outstandingly better citizens than they were from the point of view of discipline, physique, health and so on, when they leave the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was inclined to advocate rather strongly that the type of equipment we should purchase now is the type of equipment that would be used by guerillas in any emergency situation.  That is what we have been aiming at.  We have been aiming at the type of equipment which is highly mobile, which can be carried about from place to place by individuals and perhaps on mobile carriers of one kind or another; but the Army is organised to defend this State as any army would defend it.  The Army has quite an amount of artillery equipment which Deputy Dillon seemed to think was obsolete and would be of little value.  Whether he is correct in that view or not remains to be seen, but the fact is that an army without that type of equipment could hardly be described as an army at all.  The men are being highly trained in the use of that equipment, <Col N="2097" /> and I should be inclined to say that they would give a very excellent account of themselves, if they should ever be called into action with that particular type of equipment.  Should the necessity arise for the Army to go guerilla, they are fully equipped to do that and I am sure it would be part of their plan to continue fighting as such, if they were in fact defeated in the field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey raised the question of barracks.  It is an important question.  I cannot say that we would be prepared to forgo the use of these barracks because they happen to be vacant at the particular moment.  The Army has had a rather bitter experience in respect of the giving away of barrack sites because they happen to be unoccupied at a particular period, and, as a result of that experience, I do not think they are prepared to forgo vacated barracks again.  They are, in the main, held by caretaker parties and they are being kept in reasonable condition.  In the course of his speech, Deputy Major de Valera referred to the circumstances under which he and his colleagues of the emergency period had to exist in Mullingar barracks.  He talked of occupying rooms in which the grass grew up through the floors and in which the rain came through the roof and through the ceilings from one storey to another.  That building was rebuilt and put into a habitable condition, and it has been kept in that condition.  I do not think that, in any circumstances, the Army would be prepared to forgo any of these vacated barracks at the present moment.  It is true that some of them are occupied. The barracks at Dundalk is occupied by an industrial firm, but it is occupied on the understanding that the firm undertake to vacate the premises if the Army require it urgently.  I believe, from experience, that when the time would come to reoccupy a barracks there would be considerable difficulty in getting a concern out, and it is from that point of view that I think the Army would not, in any circumstances, be prepared to forgo these barracks.  There would be the further question, in an emergency, of <Col N="2098" /> not having all the accommodation we might require and of again having to take over large mansions throughout the country which were the cause of considerable expense in the last emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the auction of surplus stores.  I cannot say a whole lot about that but I know that the Department take responsibility for the issue of these advertisements.  I think it is an ordinary statement in these types of advertisements that there will be a 5 per cent. auctioneer's fee.</P>

      <P>After that, there is the question of tender.  I do not know how the auctioneers tender.  Naturally, the auctioneers can tender for the particular sale only on equal terms. I assume that that is so and, from that point of view, they are all equal. There may be some arrangement between the auctioneers, of which I am not aware, in which some of them might be prepared to forgo a portion of the 5 per cent. or, in some circumstances, of all of that percentage.  I am not stating that as a fact: I am suggesting it after having heard the Deputy.  That may have been the ways and the means by which the contract was entered into.  I can see no other possible way by which the 5 per cent. auctioneer's fees should not go to the auctioneer.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Dillon expressed the desire to know something about the years which the payments of these sums of money would cover.  The payments will cover the years 1951-2, 1952-3, 1953-4, and 1954-5.  It will be seen that this large sum of money will be spread over a period of years.  It will not fall in one particular year and, from that point of view, it will not be a strain on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies that I do not get any pleasure in having to bring in a Supplementary Estimate: I am sure no Minister does.  In a case of this kind, where it is necessary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate because of a certain success achieved in the securing of this type of equipment, it takes away some of the feeling that one does not wish to have when bringing in this type of Estimate.</P>
      <P>The added expense in regard to petrol and other matters of that kind is due to a number of causes.  When Deputy Dillon was talking about provisions and allowances in lieu, he blamed the added expenditure entirely on the rise in the cost of living.  That is one of the reasons but it is not the main reason.  The main reason is the increased strength of the Army.  The expenses involved in regard to oils and petrols&mdash;which, also, were much criticised&mdash;apply to Army transport and to the air corps.  Again, the matter of added strength arises.  There have been 1,000 more hours of flying time in the Air Corps and, naturally, that uses up a considerably greater quantity of aviation spirit.</P>
      <P>As some Deputies mentioned, the debate on this Supplementary Estimate was somewhat on the lines of a debate on an annual Estimate.  I do not wish to go into a number of matters which would be more appropriate on an annual Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £580,000 be granted to defray the Charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1953, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, Miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The need for this supplementary sum arises mainly from the fact that expenditure of local authorities on health services proved greater than they had anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments of the Exchequer contribution are made on the basis of returns and estimates furnished to my Department by the health authorities. Ninety-five per cent. of the estimated amount of the grant is paid in the year to which the expenditure relates, in two instalments, one at the end of June and the other at the end of <Col N="2101" /> December.  In the next following year, by which time local authorities have actual, but unaudited, figures of their expenditure, a further 4.5 per cent. of the grant is paid over and the remaining half of 1 per cent. is held over until audited figures are available.</P>
    <P>The original Vote for the current year provided for grants amounting to £220,000 in respect of years prior to the current year and £4,960,000 in respect of the current year.</P>
    <P>The figure of £220,000 has proved to be entirely inadequate and the latest information I have of the amount payable in respect of balance of grants for previous years is £777,000, so that a further £557,000 is needed in respect of these previous years.  A large part of this sum (£200,000) is due to the fact that the cost of the turf cut by local authorities in 1951 under the Government sponsored turf scheme, which had been borne initially on a separate account in the books of each local authority, was transferred in full to the accounts of the services (including the health services) which will use the turf. The additional charges in respect of the health services appeared for the first time in financial statements furnished to my Department after the close of the financial year 1951-52.  The remaining increase is due to general increases in expenditure under a number of heads, partly due to increased costs and partly to improved services.</P>
    <P>The balance of the supplementary (£23,000) is in respect of expenditure of local authorities on health services in the current year in excess of the amount provided.  The excess here is largely due to the fact that after the original Estimate was prepared, it was necessary to increase the capitation grant payable by local authorities to voluntary hospitals in respect of patients sent by them to such hospitals by £1 1s. per week.  In addition, approximately half the cost of the temporary bonus of 9/- for men and 6/- for women authorised in December last has to be met from the Vote.</P>
    <P>A deficiency of £11,000 in the appropriations sub-head will be met from savings on other sub-heads&mdash;Salaries (£5,000) and Publicity (£6,000).</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I could gather from the Minister's statement, the greater portion of this money is needed to meet the increased cost of fuel, principally turf supplied to hospitals. He also stated that some part of it is due to the provision of improved services.  I should be glad if the Minister, when replying, would tell me what these improved services are.  I take it that what he has in mind is the scheme whereby he is to grant to local bodies a sum of £600 towards the cost of each new dispensary provided.  I do not know what the position is in other constituencies, but I certainly can say that in the constituency which I and the Minister represent&mdash;Wexford&mdash; improvement of the dispensaries is certainly not going ahead with the expedition that one would desire.  I think that on two occasions I, and other Deputies, had to ask questions about Foulksmills dispensary.  I am glad to say that the lease of it is out, and that we are going to have a new dispensary built there.  I think it ought to be stated that, for the best part of two years, there has been no roof whatsoever on that dispensary which was a small house.  The lighting was bad&mdash; at least before the roof fell off.  Now that the roof is not there, there is plenty of light.  It is no exaggeration to say that, on wet days, the doctor and the patients attending that dispensary were exposed to the elements.  They had the rain pouring down on them.  The drugs stored in it had long ceased to function due to the dampness of the place, and to the fact that they were covered with verdigris.</P>
      <P>There is another dispensary at Broadway.  I ask Deputies to picture it as a very old antiquated cottage with a thatched roof, and not a properly thatched roof at that.  The thatch is rotten.  The cottage is damp and old-fashioned, with small windows. Even on a bright sunny day, it would be dark inside.  In fact, its condition is so bad that on wet days the local people have facilitated patients attending there by admitting them to their homes or business premises. Actually, in some cases, the doctor has used these houses to see his patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In citing these cases, I do not mean <Col N="2103" /> to throw mud at the Minister, or to do anything like that.  I simply want to indicate the unhappy state of affairs that exists in the County Wexford so far as the dispensaries are concerned. I feel certain that conditions are much the same in other constituencies.  It is time that we took cognisance of these facts.  All of us desire an improvement in the health services.  You cannot have that without first having material improvements carried out.  The foundation of improved health services must be our dispensaries, and until they are of an up-to-date character there is no use in looking ahead for bigger things.</P>
    <P>We have got one or two new dispensaries in the County Wexford. There is a nice one at Bridgetown.  It was long overdue.  The building which had previously served as a dispensary was what one would describe as a condemned house.  It is essential that, in all our new dispensaries, we should have hot and cold water.  That is an essential part of the work which should be pushed ahead quickly.  Those who service our dispensaries&mdash;doctors and others&mdash;have had to endure too long the absence of hot and cold water in them.  They should also have electric light.  Its provision would not cost a lot.</P>
    <P>We know that it costs approximately about £1,000 to build a labourer's cottage I think the Minister said the other night that there were 621 dispensaries in Ireland.  I imagine it would cost something in the neighbourhood of £300,000 to replace those dispensaries which are in a bad condition. That, I suggest, would not be a large sum to spend in providing our people with dispensaries of an up-to-date character, and in good decent condition.  It is true to say that, ultimately, it would lead to a big saving of money.  If our dispensaries and our medical services are what they should be, then we are going to have a great improvement in the health of the people generally with, ultimately, a big reductions in expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the need there is for an ambulance service.  It is absolutely essential in country districts to have a <Col N="2104" /> good, efficient, up-to-date service of that kind.  Admittedly, there has been a good deal of improvement in that direction over the past few years.  At the same time, I would like to say that there are some ambulances on the road which should not be in service.  They are broken-down crocks.  So far as North Wexford is concerned, I am glad to say that during the last year or so we have had an ambulance functioning there.  But 12 months before that, we had no ambulance in the Gorey area, which has a population of from 15,000 to 16,000 people covering a very large rural area.  We had to depend entirely on an ordinary car for the removal to hospital of the necessitous poor and of those entitled to the service of an ambulance.  The only other ambulance at our disposal was a Red Cross ambulance which was not very satisfactory as it was not properly sprung and was most unsuitable for the purpose.  I would ask the Minister to give his attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done good work in initiating the scheme whereby £600 will be made available for the reconstruction of dispensaries.  I would ask him to make sure that local authorities go ahead with the scheme.  There has been evidence in Wexford of delay, and I am sure the same has existed everywhere else.  I would ask the Minister to see that the good scheme he has initiated is put into effect.</P>
    <P>There is a great shortage of nurses in this country.  It is not that we have not plenty of vocations for the nursing service.  We certainly have plenty of vocations and can produce very good nurses.  As proof of the success of Irish nurses when they go to England, they can always command employment, not only in the public services there but in the better-class districts, in the better hostels where nurses await cases.  They are extremely good at their job, considerate to the patients and well trained.</P>
    <P>We have not a great number of nurses in this country.  In rural Ireland we have no nurses at all.  I would ask the Minister to indicate whether it is the intention of his Department as a whole to service dispensaries with nurses.  That is a matter that seems <Col N="2105" /> to me to be a long time overdue. There are a few Jubilee nurses here and there, paid by voluntary contribution and there are some nurses in the West of Ireland but, generaly speaking, there are practically no nurses in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>That brings me to midwives.  I do not think we will ever have a decent service of midwives until they are paid a proper salary.  For the information of Deputies, midwives start at a salary of between £100 and £120 a year, and rise by increments to £160 a year. Does any Deputy consider that a living wage for a midwife?  A midwife has to have a certain standard of education. She has to go to Dublin, Cork or some other centre to train.  That involves her in considerable expense. She is then appointed to a district.  At one time there was a good deal of private practice in most districts, but private practice is gradually becoming a thing of the past.  The paternal State is stepping in and taking over and stifling private enterpise.  In some cases midwives have to live on this meagre salary.  Does the Minister or his departmental officials think that a sufficient number of midwives will be got to live in the country and to go to the expense of training in order to earn that disgraceful salary?  How can anybody live on £120 a year nowadays?  In a great many cases the midwife is a stranger in the district to which she is appointed and has to pay for lodgings.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question that I asked the Minister the other day, he told me that midwives had not very much to do, that in fact some of them never get a case at all.  That may be true, but the fact remains that their job is in a certain area; they have to live in that area; they have to live in that area and have to pay for their keep in that area.  My point is that they cannot do it on the present salary.  It is a matter that should be investigated by the Minister.  The Minister should give midwives fair play.  They should get a definite increase in salary.  The only increase they have had was some sort of allowance for uniform in the last year or so.</P>
    <P>Ante-natal clinics seem to me to be one of the most essential things in the matter of health.  Ante-natal work as <Col N="2106" /> far as the country districts go, outside the big centres, is non-existent.  It should be the aim of the Minister and his Department to set up ante-natal clinics.  They should be set up in all the provincial towns.  There would be a great saving in health by that means. There would be less trouble at the time of parturition if the women were properly looked after and examined beforehand.  The building of these clinics will certainly entail a certain amount of money but it will be money better spent than in building Store Street bus station or something to that effect.  I would prefer to see it spent on clinics.  The Minister can rest assured that he will not get any opposition from this side of the House if he proposes to build them.</P>
    <P>When I was talking on a Health Estimate shortly after coming to this House I advised the Minister that there was a very fine clinic set up and built by voluntary contribution, through the generosity of a local lady, in the town of Arklow which seems to me to be ideal.  There is a nurse in residence who examines cases there and ante-natal conditions in that are have improved considerably.  The establishment of an ante-natal clinic in practically every town should be the earliest concern of the Minister and he should go straight away with it.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that relations in the health world, dealing with health matters in general over the past four or five years, have not been happy.  Matters appertaining to health have been discussed a great deal in the public Press.  There has been a good deal of exchange of letters and opinions, which is highly undesirable.  A better atmosphere in health is most desirable.  The purpose of the Department of Health is to give to the people a decent health service.  It is not to spend their time scrapping with everybody else.  This business has been going on for several years.  There is one way of ending it and it is a simple way.  The best way to give the people not only a Health Act but the best health conditions is for the Minister to appoint an advisory council.  The Minister will say that he has an advisory council already.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should appoint an advisory council that is not <Col N="2107" /> controlled or run by the Custom House. In the legal profession we are quite prepared, and I am sure the public are also prepared, to accept the advice of the Custom House on matters appertaining to health but the Custom House should not have the last word in everything.  My feeling is that all important matters appertaining to health over the past years have emanted from the Custom House and from the officials in the Custom House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with what Deputy Esmonde has said in regard to the condition of many of our dispensaries but the remarks in connection with dispensaries would be directed to better purpose to the responsible local authorities in view of the fact that money is now available to the various local authorities for the improvement of existing dispensaries and the erection of new ones.  In my constituency at one period there was grave need for the improvement of dispensaries.  I am glad to say that that work is going ahead at a reasonably rapid rate all over the county at the moment.  Responsibility for dispensaries lies to a great extent with the local authorities and I think many of these bodies are not living up to their responsibility in that regard.  I suggest that Deputy Esmonde make his views on this matter known forcibly and emphatically to the local authority of the county that he represents.</P>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy Esmonde as regards the nursing profession.  Nurses are anything but well paid apart from the increase in the cost of living at the present time. Their salaries are miserly.  It is a miracle that we get any nurses at all to remain at home when one considers the better conditions and the more attractive terms on which they can secure work elsewhere.  The Minister should take the advice of the House on the question of salaries in connection with the nursing profession.  I am sure I am not the only Deputy who will speak on this matter or plead for improved conditions for our nurses. Even the Minister must admit that this is a matter needing attention.  I merely want to remind him of the necessity for such improvement.  As far as I am concerned he will have my assistance by way of vote here at any time that he comes in here with proposals for the improvement of conditions in that particular profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very interested in the fuel supplies of State institutions.  I would like the Minister to let us know, in reply, whether local authority institutions <Col N="2109" /> and hospitals utilise turf.  I would like him to tell us whether there are local authority hospitals using coal or oil.  If they are using such fuel I think it is a disgrace and I think they are setting a very bad example in giving preference to foreign fuel as against home-produced fuel.</P>
    <P>Recently in Galway I discovered that in the new health institution there heating and cooking will be done by means of oil-burners.  I have been told that oil-burners have been installed for that purpose.  If that is true, I think there is something radically wrong in a system that allows such a thing to occur.  I need not point out that the greater proportion of our fuel resources lies in the West of Ireland. Apart from the excellent quality of the turf available there the employment content is an important matter.  The production of turf is of benefit to many homes in the West of Ireland.  Surely we should be patriotic enough now to use native fuel in preference to imported fuel.  I do not think there should be any necessity for me to impress on the Minister the importance of utilising our own fuel in our health institutions.</P>
    <P>Apart from native fuel being a more economic proposition we have spent enormous sums in recent years in dollar currency on the importation of American coal.  Last October we spent £590,000 on American coal.  We should only import our minimum fuel requirements.  I know that there are certain people who dislike turf.  Many engineers in public institutions turn up their noses at the suggestion that turf should be used instead of coal or oil.  They make all sorts of excuses for their attitude.  They say turf is an inferior product and that it does not give the same economic return as coal or oil.  That argument is altogether without foundation, because I have seen for myself that in certain industrial institutions turf has proved to be more economic than and infinitely superior to coal.  If it is successful in one industrial concern, I see no reason why that success could not be extended to every institution in the country.  It is the duty of the Government and the Minister to ensure <Col N="2110" /> that native fuel is utilised in our institutions. That can be done by requesting these establishments to change their system of heating and cooking. I do not think it is too late yet with regard to the particular institution I have in mind, and I would like if the Minister, when he is concluding, would let us know the position if he has any information.</P>
    <P>One of the things we would like to see in this country is a first-class health service.  I think all Deputies in this House will agree that the main object of the Minister at the present time it to give improved health services generally, and his anxiety is to ensure that the services that will be given will be the best possible.  I have no doubt that they will be planned, not to meet the wishes solely of the Irish Medical Association but with the main purpose in mind of meeting the needs of the people of Ireland, and the wishes and demands of the Medical Association will come only second to the needs of the people.  I am sure the Minister is bearing that in mind in connection with this Supplementary Estimate and also in connection with other Estimates and so forth, that he has in view at the present time.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the nursing profession, a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists among those in the probationer class.  On various occasions Deputies in this House have raised grievances on behalf of the probationer groups in the various hospitals and, to my mind, it is time that a little bit of reorganisation took place in this particular matter.  Those girls have reached the use of reason and they are out of the kindergarten class but the mentality still exists in many of our hospitals that those girls must, even in the few hours off duty, be in at 10.30 at night and the door is locked on them then.  One would imagine these girls had entered a religious order or that they were novices rather than probationers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde, when he was speaking, gave me an unpleaasnt jolt when he mentioned the Health Council.

I must convey my apologies to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not there to add to the anti-Custom House atmosphere that apparently was there from what the Minister says.  What I want to say will be more strictly relevant to the Estimate.  This Estimate arises because of the provisions of the Health (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, and I want to put it to the Minister very strongly that it is time that the figures for the standard year, which I think was 1947/48, were fixed. County councils do not know where they are in regard to health.  They do not know what health grants they will receive until the standard year is fixed. It is certainly our experience in Kildare that the figures for the standard year 1947/48 have not yet been agreed and finally audited.  I can speak with positive assertion in respect of Kildare but I am also told that a similar position arises in respect of other councils with the result that it is still a matter very largely of guesswork in any council and local health authority in regard to framing their Estimate as to what will be the grant they will obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was answering questions to-day, in respect of one question, as far as I could hear him, <Col N="2112" /> he told us that the average rate raised for health services throughout the country was 1/2½.  All I can tell the Minister is the demand which the county manager has given us for next year and which the Kildare County Council will be considering next Tuesday, shows the manager's demand for health services at 53.36d. which is 4/5.  I would be very interested to know whether the very low figures in the estimates all over the country come to bring down our figure of that amount to the average which apparently prevails throughout the country, if I heard the Minister correctly at Question Time to-day.  I do not want to be too dogmatic on that because I found it difficult to follow exactly the reply to the question.  Therefore, if that was not what the Minister said at Question Time I hope he will correct it.</P>
    <P>The position so far as I can see is that the expenditure by health authorities on health services is now getting to a pitch at which it is fast going to be beyond the realms of the ratepayers to bear, beyond their capacity for existing services without taking into account anything at all in respect of new services that may be introduced under the Health Bill or otherwise and in respect of which I do not think I would be in order in speaking on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this Estimate which is brought in under the 1947 Health (Financial Provisions) Act the position is that we in Kildare are reaching 4/5 this coming year for health services alone and so far as we can estimate we are now double the standard year. We are in the position in Kildare that no matter what the members of the county council may wish the rates for health services will jump by leaps and bounds.  That is the situation which I am quite sure is reflected equally in other counties and it is a situation that will create a very serious problem indeed for local authorities.  Unless the Minister makes up his mind to soften the heart of the Minister for Finance&mdash;if indeed Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, has any heart &mdash;and comes to the assistance of health authorities, then the problem will be one that will be far beyond the <Col N="2113" /> capacity of the local health authorities to bear.</P>
    <P>I might add that I am also told that part of our problem in Kildare is in respect to delay in the payment of the health grant.  I want to be quite fair when I say that I am not quite clear whether this delay is in the payment of ascertained grants or whether it is delay in the payment of the full grant because it has not been fully ascertained, due to the delay in auditing the standard year's accounts.  I should like the Minister, if possible when he is replying, to tell the House how many health authorities are in the same position as Kildare in not having their full grants paid and what is the reason. Is it because they too have not got the standard year's accounts audited or has there been a retention of health grants normally payable to local authorities for some other reason?  One of the problems that arises in Kildare is that we are estimating that in the coming year we shall receive substantially less by way of health grants than we thought we would receive, and that we are going to receive this year substantially less than our estimated figure.</P>
    <P>When we were striking the rate this time last year, we made the best shot we could at the standard year to arrive at the 1952-53 grant, and it was solely as a result of the erroneous figures we had before us, whether due to juggling at the departmental end or at the county council end I do not know, that there is a fall shown in the receipts for that year.  All that goes to show that health authorities will not see where they are until this time lag is made up, until more rigid rules are observed in regard to existing payments and unless, in regard to future legislation and future services, an effort is made to put the cost of additional services on the Exchequer rather than on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how we can possibly expect that the new services that are visualised will not mean an increase in cost of between 2/- and 3/- in the £ in the rates in our county.  When you add that to the county manager's demand of 4/5 for health services for <Col N="2114" /> this year, it is easy to visualise what the total rate demanded from the ratepayers will be.  The situation is one that is causing the ratepayers considerable anxiety.  It is a situation which it is in the power of the Minister to remedy.  I hope that when he is replying to the debate on this Estimate or when he is introducing his main Estimate he will indicate that he intends to take steps to remedy that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy McQuillan in appealing to the Minister to see that local authorities use turf in their institutions where it is possible to procure turf, particularly in the north-western, western and southern counties.  The Minister in this Vote is seeking certain funds to recoup local authorities for money expended on turf in the year 1951.  I am very anxious to know whether this expense was incurred by local authorities in procuring and burning turf in their institutions or whether the amount involved represents outlay incurred by them in cutting turf by direct labour. We, people who live in turf areas, are aware of the mess made by local authorities in the cutting of turf by direct labour.  The cutting and winning of turf, particularly hand-won turf, is a specialised job, and I think that local contractors should be invited to tender for the supply of turf for these institutions.  Local authorities would thereby save a considerable amount of money.  I am also aware that during the emergency turf was cut in the County of Donegal by local authorities at the expense of the local ratepayer and the taxpayer which has never since been taken out of the bog. I would appeal to the Minister to insist on local authorities procuring hand-won turf from local contractors and not to allow them to become themselves producers and competitors with these local contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Dr. Esmonde in asking the Minister to do something for rural dispensaries.  I was amazed to hear that in the Minister's own constituency dispensaries are in the condition described by Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  That description sounded bad, but I wish the Minister could <Col N="2115" /> visit some of the dispensaries in West Donegal and see what they are like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And elsewhere.  The Minister may be surprised to learn that in certain dispensaries in County Donegal it has been found necessary to throw out milk powders as a result of dampness in the building in which they were stored.  Actually more has been lost by the State and the ratepayers because of the destruction of medicine and milk powders than would defray necessary repairs to the buildings in which these commodities were stored. I would appeal to the Minister to see that local authorities do their duty in regard to dispensaries, that they should rebuild those which are beyond repair and carry out repairs where necessary to existing dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the matter of recoupment to local authorities for outlay incurred in the upkeep of patients in extern hospitals, hospitals not under the control of the local authority.  If a local dispensary doctor wishes to have a patient transferred from County Donegal to one of the Dublin hospitals, by the time the means of the applicant are first of all investigated, the ambulance procured to provide transport and some wirepulling done to get a bed in some Dublin hospital, the patient is generally on the way to the graveyard.  This is a matter in which, in my opinion, expense could be reduced considerably. In these days, when we are falling over the necks of Ministers in the Six Counties, I think some reciprocal arrangement could be made between our Minister and the Minister for Health in the Six Counties whereby patients from Donegal would receive an allocation of beds in hospitals in Londonderry &mdash;that is the official name for it in the Six County Government area, but I think Doire Cholm Cille will remain the name by which it will be known to us&mdash;or Belfast.  A considerable amount would be saved in transport to Derry or Belfast and we, in turn, possibly could facilitate our opposite number in the Six Counties <Col N="2116" /> by the provision of beds, say, in Monaghan, Dundalk or Dublin for some of the areas along that particular part of the Border.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to give earnest consideration to that. Remember that in some parts of Donegal we are actually 250 miles from Dublin.  If the patient has to travel by ambulance after 9 o'clock at night it means an ambulance travelling a distance of 500 miles to bring a patient to Dublin and go back.  This is some of the money which is being expended by the local authorities and which the Minister tried to recoup the local authority for under this vote.  I am suggesting that he should ask the local authorities and his counterpart in the North to give serious consideration to this reciprocal arrangement and thereby cut down some of the expense incurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Estimate and I rise principally to add my voice to what has already been said in regard to the condition of the dispensaries throughout the country.  Not only in the country places are the dispensaries in such a shocking bad state of disrepair but also in the City of Dublin.  They are unsuitable for the work they have to do.  The Minister himself has given figures which can only be described as appalling in view of the development that has been going on in this country in the health services for the last few years.  He has now informed us that in a recent review of the dispensaries it was shown that out of 621 dispensaries 330 were unsuitable.  It seems to me that the major part of the effort of the Department in future in regard to hospital reconstruction should be directed towards improving existing dispensaries and building new ones in order to have proper facilities for the people in need of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the improvement of hospital expenditure I should like to point out to the Ministers and the House that the recent most up-to-date figures which cannot, indeed, be very up-to-date, for hospital expenditure show that in the year ending 31st March, 1951, out of a sum of approximately £2,000,000 spent on hospital <Col N="2117" /> reconstruction only £19,125 was spent on dispensary reconstruction.  It seems to me that in the overall planning of the Minister's Department he should pay much more attention to the need for improving the dispensaries throughout the country and if necessary put lower down in his priority list the building of other types of hospitals or clinics.</P>
    <P>In reference to the expenditure of this sum out of the Hospitals' Trust Funds, I would like to point out to the Minister and the House the dangerous state into which the finances of the Hospitals' Trust Fund have now got themselves.  It seems to me that the Minister should endeavour to take an opportunity if not on this Estimate at any rate at a later stage to make some statement to the House as to what is the position in regard to future plans of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  I appreciate that this is not a matter which arises directly on this Supplementary Estimate but I do feel, however, that the expenditure of State funds on dispensaries does arise.  Some of the figures are, indeed, very difficult to ascertain.  It would appear that on the 31st December, 1947 there were £9.7 millions in the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  On the 31st March, 1951, there would have been approximately £5.3 millions spent out of that fund on capital reconstruction.  That has been going on at the rate of £2,000,000 a year and it would appear that the capital fund from which money can be spent on dispensaries reconstruction and hospital building out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund is very nearly exhausted.  The current income may be sufficient to pay the deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  It will not be sufficient in the future, probably at the end of this year, to pay for future reconstruction of a capital nature on dispensaries and hospitals.</P>
    <P>That is a matter in respect of which the Ceann Comhairle has been lenient in allowing me to bring it up on this Estimate but I would say that the provision of adequate dispensaries, the provision of proper places for persons to wait and the provision of proper facilities such as running water which <Col N="2118" /> are lacking in some dispensaries are matters which come up on this Estimate. They should be looked after by the Minister in the administration of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the money is to be expended because of the financial provisions of the 1947 Act.  There are some general considerations which, I think, will probably soon arise out of this expenditure.  It has a certain amount of relevance to the point made by Deputy Declan Costello.  The payments to be made under the financial provisions of the 1947 Act will tend to increase because of the fact that the Hospitals' Sweep Funds are almost completely expended or will be completely expended in a very short time. Therefore, the funds to maintain these hospitals in the future will have to come either from the Exchequer or from the rates.</P>
      <P>I think now is the time when the Minister will have to give very careful consideration to the degree of autonomy which he is going to permit to these voluntary hospitals in the future if their demands on the Central Exchequer continue to grow as they must necessarily grow in the years to come.</P>
      <P>The point in which I am particularly interested is one which I raised some years ago in relation to the Meath Hospital Bill.  If we believe in the democratic control of institutions generally, we must insist on a certain amount of representation by local authorities or nominees of the Minister in the control of finances allocated to the voluntary hospitals by this House. An important principle is involved, in that moneys voted by the Houses should be expended only under the supervision of nominees of the House or of the Minister or local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals are facing a crisis in their affairs and we are facing this very important change in the relationship of these hospitals to the community.  I do not know if there would be much enthusiasm in the House&mdash;and there will be very little enthusiasm in the voluntary hospitals&mdash; for this evolution towards a more democratic control of these institutions, <Col N="2119" /> but if we are to be certain that money raised by the House is properly expended we must insist on its being expended under the control of the nominees I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The nominees of county councils, of the city corporations and of the Minister have shown themselves generally, in relation to public institutions, to be quite competent to handle their affairs, as in the case of sanatoria, mental hospitals, fever hospitals and so on.  Consequently, it cannot be argued that they would not be able to provide at least as good a service as is at present provided.  I intend to deal with this matter more fully on a Bill which I understand is coming before the House in relation to one of the voluntary hospitals.  I hope that by then the Minister will have his views quite clear on this very important point.</P>
    <P>A lot of the money in this Estimate will be spent on the so-called free services to be made available under the tuberculosis and other regulations. There is a general point there which I would like to deal with very briefly, namely, the attitude of public officials in the payment of these moneys to those suffering from infectious diseases or their dependents.  We are now moving into a phase in Ireland in which the community is taking over greater responsibilities in providing these social services and health services. It is important that the officials administering these services throughout the country should be clearly conscious of the fact that that money they are handing out, whether in payment for hospital services or as allowances for dependents, is the people's money, that it is from the communal purse and is not handed out because of any particular act of self-denial on the part of such officials.  I would like the Minister to emphasise the importance of developing this understanding amongst local authorities.  For years in the case of many services&mdash;particularly social services at labour exchanges, old age pensions and health services&mdash;the officials have been dominated by the older poor law atmosphere of condescending charity, giving something <Col N="2120" /> which a person hardly deserved and giving it merely to keep him alive.  I would like the Minister to impress on all public officials the important fact that they are administering services paid for out of the community purse and that any man, woman or child availing of them does so as of right, is beholden to nobody and is taking charity from nobody, as these services are there to be claimed whenever they are needed.</P>
    <P>Let me quote an example I had recently of a patient in a hospital who was recalcitrant and, because of that, was removed from the hospital.  The medical officer acted quite within his rights in removing him.  At the same time, he decided to deprive the man of the allowances which he should receive under the infectious diseases regulations.  Again he was within his rights, as the man was not receiving treatment according to his instructions. After a short time the man decided to return to the hospital and take treatment.  The medical officer continued to withhold the allowance, as far as I can see as a form of reprisal for the man's recalcitrance.  The trouble about that was that the man suffered, his three children suffered and his wife suffered, until the whole question was put straight.  I know well, and no one knows better, how much good work public officials do, and nobody hopes more than I do that they may be able to do a lot more of such good work.  No one knows more than I do how much they will be criticised for it.  At the same time, I would be the last to say they are faultless in their behaviour to the public. I have made objections wherever they have been in any way objectionable to people who have a perfect right to good manners.  Secondly, by cases such as these, they give opportunities to the opponents of the extension of State service of this kind to criticise these extensions.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous amount of criticism of dispensaries and all of it perfectly well deserved.  I do not know what the Minister's views are on the question of the extension or improvement of dispensary services, but I believe there is no hope at all for the dispensary services.  My hope always <Col N="2121" /> has been that they would disappear from the public health services altogether and I believe that that, in fact, is what will happen when the extended health services provide opportunities for people to visit the doctor in his private house, because he is getting paid for them as separate cases.  I think people will go less and less to the dispensaries and more to the doctor's private house.</P>
    <P>I had no real hope that the dispensary services could be improved to any great extent.  It is a hopeless service and fundamentally it was unsound.  It is because of that that it has fallen into the state of desuetude in which it is at present.  It would be very unwise to spend a lot of money on dispensaries if the other ideal, of all patients going to the doctor's private house, could be achieved and I think that can best be achieved by the provision of practical health services without any difference between the paying and non-paying type of patient.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask if any further steps have been taken towards the setting up of a post-graduate school in St. Kevin's Hospital.  The constructional changes there have reached a very advanced stage and the idea was &mdash;it was recommended by the consultative council set up by the Minister some years ago&mdash;that a post-graduate educational institution should be established in St. Kevin's.  This is an excellent idea for the improvement of the standard of the public health services and the public health service offices, and the Minister might let us know whether the proposal recommended by the consultative council is likely to be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also if any steps have been taken by the Dublin Corporation to implement the proposals of the Danish expert on tuberculosis dispensary services which were put forward by him during his visit some years ago.  I recall that he was very critical of the dispensary services at the time and made a number of fairly sweeping suggestions, all of which seemed to me, while not knowing very much about that side of the business, to be reasonably sound and very necessary&mdash;at least he made a <Col N="2122" /> very good case for them.  I wonder whether that report has been implemented to any extent at all by the corporation.  The reason for bringing the man over at all was that he ran an excellent service in, I think, Copenhagen, one of the best in the world, and the idea was that we should establish in Dublin a pilot dispensary service which would gradually extend to the different cities and larger population areas in Ireland, because it was always felt that one of the weakest parts of our otherwise excellent health services in relation to infectious diseases is the dispensary or diagnostic side.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to know what progress has been made with regard to the extension of the B.C.G. campaign and what success the Minister is having with regard to this service, which could do so much good and which has done a fair amount of good up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not customary on a Supplementary Estimate for matters of principle to arise, but I think the query raised by Deputy Browne with regard to voluntary hospitals is one on which most Deputies will wish to hear from the Minister a clear decision in principle.  If I correctly interpret Deputy Browne, his view is that the voluntary hospitals should cease to be voluntary hospitals and should come, at least in some measure, under public supervision.  I think that probably most Deputies will agree that, if that suggestion is acted upon, we are putting our foot on the road which leads directly to the British system of the conversion of all voluntary hospitals into public health institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a matter on which we have to make our choice here and now&mdash;let those who believe in the voluntary hospitals and their continued service to the community say so and let those in favour of the abolition of the entire system of voluntary hospitals in this country elect for that, in the full knowledge of what they are doing.  There is no half-way house and there is no use in pretending that a voluntary hospital continues to be a voluntary hospital, once the State claims the right to put on its board a certain <Col N="2123" /> number of nominess who shall have, in the last analysis, a veto over the administration of the hospital by their power to threaten the withdrawal of whatever State grants the hospital has been brought to depend upon for its continued existence.</P>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of the fact that the voluntary hospitals in this country carried on for a century without receiving one penny piece from the State.  They carried on on the charitable contributions of those who so highly valued their services to the community that they put their hands into their own pockets and annually gave to these hospitals the funds wherewith to carry them on.  I believe that the first breach of that system was the contributions under the Hospitals' Sweeps.  That was followed by a general practice which has grown up of the local authorities, when referring a patient from their own municipal hospital to a voluntary hospital, undertaking to pay a weekly sum out of the rates for the maintenance of the patient referred to the voluntary hospital.  But the voluntary hospitals, particularly in the City of Dublin, which have catered for the poor of this city on a voluntary basis, providing them with an infinitely better dispensary service than the State has ever succeeded in providing in their own out-patients department and providing for the acutely sick free of charge are, in my judgment, a very precious asset to our society.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, the Government have turned their back on the voluntary principle, have wiped these hospitals out and have insisted on their becoming State institutions.  Does this Oireachtas intend or desire to do that here?  If we do, we ought to do it with our eyes open, and we ought to do it honestly and above board, and not by moving in under cover of claiming that we are doing no more than our minimum duty in supervising the expenditure of public funds.  Far from agreeing with Deputy Browne that it is an essential consequence of making available public funds to a voluntary body that you should put in Government <Col N="2124" /> nominees to interfere in its internal management, I strongly urge on the Minister that one of the prime aims of any Government should be to identify in the State the voluntary bodies doing good work to whom Grants-in-Aid may safely be made, without any claim on the part of the State to supervise their outlay.</P>
    <P>It is quite illusory to imagine that there is anything foreign in this or that it is a new departure.  We give Grants-in-Aid to an authority.  When I was a Minister of State in this country my advice to the Government and my injunction to the Department over which I was in charge was that we should seek out voluntary bodies doing useful work and seek an opportunity to come to their aid, on the clear understanding that the aid we gave them carried with it no implication whatever that we claimed to interfere with the administration of the work to which they put their hands.  I remember sending for the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and saying to them that I had got approval from the Government to tell them that hereafter their annual Grant-in-Aid was made to them on the clear understanding that they had no duty to the Government in respect of it except that, at the end of the 12 months, they must certify that it had been spent for the purpose of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  I remember, without naming a variety of other bodies, both the then Minister for Education and myself determining certain voluntary associations throughout the country with whom a similar course of action might with propriety be pursued because we valued the fact that they were prepared to do a useful public service on a voluntary basis, and that on that basis, they could perform that public service infinitely better than any bureaucratic machine, however good, could do it.</P>
    <P>I think that a defect that tends to make the desire to serve of many well-intentioned persons fated to futility in this country is the obsession that the eminently desirable thing to do is to put every activity in this community under the supervision and in charge of the State.  I think a great many people <Col N="2125" /> are orientated in that connection by the fact that their heads are as soft as their hearts and that, moved by human suffering, they cannot hold back from the desire to rush in and seek to right what is wrong, regardless of the fact that they are quite liable to leave a trail of disaster behind them infinitely worse than the evil that moved them to move precipitately.</P>
    <P>So far as the public health services in this country are concerned, it would be infinitely better if they could all be administered on a voluntary basis.  In so far as we have to depart from that &mdash;and I admit that in certain connections it is necessary to depart from the purely voluntary basis&mdash;I would do so with reluctance.  I urge on the Minister for Health here and now to recognise the profound significance of the issues raised by Deputy Dr. Browne and to tell us here and now the policy of the Government.  Do the Government accept the view of Deputy Dr. Browne that the time has come to move in on the voluntary hospitals then do they reject it?  If they intend to move in on the voluntary hospitals then I want them to give this House a chance of expressing an opinion on that net question.  I want to say quite clearly, definitely and explicitly that every resource I could deploy to prevent such a development would be deployed by me.  I would regard it as a catastrophe for the country if the great voluntary hospitals&mdash;which, in many cases, have led the world in the provision of services for the sick poor &mdash;were set aside and their place taken by public institutions.  The municipal hospitals do the best job they can. Local authority hospitals do the best job they can.  In comparison with the services provided by good voluntary hospitals, the State institution can make only a very second-rate contribution. There is no use in advancing the view that we can find certain voluntary institutions in this country or in other countries which are capable of improvement.  If that test were applied to municipal institutions, the results might be fairly startling because, no matter how carefully they may be supervised, the experience of us all is that the municipally-run <Col N="2126" /> institution is liable to fail from time to time and require reorganisation and even rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The great assurance and advantage that we in this country enjoy in the voluntary hospitals is that, in many cases, they are run by religious Orders whose contribution to their sound operation and proper surveillance can never adequately be estimated or valued.  Other voluntary hospitals are run by a body of public-spirited citizens who give their time for no purpose other than that of seeing, on a voluntary basis, the sound operation of the institution, the primary purpose of which is to look after the sick poor. God forbid the day should ever dawn in this country that we should think it something disreputable and contemptible for people, actuated by charity, to give of their time and attention to cater for the sick poor.</P>
    <P>I want to make an inquiry in regard to dispensaries.  There is one great danger if one gets in contact with physicians in public life, and that is the irresistible urge which seems to impel them to remove all the laity into glass-cases, to screen them, to cover them with cotton wool, to keep them in aseptic atmospheres, to rub their hands while they watch us grow old in strictly aseptic conditions under aseptic restrictions and, if we do not like it, to be told authoritatively that we do not know what is good for us, that this is good for us and that we had better like it or lump it.  I think the average rational citizen of this country does not want to be rubbed by doctors and nurses in clinics and dispensaries. They do not want to be met by people at street corners and given an injection, or have their teeth extracted or their eyes examined or queried as to the regularity of their bowels.  Life ceases to be worth living if, at every street corner, you are examined to see if you have the mumps or the measles or the whooping-cough or some other particular complaint&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey puts it in a nutshell.  I do not want to be <Col N="2127" /> shoved into a hospital or a dispensary or anywhere else: if I want to go there I know my way.  A lot of people in this country know very clearly that nobody has the power to shanghai them, if they are susceptible to a disease, into a hospital or a dispensary or a clinic&mdash;even though it might be a very good thing if some of them were shanghaied into a hospital, a dispensary or a clinic and nursed back to health.  I think it is very important to pause here.  Everybody in this country, whether he be rich or poor, should have available to him a satisfactory service to which he can have recourse if he requires it.  One of the first essentials to that end is to provide dispensaries where there will be accommodation for people who want to go into them and where there will be doctors competent to attend them.</P>

      <P>If I want to go to a doctor I have to go wherever he is. I go to the dispensary, and if he is not there I go to his residence.  I do not see any humiliation in going and sitting beside my neighbour while I wait to see the doctor.  We are all getting very proud and dignified in this country.  It had never dawned on me that I was suffering any humiliation when I went to a doctor's house and sat in the waiting-room beside a country woman who was there ten minutes before me and was called into the doctor's surgery before me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I am making: why can we not provide decent dispensaries where rich and poor and everybody else who wants to see the doctor can go?  Deputy Dr. Browne's delicacy about doing away with the dispensaries, and asking why should not the people go to the doctor's parlour, is all very fine.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a lot of highfalutin <Col N="2128" /> talk here about the need for reform.  I suggest that what we ought to do is not to change the system but to provide decent dispensaries to which the people can go.  That is what you need before you carry out any other reforms.  The Minister has told us that he has made an offer to the local authorities to give a contribution towards the cost of erecting new dispensaries.</P>
      <P>I claim to be familiar with conditions in rural Ireland.  In Ballaghaderreen, where I happen to live, there is a reasonably good dispensary which was built by the Roscommon County Council. They have dispensaries in Strokestown and Elphin which one would be afraid to enter.  I also know something about the dispensary system in this city where I was born, especially the Gardiner Street part of the city.  I do not believe that there is nearly enough accommodation for a tithe of the people who attend the dispensaries in those areas.</P>
      <P>Why talk about a lot of other things when, manifestly, we have not done the things which are essential?  I believe that most dispensary doctors in Dublin are simply overwhelmed by the number of patients they are expected to wait on, and that the staffing in the dispensaries is grossly inadequate. Why do we not put these things right? For the last 30 years we have been an independent nation.</P>

      <P>I never heard anybody say, until 1952, that there was not money available to provide decent dispensaries for the people.  I suggest to the House that we ought to do first things first.  Can we, first of all, make up our minds as to whether we want dispensaries or not?  Let us make up our minds on that fundamental question.  I am prepared to say that, in my opinion, the first step to take is to provide a decent dispensary building with adequate staffing, and if that requires more than one doctor, then get more than one to attend the patients we want to go there and have their sickness investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne wants everyone <Col N="2129" /> to go to the doctor's residence and to do away with the dispensaries.  Are we to spend £2,000,000 on building dispensaries and then discover that we do not want them?  I think that the Minister for Health ought to tell us what are the intentions of the Government in that regard.  Does the Minister share the view of Deputy Dr. Browne that all dispensaries are to be abolished, or does he share my view that far from abolishing them we ought to improve them and bring them up to date?</P>
    <P>I wonder would I be doing Deputy Dr. Browne an injustice if I were to say that what he really wants is a complete socialisation of medicine, and that every suggestion he makes in this House is really designed to get his foot in the door and gradually to force on all of us a complete system of socialised medicine such as operates at present in Great Britain?  He nods his head in agreement.  I think, in view of that, that it is time that this House made up its mind quite definitely on the question&mdash;is that what the rest of us want?  Do we want the whole system of medicine in this country socialised on the model of Great Britain and New Zealand?  It is a legitimate view for those who want to hold it.  I do not. I am against it.  Who is for it?</P>

Deputies, therefore, are getting the opportunity of making up their minds as to the side of the fence on which they want to come down.  The voluntary hospitals are being assailed, and the foot is being put in the door for the purpose of wiping them out.  I am against it. What says the Minister for Health? The dispensaries are being assailed.  It is sought to put a foot in the door and away with them.  I am against that. I want good dispensaries, properly staffed for the people, which they can attend.  Will the Minister tell us on which side he comes down?  On the larger question, will he start excogitating <Col N="2130" /> so that he can give us a full and coherent explanation of his mind on the subject, with special reference to that significant new feature in the public health charter of Ireland, the £1 contribution which represents, I assume, Fianna Fáil's external relations with Catholic morality or the purchase of orthodoxy with 20 pieces of silver?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>I should like, fair being fair, to congratulate Deputy Dr. Browne on his recovery from his recent violent attack of laryngitis, which prevented him from giving his views in this House on last Thursday on the important matters of health. Having recovered from this attack, the Deputy has come into the House again, the hatchet man charged with the duty of finishing the voluntary hospitals and of adding his voice to the effort to socialise medicine.  I am sure that the Minister for Health&mdash;he is responsible for the maintenance and administration of the law in relation to the voluntary hospitals and, I have no doubt, recognises his complete responsibility&mdash;will resist any attacks on the medical profession, and will deal with Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Counties of Laois and Offaly, which I represent, I should like to know certain things from the Minister.  During the past 12 or 18 months we have heard, in both counties, rumours to the effect that the Minister proposes, shortly, by an Act of this House, to impose an obligation on the county councils of Laois and Offaly to provide institutional treatment for a lot of people for whom such treatment is not being provided now. If that is so, I would like to know what steps the Minister has taken to assist the Laois or the Offaly County Council in improving the dispensary facilities and increasing the number of maternity beds available in both counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that, before the Minister for Health sought by legislation to increase the responsibilities of either of these health authorities, he would have taken steps to ensure that the machinery was already created for the purpose of providing better dispensary facilities and more maternity beds and, as a Deputy representing the <Col N="2131" /> constituency of Laois-Offaly, I would like to know from the Minister what concrete steps he has taken in the last 12 months to ensure that these highfalutin health schemes, when passed by this House, will have some chance of going into operation.</P>
    <P>I know that before the Estimate is passed my colleague, Deputy Peadar Maher, will join me in asking the Minister what assistance has been given to both these county councils in this important task.  I do think that from time to time we in this House are inclined in these matters to put the cart very much in front of the horse's nose and are inclined to legislate <i>de bene esse,</i> without considering what we can do by departmental action to provide something worth while for the people. Accordingly, I would like to know from the Minister in relation to both the counties I represent what action his Department has taken to provide better health services for the people in the last 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Supplementary Estimate largely arises from increased costs which local authorities have had to bear in the course of the year, costs which were probably the inevitable result of the Budget and of the Government's economic policy. However, that is a <i>fait accompli.</i>  I do not suppose there is anything we can do about it beyond paying the bill which arises from the folly of the Government's economic policy.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to feel, however, that in so far as money is required by the Government in order to assist local authorities or to recoup local authorities in the provision of proper dispensary facilities, the House would be unanimous on that question. I am sure, from indications that have been given from time to time from different sides of the House, that the Minister can consider himself as being pressed by everybody in the House to encourage local authorities to provide better dispensary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter that I would like to refer to in regard to dispensary facilities in Dublin.  A new problem arises in the newly-built areas of Dublin. These areas have now reached the <Col N="2132" /> proportions of small towns or even large towns in themselves.  Housing development in these areas has not taken into account&mdash;of necessity, I suppose&mdash;the need for providing dispensaries. A very good step was taken in the Crumlin area in the provision of a clinic.  That is certainly a step along the right lines but, if at all possible, the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council should be encouraged to provide special buildings even in these newly-built areas to serve as dispensaries and clinics.</P>
    <P>There is also the necessity for the provision of round the clock dispensary facilities in those areas.  Where there is a large population, such as there is, for instance, in the Crumlin-Drimnagh area or in the Cabra area, where there are close on 80,000 people living in a fairly restricted area, inevitably, emergency cases will arise 24 hours round-the-clock, emergency cases that may not require hospital treatment but that may require immediate treatment of one kind or another.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to consider the possibility of asking the Dublin health authorities to provide, not merely buildings for use as dispensaries, but also a round-the-clock casualty service in these areas.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to touch on the other matters that have been raised in the course of this discussion.  Any suggestion that the voluntary hospitals, which are in the main run by religious Orders which have rendered valuable service to the country for a long time, should be nationalised would not be received with favour by the Minister or, indeed, by anybody else in the country.  I, therefore, do not take the suggestion made by Deputy Dr. Browne as being very serious in that respect but I would urge the Minister to do everything he can to encourage local authorities to improve dispensary facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the last speaker had been here when I was opening this debate he would have known that the necessity for this Estimate is not due to any economic policy of the Government but is largely due to a turf scheme sponsored in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>What scheme?</P>

    <Col N="2133" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in 1951, sponsored a turf scheme.  First of all, as we know, they urged the local authorities to cut two or three years' turf in one year.  I have not any fault to find with that advice.  If the Government thought at that time that they would be up against any serious danger, they were quite entitled to do that.  But, obviously, the carrying over of that turf was not a very economic proposition.  Secondly, it was put into a separate account by the local authorities and it is only recently that that account has been allocated between the various services and the health services must now pay their share and that is largely responsible for this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>There was a good deal of talk about dispensaries.  I mentioned here when I was talking about the Bill last week that there were something like 400 dispensaries or dispensary depots in the country which are in need of replacement or repairs.  I mentioned, also, that the local authorities have been urged for many years to do that job but that they were very slow about it and, last May, I introduced a scheme to local authorities asking them to provide very simple buildings which I think will be quite adequate, which will provide the necessary number of rooms for doctor and nurse, pharmacy, waiting room and will also provide heating and water.  I asked the local authorities to adopt this plan&mdash;there were three or four alternatives more or less on the same lines&mdash;for the dispensaries and I told them that I would be prepared to give a grant up to 50 per cent. but not exceeding £600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>£600 towards each dispensary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The estimate was that these particular buildings could be erected for much the same price as a labourer's cottage.  In fact, I have seen some of the estimates, and they range around £1,000 or £1,100.  The reports show that something like 300 dispensaries will be built in the near future under this scheme, and that should make a very big difference in the general dispensary level throughout <Col N="2134" /> the country.  We could hardly expect that that work would be performed since last May.  I know that practically all the local authorities have work on hands of this kind.  We might expect to see some results in the next six or 12 months; to see a number of these completed and to see some of the fruits of the scheme put up to them.  As I mentioned last week, I intend to continue to press local authorities to renew all these old and bad dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any indication of what he expects the local authorities in Dublin to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The dispensaries in Dublin would naturally be very much bigger.  The intention is to provide clinics at certain points in the City of Dublin&mdash;I could not exactly say just where at the moment.  As Deputies are aware, in these clinics there would be more than the ordinary dispensary work carried out; that is more than the examination of the patient and prescribing for the patient.  There would be some specialist work done in these clinics.  There would be a wider service, as it were, given.  But, generally speaking, the dispensaries will continue to do the work they are doing.  It is intended to provide dispensaries in the new areas.  In Crumlin area I think the dispensary has been erected.  The same thing will apply to the other new areas also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, of course, led some Deputies to the point that the Hospitals' Trust Fund is getting low.  It is getting so low that it will disappear by the end of this month.  I do not want to go into it here because it is not strictly in order, but the Book of Estimates will be in Deputies' hands in a few days' time and they will probably be rather appalled when they see the total.  But the biggest single item added to the Estimates this year is a hospital grant which for the first time will have to be provided by the Minister for Finance.  The Hospitals' Trust Fund has been exhausted, but it will be renewed from year to year by the amounts which come in.  As one Deputy remarked, that will not go much further than meeting the <Col N="2135" /> hospital deficits and the money for capital works, for sometime to come anyway, will have to be found by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked what were the improved services I mentioned in this Estimate.  Of course they are general. Improvements in building would not exactly come under the Estimate&mdash; they would come under the capital items&mdash;but the other services include the upkeep of premises, the provision of more beds in some hospitals, the adding of specialists to their staff by a number of local authorities, and the cost of drugs which appears to be increasing, probably because they are using more expensive drugs and not that the people are getting more drugs.  The drugs are becoming more expensive.  Various items of that kind have to be covered by these improved services.</P>
    <P>There was quite a lot of discussion about the position of the nurse, in particular the status and the remuneration of the midwife.  It is an extremely difficult problem.  I have sympathy with the position in which midwives find themselves, just as some Deputies have, but it is very hard to justify paying a full-time salary to a person who gets very little work to do.  Some midwives appointed to dispensary areas in the last few years had only one or two cases during the year.  Some of them, of course, had more, but it is hard to justify a full-time salary for them.</P>
    <P>I admit that the salary is not sufficient for a person to live on, but it must be remembered that the employment of a midwife is only part-time, the same as the dispensary doctor.  A dispensary doctor is naturally expected to earn something outside his dispensary work in order to keep himself going and the same applies to the midwife.  Admittedly, she does not earn very much.  Other things apply to a midwife that do not apply to public servants generally.  For instance, a midwife can keep her job even though she gets married.  A good many of them are married and are devoting a certain part of their time, <Col N="2136" /> at any rate, to running their houses or, perhaps, a business which they may have married into.</P>
    <P>It is a very difficult problem and I should like to be able to find a solution. Eventually, of course, the solution will be that nurses appointed in future to districts will be general nurses as well as having the qualifications of a midwife so that they will be employed full time.  They will be employed for general nursing duty in the district and will carry out a midwife's duty as well. Therefore our problem will only relate to the midwives who are there at the moment.  I can assure the House that it is a problem to which I have given great thought, but I do not see any easy solution for it.  I promised to be sympathetic if any practical solution could be suggested.</P>
    <P>One Deputy spoke of ante-natal clinics and the necessity for them.  I agree that they are a very necessary part of our medical services.  When the Health Bill has gone through and is implemented, we hope it will be possible to get the local authorities to provide these ante-natal clinics.  They will start, of course, with the cities and the bigger towns and gradually I hope extend to the small towns and even to centres other than the small towns. That may take some time, but if each county tackles the business by starting a few clinics in the towns and gradually covering the county I will be satisfied. When the Bill is put through I think we will be able to get that scheme going all right.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked about the position in regard to turf.  He said that he found a lot of the money was due to the purchase of turf.  The policy of the Department of Health since it was set up in 1947 has always been to get local authorities to use turf.  When I am sanctioning a grant for a local authority hospital a condition is always inserted that they must put in first-class equipment to burn turf and the local authorities have carried out that injunction faithfully and, I think, willingly in nearly every case.  In the case of voluntary hospitals, I am not in such a strong position.  I can only persuade them to the best of my ability and, if they refuse, I can go no further. <Col N="2137" /> It has happened that though we have tried to persuade voluntary hospitals obtaining grants for the improvement, extension or building of hospitals to use turf they have not done so.  In view of some of the speeches we have heard here I take it the Dáil would not like to have power given to the Minister to use compulsion.</P>

It was actually fixed, I think, in the case of 24 authorities.  There are altogether 31 and that leaves seven in which it has not yet been fixed definitely.  As far as the Department is concerned, we are very anxious to clear this up.  I take it the Deputy is speaking for a particular county.  If that is so there must be some difficulty in the way.</P>

If a very good case was made and if it was clearly shown that that step would make for an improvement in health services, I think the matter should be considered. As this is the first occasion on which such a suggestion has been made I take it the House does not expect a definite reply now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked about the post-graduate school in St. Kevin's. There is a clause in the Bill dealing with post-graduate education in St. Kevin's and the matter can perhaps be more appropriately discussed under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think so.  The medical profession took this in a very sensible way.  They tried it out first of all on nurses and medical students and on people that I might describe as the ancillary classes of our medical services.  In that way it spread out. It has been very well received in some places.  We cannot, of course, say yet that it is a definite preventive, but the indications are that it does prevent tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked what have we done with regard to the provision of better services in Laois and Offaly. I cannot say that we have done any more there than elsewhere.  The services generally are extending. Buildings are being improved.  I hope dispensaries will be improved.  Expert staffs are being appointed in the various counties and all the time health services are being extended.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The three Supplementary Estimates which I am submitting for the approval of the Dáil to-day are rendered necessary by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act provided for the unification of the existing insurance schemes relating to national health, unemployment and widows' and orphans' pensions into one scheme with one fund and one stamp covering all the services formerly covered by the separate schemes.  This unification of the former <Col N="2140" /> schemes took effect on the 5th January of this year under an Order made by me and the Social Welfare Act, 1952, is now fully in operation.</P>
    <P>As a result of this a token Supplementary Estimate for £10 is required this year for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare in order to provide for increases in the cost of postage and advertising arising out of the implementation of the new Act, which are offset by an increase in the amount appropriated in aid of the Vote from the new Social Insurance Fund and by certain savings on other sub-heads.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1952, in addition to making provision for the unification of the existing insurance schemes also made provision for substantial increases in the various benefits, pensions and allowances hitherto payable under the Acts relating to both insurance and assistance schemes. One of the most important of these schemes is that covered by the Old Age Pensions Acts, and here various improvements were made which resulted in increased payments to pensioners. The existing rates of pension were increased generally by 1/6 per week as from the 4th July, 1952, and a new means table was introduced as from 2nd January, 1953, under which a person whose means amount to £52 10s. per annum can obtain the maximum pension of 21/6 per week, and a person with yearly means up to £104 15s. can get the minimum pension of 6/6 per week.</P>
    <P>The benefit which has accrued to a large number of pensioners from this new means table can perhaps best be illustrated by the fact that prior to its coming into force 15,252 persons had pensions less than the maximum of 21/6 per week.  These had pensions of 16/6, 11/6 and 6/6 per week.  As from the 2nd January, 1953, 14,386 of these became entitled to the maximum pension, leaving only 866 in receipt of a pension less than the maximum, and these were receiving pensions of 16/6 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition, a considerable number of persons whose means exceeded £65 5s.  per annum but did not exceed <Col N="2141" /> £194 15s. per annum have, since 2nd January, 1953, become entitled to pensions of from 6/6 to 16/6 per week. These people were formerly not entitled to any pension.</P>
    <P>Further improvements effected by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, were that the first £80 per annum of a military service pension and the first £52 5s. per annum of voluntary or gratuitous payments are disregarded when assessing the means of pensioners.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the various provisions which I have mentioned will result in an increase of expenditure on old age and blind pensions in the current financial year of £541,000, and I am asking the Dáil to provide this amount.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1952, filled a long-felt want by increasing the amounts payable in sickness and disablement benefits under the National Health Insurance Acts where the recipient of these benefits was married and had a family dependent on him or her.  Thus a married man with two children received 50/- per week in benefit after the 5th July, 1952, as compared with 22/6 or 15/- per week before that date.</P>
    <P>During the first quarter in which these increased amounts were payable, that is, from the 7th July, 1952, to the 5th October, 1952, the increased expenditure arising from them was to be recouped to the National Health Insurance Fund by the Exchequer, and it is to provide for this recoupment that I am now asking you to approve of the Supplementary Estimate for £214,400 for national health insurance which is before you to-day.</P>
    <P>If there is any further information in connection with these three Supplementary Estimates which Deputies would like to have I will do my best to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has agreed that the three Estimates be taken together.  I am sorry that the Minister in introducing the first Estimate on the Order Paper, No. 60, did not give the House more information with regard to the increased sum required for advertising by his Department. I do not know why this House <Col N="2142" /> was asked to vote money to the Minister to enable his Department to advertise.  I am sure that the sum of £350,000 being asked in the Supplementary Estimate for the purposes of advertising is not usual.  It is not so very long ago since the Minister's Government and Party had to fight three by-elections in this country.  It is less than 12 months ago and during the course of these three by-elections the Minister's Party used the Department of Social Welfare for political purposes by advertising extensively in the provincial Press, in Mayo, Waterford and Limerick, the benefits that were supposed to accrue to recipients and claimants for old age pensions, to the many thousands of unemployed, in relation to unemployment assistance and to various classes of voters who might be affected by the sudden appearance in their local papers of advertisements by the Department of Social Welfare telling them what a great new deal the Fianna Fáil Government were giving to them.</P>
      <P>That was a scandalous abuse by the Government Party, for political purposes, of the functions of the Department of Social Welfare.  It could not have been excused on any pretence whatsoever.  It was unusual for any Government Department to advertise so extensively in the provincial Press. No case could have been made for that particular form of advertising except the case of expediency.  The very life of the Government was threatened in these three by-elections and accordingly precedent was thrown to the winds and the local newspaper editors in these three constituencies got Government advertisements that they never got before.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised in the Dáil by Parliamentary Question.  The Minister told the Dáil in defence that his Department was anxious to advertise the new&mdash;and he would like to have said unexpected&mdash;benefits that were coming to the people on and after the 31st July, 1952, and that, accordingly, he took the unprecedented step of bringing these benefits home to everyone by advertising not merely in the daily Press but also in the provincial Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> That was fair enough so far as it went.  It was inclined to be accepted by this House when that reply was given some seven or eight months ago. The ways of Government Departments are extraordinary because precedent is a thing precious to most Government Departments.  There was no precedent in the Civil Service for advertising extensively in the provincial Press and when the month of January, 1953, came about new unexpected benefits by our legislation were being conferred on the people of this country.  The second half of the Social Welfare Act came into operation and, strange to say, there were no advertisements carried in the provincial newspapers in North Mayo, in East Limerick and in the county of the constituency of Waterford.  Such advertisements as were published by the Department of Social Welfare consisted of one run in the <i>Irish Press,</i> of course, and the <i>Irish Independent;</i> I do not know whether anything was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> or not; the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> I hope, carried its proper share.</P>
    <P>Why was that?  It was because when the month of January came about there were no by-elections threatening the ministerial life of the holder of the office and accordingly it was not necessary to reach every homestead in this country advertising the benefits of the Social Welfare Act.</P>
    <P>We have been, as the Minister well knows, a very patient and constructive Opposition but I want to protest against the singular abuse by the Minister of the functions of his Department.</P>
    <P>He misused the Department and departmental advertising for political purposes when these three by-elections were being fought.  He comes into the Dáil now asking the taxpayer to foot a bill for Fianna Fáil election expenses to the tune of £3,500.  I think that is a bit thick.  Certainly one would have expected from the Minister, in introducing this Supplementary Estimate, some effort to explain his extraordinary conduct, and I think it would be wrong if this Estimate were passed without some protest in regard to the <Col N="2144" /> matter.  People have their own views with regard to what happened.  I have no doubt that the abuse of Government advertising which was carried out in those by-elections will receive its due penalty in due time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other two Supplementary Estimates moved by the Minister, no opposition, of course, will be raised to the increased money sought in relation to old age pensions. I am very glad to hear from the Minister that there are now in this country fewer than 1,000 old age pensioners&mdash;at least there were when the modification of the means test came into operation&mdash;in receipt of less than the full pension.  I think that will be welcomed by Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister asks for an additional sum for national health insurance. Might I raise this matter on behalf of Deputies on all sides of the House because it is a perennial complaint&mdash; the persistence of delay in decisions on national health claims?  I know this has been raised from time to time, and I would urge on the Minister, now that the administration of national health insurance is part of the Civil Service functions in his Department, that some effort should be made to expedite decisions in these cases.</P>

      <P>The National Health Insurance Society due to the foresight of Deputy Norton, as Minister for Social Welfare, was absorbed by the Department of Social Welfare some three years ago in order to ensure that when the comprehensive social insurance scheme came into operation there would be no time lag.

      <P>I urge on the Minister to turn his mind from Tulyar and matters of that kind and get down to putting a little bit of effort into expediting consideration by the national health insurance section of his Department of the particular claims that fall to be considered.  Despite the levity displayed by certain Deputies, the facts are that unfortunate claimants, who do suffer illness and unemployment and who make claims for benefit, find that it takes a considerable length of time before a final decision is given as to whether they are entitled to benefit or not.  I cannot see why that should be so.  Our courts of law each day and each week give pretty speedy justice to litigants in far more complicated sets of facts than whether a person is or is not ill or has or has not paid proper contributions. I certainly do not see why it should take as long as 12 months, from time to time, before a final decision is given by the Department as to whether a particular person is entitled to benefit or not.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter into which he should inquire with the determination that the same speed should be observed in the investigation of national health insurance cases as is observed in dealing with other claims in the Department.  In that connection I should like to say that as a Deputy I find that the administration of the old age pension section of his Department has improved considerably as a result of the efforts of his predecessor. That improvement has been carried on by the present Minister. Certainly even when there is an appeal against the decision in an old age pension claim, the matter is dealt with finally in a very short space of time. I cannot understand why the same set of circumstances should not apply in national health insurance cases.</P>

      <P>While I am aware that a general discussion is not allowed on this Vote on the administration of the Department, I should like to make a few comments.  I believe that the manner in which aged people in this country are provided for is very significant.  One section is provided with very substantial allowances. <Col N="2146" /> Together with those allowances they are also provided with gratuities.  Those are the people who formerly occupied sheltered positions, State employees and others.  I cannot see for the life of me why these sections of the community should enjoy privileges while the backbone of this country, the small farmer and the working man are not allowed similar privileges.</P>

      <P>I am trying to be as brief as I can.  We are dealing with the Supplementary Estimate of £542,000.  I was just making comparisons with the manner in which other sections are treated.  What is significant is that we provide not alone pensions but allowances for those people who are deemed to have completed their service to the State and who have gone into retirement.  I believe this old age pensions measure was first introduced in the year 1908 and it was definitely a very advantageous system. Deputy Davern mentioned that the Social Welfare Department was going through a revolutionary period.  He is not very far from being correct in that respect because the previous Minister, Deputy Norton, initiated that revolution. I believe it cannot be stopped until some measure of justice and fair play is got for the sections which benefit under it.  I remember the time &mdash;I suppose Deputy Davern remembers it just as well as I do&mdash;when old age pensioners had to go to the home assistance officer and they were allowed an extra 2/6 home assistance by your man.</P>

      <P>I was merely commenting on a remark by a previous Deputy.  However, it is quite true and correct that the previous Minister brought in a number of measures which were exceptionally beneficial for that <Col N="2147" /> section of the community which has to live on old age pensions.  The Minister seems to be laughing at this but these people had to make paupers of themselves and run to a county councillor or a T.D. to ask him to approach the local home assistance officer to see that he would give them an extra 2/6 weekly before Deputy Norton took up office.</P>

      <P>No one could object if this Supplementary Estimate was much more substantial than the figure of £542,000.  I know that any money paid out in old age pensions or for any other type of allowances must come out of the people's pockets.  I know that money does not fall from heaven in this country.  No money is available from any other source but from the people's pockets.  If one section get extra benefits the community must provide for those benefits.  I claim that the old age pensioners are not getting their rightful allowance in comparison with other people.  No one will contend that the old age pensioner has been treated by any Government in this country in a fair and just way.</P>
      <P>The way he is being treated does not at all compare with the way in which the people I have mentioned have been dealt with.  The privileged sections of the community have not to undergo any rigid means test.  There is no counting the number of hens they may keep.</P>

      <P>Surely no one will contend with the present diminishing value of money that 21/6 a week is a fair allowance for any man to live .  A man of 70 years is not in a <Col N="2148" /> position to supplement that by doing other work.  I think it is very much out of place to ask a man of 70 years of age to exist on a sum of 21/6 per week.  There may be some case for it if other sections of the community were similarly treated, but, as I have said before, that is not the position. Other people get £9 or £10 a week, and when they retire a four-figure retiring gratuity is usual.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I transgressed, but I speak to the Estimate when I refer to the inadequacy of the present old age pension allowance.  I would like&mdash;I think every other member of this House as well as myself would also like&mdash;to see some further legislation having particular regard to the diminishing value of money to enable this House to pass a further increase for the old age pensioners.  I believe there is no section of the community more entitled to those increases than that particular section.</P>
      <P>I would like to impress upon the Minister that the greatest sufferer under the means test imposed in this measure is the worker's wife who happens to be older than the worker himself.  I feel sure that matter has been brought to the notice of the Minister before.  If the wife of a man who is working with a farmer or with a county council for £4 5s. a week happens&mdash;it does happen in some cases &mdash;to be older than the man himself and she arrives at the pension age before he ceases to work that woman, although she may be living in grave hardship in a cottage without an acre of land, cannot get one single penny pension.  There are a number of those cases from Donegal to the Mizen Head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that during its 30 years of existence this House has not devised some measure that will help such people.  It is very difficult for any member of this House or any public representative to explain to a woman living in a cottage without a penny <Col N="2149" /> other than the £4 5s. a week which her husband is earning to maintain herself and his family why she is not entitled to a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I know that discussion is very limited on a Supplementary Estimate, I would like to get information on a matter which I believe is quite appropriate on this Estimate.  I refer to the change in the system for dealing with pension appeals.</P>
      <P>I believe some change has recently been made by the Minister and his advisors.  Heretofore it was possible for a member of this House to approach directly the deciding officer dealing with those appeals.  The Minister has now put that approach completely and entirely out of the way.  The only person so far as I know at the present a Deputy can approach is a person who has no function whatever to allow an appeal.  He is a kind of a Sydney Stanley, a contact man who is supposed to take your views and pass them on to the Central Pensions Appeal Board, a very high sounding name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that has always been Fianna Fáil policy.  I was not a member of this House in 1946, 1947 and those years but the same position operated.  Fianna Fáil denied to the people elected by popular vote the right to approach and put their case personally before the State officials at that time.  That was changed by our capable Deputy, Deputy William Norton.  When he became Minister for Social Welfare he established a right for every Deputy to approach and discuss on a personal basis with the deciding officer any relevant facts on a particular claim.  I believe that was <Col N="2150" /> an admirable way of doing business and a system that should not have been changed, but this dictatorial outlook of the present Minister&mdash;and I am sorry to say it, because in other ways he is quite a good man&mdash;prevents any Deputy from approaching the Pensions Appeal Board.  They are now a sacred kind of body; I do not know on what pedestal they are but one cannot touch them.  We do not know even where they sit.  I ask the Minister to inform the House clearly his reasons for making such a change in such an admirable way of doing business. Many things may arise on a particular appeal which it would be desirable for a Deputy to put before such an officer. Now it is very difficult for any Deputy to do that, as we are debarred from meeting the deciding officer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be taking things easy, resting on his oars now.  He seems to think this problem does not exist at all.  Everyone knows the old age pension headquarters is in Lord Edward Street. Probably I get different treatment to Deputy Davern.  There is no one to meet me or any other Deputy but a liaison officer, who will take the views and transmit them in writing to the Central Pensions Appeal Board.  I believe the former system was a better one and I would like to know why it was changed.  It is most unfair and most unjust to Deputies that when people approach us and put certain facts before us we cannot put these facts forward clearly and forcibly before the responsible officer.  The present Minister has denied us that right for the past five or six weeks, but I hope that in a very short time he will restore it to us.</P>
      <P>In connection with widows' pensions, the main people I refer to are widows of farmers.  When they apply, their means are assessed on the earning capacity of the farm over the previous 12 months or two years.</P>

We are all very glad to see improvements in the rate of payment to national health patients, but unfortunately&mdash;due, as Deputy Davern said, to the revolutionary change&mdash;delays are taking place.  I feel sure that the Minister, having heard the views of this House on this point, will take steps to see that those delays are cut down as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Finally, I make a special appeal to the Minister to try and get the Minister for Finance to agree to proposals for an increase in old age pensions.  In that he will have the support of every Deputy and of everyone in the country, from Donegal to Cork.  I would also ask him to allow the former system to be restored in regard to appeals, so that Deputies may meet the deciding officer personally.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not in to hear the Minister's speech.  I want to draw attention to the great delays in settling national health cases, unemployment claims and children's allowances.  There have been great delays certainly in the past few months in the payment of national health claims.  When you contact the local office in Cork, you are told they have no records at all of whether the person was paid or not, until the agent comes back from his round, that you can consult him the following morning before eleven, when he goes out again.  The officials in the office in Cork are absolutely helpless.  It is very unfair to keep people waiting six or seven weeks for a settlement of such claims and to find you have no redress at all unless you come to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing is happening with <Col N="2152" /> children's allowances; there are very long delays and they cannot be settled anywhere except in Dublin.  The very same thing happens with any dispute over unemployment claims; they have to be sent to Dublin for some officer to decide.  I was told by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Social Welfare, and also by the present Minister, I think, that very often those cases are dealt with by an official in Dublin who is much junior to the man in charge of the employment exchange in Cork.  Trifling disputes over trifling sums have been the cause of holding up a man's claim for weeks and he is referred to the home assistance officer in the meantime to carry on.  It must be clear to everyone that this whole Department of Social Welfare is too big to be run from the City of Dublin. It is about time we had some authority in the provinces where we would have the deciding officer in a central place, able to decide whether a man is entitled to get his unemployment benefit or assistance or not, without waiting for this routine of letters going up and down.  It is entirely wrong that there should be no record of claims for national health in a place like Cork, where there are so many industrial firms carrying on.  When a man is out sick he has to wait and Deputies and others are told there are no records. That state of affairs must not be allowed to continue.  In the same way, there are numerous delays over children's allowances.</P>

      <P>These cases are causing local Deputies any amount of trouble.  I find that when I come up here and get on the telephone, not to mind interviewing the deciding officer, I can get satisfaction, as a rule; but it is all wrong that a person should have to travel 160 miles to get an affair settled for a man in Cork. I appeal to the Minister to make some arrangements to have those cases dealt with locally, at least in the big centres, and not inflicting hardship on people by leaving them without their <Col N="2153" /> benefit and causing an amount of trouble to public representatives.</P>

      <P>With regard to the time allowed for an appeal against the rejection of applications for old age and blind pensions, as the law stands there is a period of a week allowed for an appeal against the committee's decision.  The Minister will appreciate that, postal services in outlying districts not always being what they should be, there may be considerable delay before a letter arrives.  When the letter arrives, there may be considerable delay before the recipient can get somebody to read it for him and subsequent delay while he waits for somebody to write the reply.  In these circumstances, a week is not sufficient, and it has been responsible for a great deal of hardship, of which I am personally aware.  Admittedly, the Minister has discretion to allow approximately a fortnight, but I feel that, if it were extended to 21 days, it would alleviate a lot of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as old age pensions are concerned, in a country such as ours, with a great Christian tradition, it should be our aim and object to make the latter days of old people as happy as possible.  I admit that there has been an increase recently in the amount of the old age pensions, but everyone will concede that, in the case of the pensioner who lives alone, and even in the case of two pensioners living together, it is extremely difficult for them to live on the sum of money at their disposal nowadays.  I am not making any great point about it, but I ask the Minister to consider that he would be doing only common justice&mdash;and would have the support of all Parties&mdash;if he gave them a small increase to enable them to meet the terrific rise in the cost of living.  If any particular section of the community find themselves up against it, they are protected by a trade union or some other organisation and they look for an increase, but the old age pensioners have no redress.  If the cost of living goes up, they have nobody to fall back upon, so that it is up to Deputies to state the case for them and impress on the <Col N="2154" /> Minister the need for considering their position.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the means test, which in some cases operates too harshly against people.  The Minister ought to consider some amelioration of it.  In the case of a person who has a little money, which he possibly has saved by his own industry and hard work and put aside for his later days, some officer is sent down from the Department&mdash;I am not decrying the officer who is merely doing his duty&mdash; to cut his pension down from the full amount which he is entitled to get from the State.  I suggest that the Minister should look into that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davern spoke about a revolution in the Social Welfare Department, but I am at a loss to discover where it is, because it is sad to see the method of dealing with appeals and national health cases at present.  In order to give the Minister an idea of what I have in mind, I can tell him that no later than last Monday I was asked to act for a young fellow who was unable to leave his bed through illness and to meet the appeals officer with regard to a national health claim.  I am prepared to admit that delay is bound to arise in particular cases, but I met the officer who I found was considerate and efficient but tied up in the usual red tape.  The remarkable feature about this case was that the sick man had handed in 41 certificates, which were there on the file.  I ask any Deputy if there was any justification for making a man wait 41 weeks before the appeals officer decided the matter.</P>
      <P>I have said before that there are a number of national health cases in respect of which I am at a loss to know why there is such a delay in making payment.  I know a case of a man who was out ill for seven weeks and who handed in seven certificates.  He went back to work in the eighth week and he had not received his national health benefit.  I do not agree with Deputy McGrath that the officers in the Cork offices are helpless.  I think we have most efficient officials in these offices and in the labour exchanges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that either, because any time I made inquiries about delays, I found they could put their fingers on the claims almost immediately.  I want to repeat what I have said before on many occasions, that there should be an executive officer to decide these issues.</P>
      <P>I know of a case of a widow with a non-contributory pension whose daughter secured employment and whose pension was reduced because her daughter had gone to work.  She reported the matter to me and I made inquiries.  The official in the Cork office had all the particulars before him and there was no dispute on the facts.  I was surprised to learn after some weeks that the claim had not been decided, and I called into D'Olier House in Dublin and asked who was dealing with cases of the kind from the Cork City area.  I asked the young gentleman to whom I was introduced what was the cause of the delay and he told me that he was preparing a statement for the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle.  Does the Minister think that any such system as that can be efficient?  There was no disputing the facts and yet that case had to come to Dublin to be decided, although, in the last analysis, the deciding officer had to rely on what the responsible official in Cork stated in his report.  I suggest &mdash;I have advocated it for years&mdash;that the time has arrived when the managers of the different Social Welfare Departments should have executive authority to deal with all these cases, and, if a case is to go forward for appeal, let it be put to the appeals officer in reasonable time.</P>
      <P>With regard to old age pensions, I must say that I regret that the amount is not large and I am afraid that every one of us is somewhat thoughtless with regard to the position of old age pensioners.  These people are now receiving 21/6 a week, the purchasing power of which sum, related to what it could buy in 1939, is 9/-, according to what the Taoiseach told us last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask any member of the House to pause and think how he would spend <Col N="2156" /> that 21/6 per week which, at the present value of money, will purchase only 9/- worth of articles.  He is expected to get three meals a day: all he could get would be 1/- for each meal in the week, without anything for clothing, boots or any of the other necessaries of life.  I know of widows who are living alone and who are paying 4/6 a week for their cottage. They have to eke out an existence on what remains of the 21/6.  How can such persons&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;be expected to eke out a living on such a small sum per week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of widows, old age pensioners and those in receipt of national health insurance is extremely difficult.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing so grotesque or absurd as a city Deputy who purports to represent a rural constituency.  We heard Deputy O'Higgins launch a violent attack on the Minister for Social Welfare for daring to advertise the social welfare benefits in the provincial papers.  I think that that action on the part of a Deputy who claims to represent a provincial constituency ought to open the eyes of other Deputies to the situation which is developing in this country in which city men take complete control of the whole of rural Ireland, seek to dictate how things ought to be done in rural Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and seek to misrepresent rural constituencies.  The Minister was perfectly right to advertise the benefits of the Social Welfare Act in the widest possible way.  In <Col N="2157" /> fact, I think there was a moral obligation on the Minister to advertise those benefits.  Those who came into benefit as a result of the passing of the Social Welfare Act are people in a number of walks of life&mdash;agricultural workers, old age pensioners, the unemployed and the sick.  They are entitled to have the benefits conferred upon them by the Social Welfare Act brought to their immediate notice so that they may claim those benefits.  The same remarks apply to the increase in the children's allowances.  Deputy O'Higgins stated that it is adequate to advertise those benefits in the daily Press.  I acknowledge that the daily Press has a very wide circulation in this country and that it is very influential as a medium of advertising.  At the same time, the provincial Press enjoys a wide circulation.  In some areas, particularly in the remote rural areas, it is possible that the provincial Press has a greater influence and is a more effective medium of advertising than the daily Press.  In many cases the weekly provincial paper is the only paper that reaches a home.  In addition, it is often very intensively studied in such homes.  For that reason I think the Minister would have done a great injustice to a large section of the poorer people of this country if he had not advertised the benefits of the Social Welfare Act last year in the provincial papers.  Deputy O'Higgins said that there is no precedent for such advertising.  We all know that there are many such precedents.  We know that many Acts and regulations which affect the people&mdash;particularly the people of rural Ireland&mdash;are invariably advertised in the local papers. Increases in agricultural wages are invariably advertised in the provincial papers.  That is done because the information is intended to reach people in remote rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is no foundation whatever for the absurd suggestion by Deputy O'Higgins that the advertising of the benefits of the Social Welfare Act in the provincial Press had a political foundation.  It must be remembered that the benefits of the Act are very far-reaching.  In many cases the benefits to the sick and the unemployed were doubled.  There was <Col N="2158" /> a substantial increase in children's allowances and, as well as that, the system of payment was altered.  It was absolutely essential that these facts should have been brought to the notice of the people concerned in a very clear way; otherwise an injustice might be done to them inasmuch as they might not be aware of the benefits to which they were legally entitled.  For these reasons, I think it was foolish for Deputy O'Higgins to come in here and to make a sort of political charge in respect of an ordinary routine and administrative act.</P>
    <P>Everybody sympathises with the view that the benefits afforded to the aged, under the Old Age Pensions Acts, ought to be improved, where possible.  In the first place, we cannot discuss this matter very extensively on this Supplementary Estimate and, secondly, we ought to realise that a substantial amount is being done.  In this Supplementary Estimate we are asking for £500,000 on top of £8,290,000: in other words, we are now paying out almost £9,000,000 in old age pensions alone.  I have not the figures for other years, but I believe that they would reveal that the present expenditure represents a considerable increase on that of previous years and that, every year, we are stepping-up the benefits and the expenditure under this heading.</P>
    <P>Many comments have been made to the effect that 21/6 is an inadequate reward to the aged.  In that regard it can be said that old age pensions have been increased by 4/- per week since the change of Government took place two years ago and, having regard to the difficulties of the financial position, I think that is a substantial concession. While a large number of old age pensioners have other sources of income&mdash;to the extent, at any rate, that they receive assistance in some form or other from their families&mdash;a number of old age pensioners, perhaps only a small number, are entirely dependent on the old age pension, and I would recommend that particular minority to the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  I do not intend to say any more in regard to that matter now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> I should like to see the agricultural worker and the man in the low wage group automatically receive the old age pension when he reaches 70 years of age irrespective of whether or not he has been working up to his seventieth birthday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little that I have to say except that I am in full agreement with the remarks made by Deputy Hickey, Deputy McGrath, Deputy Esmonde and Deputy M.P. Murphy to the effect that it would be to the benefit of the people in the rural areas if the Minister were to agree to have greater decentralisation. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us the number of cases in which appeals were taken by the appeals officer against the decision of the local committees, and the number of appeals dealt with at headquarters where the full amount was given in spite of the appeal brought against the local recommendation.  That information would tell us the amount of money that is being spent on bringing objections to pensions granted by the local committees.</P>
      <P>Speaking from experience, I deplore the present idea of moving back to the system of an appeals board.  I think it only fair to say that I believe the officials in Dublin approach the hearing of appeals from a human point of view. I cannot recall any instance where they adopted the attitude of cutting down, if possible, the amount of a pension. I realise, of course, that they must act on the instructions not of the Minister but of the Government which lays down a certain fixed standard for dealing with border-line cases.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy M.P. Murphy that no matter how well-intentioned the members of an appeal board may be, there could be occasions when it would be of great assistance to them if they could be made aware of the local circumstances on which appeals are based.  That information is not always made readily available to them by the local officer bringing the appeal against the original decision in favour of a claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that, since 1948, the <Col N="2160" /> approach of appeals officers has, in many cases, improved.  The Minister, when giving advice to them, should lay emphasis on the fact that in dealing with border-line cases, they should consider all the facts and see that the benefit of the doubt went to the applicant rather than to the local appeals officer.  I believe that while, on the whole, the officials are well-intentioned, the fact is that at times in rural Ireland, we come across the odd official who has his eye constantly fixed on the horizon of promotion.  Consequently, he believes in dealing drastically, not with human beings but with &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; as he regards those whose claims for the old age pension come before him.  That is not a befitting way for an official or anyone else to deal with the claims of old age pensioners.  That approach should be based from the Christian viewpoint.</P>
    <P>This question of decentralisation, is of primary importance to the people in rural Ireland.  There is an appeals board in Dublin.  What case, therefore, can there be for not setting one up in Cork, in Galway for the West and in other important provincial centres? Why send all the cases to Dublin when they could be more satisfactorily dealt with locally?  Surely, the Minister could find within his Department a number of officials who could deal as conscientiously with these appeals in the different centres throughout the country as they do in Dublin.  If that were done, the people would be better satisfied.  If one takes an appeal of any kind, one can say this, that there is the feeling in the rural areas that if it has to be decided in Dublin everything is already lost.  People have the feeling that their case will not be considered in Dublin in the way they would like it to be considered.  I believe that if appeals were heard locally by the higher officials, there would be greater satisfaction amongst the people concerned, with the added advantage that appeals would be disposed of with greater speed than at present.</P>
    <P>I do not know what advice has been given since the present Minister took over, but I know that, when Deputy Norton was the Minister in this <Col N="2161" /> Department, he laid emphasis on the fact that the approach of the appeals officer should be a humanitarian approach on the grounds that in 99 cases out of 100 the applicants were not looking for anything to which they were not entitled.  Previously, some appeals officers did not approach these problems in that light.  There might be the danger now that they would revert back to that position.  If that should happen it would adversely affect the lives of many of our people who, in the vast majority of cases, are honest and just in respect to the claims which they make.  I would appeal to the Minister to instruct his appeals officers that, when dealing with appeals brought against decisions of the local committees they should do so in a manner befitting officials in a Christian country.</P>

      <P>In my constituency during the past four to six months I found complaints about delays in the payment of disability benefit that certainly did not reach me before.  I do not know whether it is a coincidence. I do know if there were the same delays before&mdash;but that they did not reach me&mdash;the position is that in the last four months particularly, from about November, I have received many more complaints about delay in regard to the payment of benefit in County Kildare than had been put to me previously. There was a question in regard to one specific instance on the Order Paper last week where a man had been seven weeks without payment of his disability benefit.  There was another case in Monasterevan where the man concerned had to be taken to the county hospital.  I am sorry to say that he had to be taken there because of real need, where the case was one where benefit was definitely due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are undoubtedly at present cases of delay in the constituency and the Minister should take steps to ensure that delay will be eliminated and the benefits paid.  They are, of course, the type of case more than any other where need is not merely great but is urgent.  The Minister will appreciate that much more than I do, undoubtedly, and it is the type of case <Col N="2162" /> that requires immediate attention.  If it means, so to speak, taking certain shock troops out of the Department and sending them in to clear up an area, if the problem is confined to County Kildare, I hope the Minister will do something to ensure that payment can be made immediately.</P>

      <P>I shall deal first with the matter raised by Deputy O'Higgins. I was asking for certain money for advertising and he accused me of using money for advertising in Mayo, Waterford and Limerick during the by-elections there.  Advertising was done in the local Press and in the daily Press at that particular time, admittedly, but no more was done in Waterford, Limerick or Mayo than was done in any other county in Ireland.  It was necessary because there were 800,000 people affected by the new insurance scheme and the benefits were all coming in around the first week of July.  The Party opposite moved to have the election fought around that time.  I think they made a valiant attempt to have the polling before the new benefits came in.  As a matter of fact, they did say, off the public platforms, that the people should not believe in these new benefits because they would never come and the advertisements had to be put in to tell the people that the new benefits were coming to them whether a by-election was being fought or not.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, I have to carry on my business whether there is a by-election being fought or not, and the fact that there is a by-election being fought cannot prevent me bringing to the <Col N="2163" /> notice of certain individuals that they are entitled to certain benefits and therefore should apply for them.</P>
      <P>That advertisement was put in practically all the local papers&mdash;not all&mdash; and in all the daily papers because there were 800,000 people affected. Deputy O'Higgins wanted to know why the same thing was not done in January.  The number affected in January was only a few thousand people.  As a matter of fact, the 15,000 people who were getting less than the full old age pension did not need to see the advertisements, because the officers looked after them and gave them the old age pension when they applied for it because they knew what their means were.  I got several letters.  I got one letter from a local paper threatening me that they would never report me again if I did not give them an advertisement in January and I wrote back and said I would have to put up with that and I did put up with it.  I suppose they will report me again.  Maybe it would not do me any harm if they did not.</P>

      <P>With regard to the complaints about delays in dealing with national health insurance claims.  I quite admit that there was very great delay and very great confusion in two particular directions&mdash;national health insurance and children's allowances. The reason was that the whole thing had to be re-examined.  Any claim under national health insurance that came in had to be re-examined to see whether the person had dependents or not because up to that stage, it made no difference whether a man had dependents or not, he got the same amount.  The same applies in respect <Col N="2164" /> of children's allowances: the thing had to be re-examined with regard to the number in family.  There were very big delays there also.</P>
      <P>I was principally responsible, I am afraid, for this.  I tried to get this whole scheme through without increasing the staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  We added no staff whatever and at the same time I said to the Department, &ldquo;You must put these new schemes through and get them into working order as quickly as possible.&rdquo;  They did.  They did their best.  There was a great deal of confusion, I admit.  There was no extra staff.  As a matter of fact, we are facing the coming year now with a lower staff than we had last year.  I think it is a great credit to the Department that they have tried to do things in that way.  I am told by the Department that for the last four or five weeks things have come back to normal.</P>
      <P>There will be always certain cases, of course, where delays will occur because there may be something wrong with the claim, sometimes, perhaps, due to the Department but very often due to the insured person, because the card is not properly stamped, or something like that, and it means a long delay.  But, apart from that odd case that will occur, I am assured by the Department that we are back to normal and if Deputies have complaints to make I would like very much that they would let me know what they are. I am very anxious to get this whole scheme working smoothly and I do not want to have people who are sick and who are depending on the money having to wait for it.  I would like to see the whole machine running as smoothly as possible and I would welcome complaints from Deputies about individual cases and maybe it would help me to get things going better in future.</P>

It is extremely difficult to work the system unless the card is kept in some central office, and that, of course, will be, for the present anyway, Dublin. I am afraid it would create a great deal of confusion.  Deputy Hickey or any other Cork Deputy&mdash;Deputy McGrath&mdash;may say to me why not leave the Cork cards in Cork and put a responsible man there who will pay any claims that arise, whether they are sickness benefit, unemployment benefit or whatever they may be.  To some extent that may work all right, but there is a fair amount of movement of people from other counties into Cork, and we all know there is a fair amount of movement of Cork people away from Cork, and every single case that arises like that will cause interminable delay and confusion if some are kept in Cork and some are kept in Dublin.</P>

I am very anxious to decentralise this Department if I can, and I am considering very seriously&mdash;not on the lines the Deputy has mentioned&mdash; whether a whole service could not be transferred, say, to Cork and Galway.</P>
      <P>We have about five services&mdash;un-employment, sickness, widows and orphans, children's allowances and old age pensions.  I am thinking seriously of whether we could transfer one of these to Cork and one to Galway.  That is the only way in which it can be done.  There is no use trying to decentralise partly when the headquarters are in Dublin.  That is as far as I have examined the matter.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I am hoping to have a referee in Cork to <Col N="2166" /> decide certain cases.  We are doing these things as far as we can.  There has been quite a lot of talk about pension appeals.  Deputy Murphy and other Deputies raised this question. There is a complete change as a result of the Act that was passed.  It is not a regulation in this case, it is the Act which laid down quite a different procedure for appeals.  There is now only one appeal officer and he is responsible for deciding all appeals whether in regard to widows' pensions, old age pensions or whatever they may be. Naturally, of course, one man cannot do it all and he has four or five people working under him.  The idea was to get uniformity, and I think everybody will agree with that&mdash;that if a man in Cork is allowed the old age pension, a man in the same circumstances in Mayo should also get the pension. That is the object of the scheme.  One man is in charge and has a staff under him.  He decides all appeals as uniformly as possible.  In the Act it is laid down that he is to do this in a certain way from the files and, therefore, is not to be compelled to hear anybody on behalf of the particular person concerned.  A liaison officer was appointed to convey anything that might be said on behalf of a particular applicant to the appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think every Deputy will agree that what we want is absolute fair play, that whoever the applicant may be he should get fair play and that no intercession or influence should count on the part of anybody, whatever Party he belongs to.  That is the only way to get real fair play, namely, by having one appeals officer who will decide on what is submitted to him, and I think you will get it under this system. Deputy Norton brought in a Bill in which there was the same provision as was in mine.  I have been accused by certain Deputies of copying Deputy Norton's Bill.  I did do it in that respect.  I am not saying that to bring any trouble on Deputy Norton, but because I agree with him absolutely that that is the fairest system.  Even when I was in opposition I never agreed with approaching the appeals officer.  I often wrote to him, but I never agreed with approaching him or trying to persuade him to give a <Col N="2167" /> pension to which a person was not entitled.  We should aim at a perfectly fair system so that a man who has no T.D. to intercede for him shall have the same chance of getting justice as the man who has a T.D. to intercede for him.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite spoke of some social welfare officers being harsh. Some of them may be a bit harsh, perhaps more harsh than others, but I can assure Deputies that that is not a good mark for any officer, because an officer in the Department of Social Welfare, like any other Department, will not get promotion by being harsh If he wants to get promotion, his record is looked up to see if he is judicious and fair in his reports.  If he is harsh at all times, that will not earn him any good mark.</P>

      <P>All right, we will say impartial. I was also asked by certain Deputies whether the instruction given to these officers in my predecessor's time still holds, that is to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt.  It certainly does.  I think any Deputy will admit that wherever there is any doubt the applicant usually gets his pension.  I think that the whole scheme has been administered in a very sympathetic way and that you could not accuse the Department of Social Welfare of depriving people of benefits to which they were actually entitled. If anybody wished to do it, probably he could make a case that the officers of the Department have sometimes given benefits when they really should not be given, but we will not find very much fault with them for that.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the increased travelling expenses of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The total sum required is £11,500, made up of £10,000 travelling expenses for Teachtaí and £1,500 for Seanadoirí. The figures are, of course, approximate and must provide some small margin in order to ensure that the expenses claimed will be fully met.  I might explain that the expenses will be duly allowed in respect of the mileage travelled.</P>
      <P>The increased travelling allowances which came into force on the 1st April last superseded a scale which had been fixed so far back as August, 1944, that is eight years ago.

      <P>Under the law <Col N="2170" /> Deputies are entitled to have their travelling expenses recouped&mdash;that is, their expenses travelling to and from the Dáil and on public business with Government Departments.  Having regard to the heavy burden imposed upon Deputies we have to allow them to travel at their convenience.  They cannot do that if they have to travel according to the fixed schedules of the public transport.  It is essential that a good deal of latitude should be given to Deputies in regard to the times at which they make their journeys.</P>
      <P>In order that there may be no misunderstanding of the situation outside I should say that, while not all Deputies travel by road because a great number of them do not have to travel at all and therefore do not get any allowances, the Deputies who do travel cover almost 750,000 miles per year.  I am perfectly certain that no Deputy makes an unnecessary journey to Dublin on public business.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy argues from that point of view I will not interfere.  The Deputy was arguing about the Dublin Deputies.  He said no money is provided for them.  That is quite true.  No money is provided for them and therefore their position cannot be discussed under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out the difference that exists as between Deputies representing city constituencies and Deputies representing rural constituencies.  If a Deputy representing a rural constituency works for his constituents, as I am glad to say most of them do, he finds himself in the position that he has to travel 40 and 50 miles every week-end.  In fact he is pretty lucky if he gets away at that. In the city, a Deputy can travel his constituency in a 2d. bus.  No allowance is made to rural Deputies for the type of travel to which I have referred. On the other hand, a premium is placed on Deputies to reside away from their constituency altogether.  A Deputy living in Dublin can pick the nearest point in his constituency to the town he wants to visit and can land himself there from the city.  He has no hotel bill to meet.  He is in a very different position from the Deputy who represents a rural constituency and who resides in that constituency.  I think that matter should be considered very carefully by the Minister.  I think the system of Deputies' allowances and travelling expenses should be recast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think no Deputy should remain silent on this matter.  I agree with what the Minister and Deputy Corry have said, and I appeal to the Deputies representing the rural constituencies on both sides of the House to make their voices heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point on which I would like the Minister to enlighten the House.  This money is being provided because of an increase that has taken place since last April.  It is well to remember that while there is an increase given on the one hand it is being taken away on the other, because the alteration in relation to the horsepower of motor-cars means that though a Deputy may get an increase in one way that increase is taken away from <Col N="2172" /> him in another way.  Can the Minister give us any information on that matter?</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry is correct in his approach.  I am anxious that members should be honest and say what they really believe about this.  A wrong impression exists outside.  That is very true of the provincial newspapers and something should be done to dissipate that false impression.  We all know that even with the present allowance it is not an economic proposition to run a car to Dublin.  Some people may ask why run cars then?  The answer to that so far as I am concerned it is an easy one.  Deputies representing rural constituencies must have cars if they are to do their work for their constituents honestly and to the best of their ability.  We have no alternative other than to drive to and from Dublin.</P>
    <P>If the matter were approached from a common-sense point of view both inside and outside the House I think people would understand the position and be satisfied.  The position is made difficult because of one Deputy complaining about some other Deputy and because one Party is anxious to press for a bigger allowance but is afraid that another Party may make political capital out of that.  That is where all the trouble lies at present.</P>
    <P>I do agree with this Estimate and I am saying it openly.  I believe that if the people outside were told the facts there would be no dissatisfaction in their minds. If they were informed of the financial liabilities placed on country Deputies in this city for three days and nights in the week and if they were told of the cost of coming here and working for the constituency, the people would be quite satisfied, hard as it may seem to them.</P>
    <P>I am also glad the Minister mentioned one point, because, for the last few weeks, many people in different walks of life and in different parts of the country, have drawn attention to what they considered as true, that there was an increase in what they call Dáil Deputies' salaries. The Minister is right in drawing attention to the fact that this money being provided is not an increase for <Col N="2173" /> Deputies under such a heading.  We are dealing with travelling expenses. Finally, if the members in the House are willing to let the people understand the position, irrespective of Party or anything else, and if the provincial newspapers are informed of the facts as regards the financial liabilities placed on country Deputies coming here to serve the constituencies they represent, there would not be half the number of complaints there are at the present time owing to the public being ill-informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right to clear the air as far as talk outside regarding increasing travelling expenses to Deputies is concerned.  As one of the numerous Deputies who travel up from the South by rail, it is well that the public should understand that we are given a railway voucher to obtain our ticket and nothing else.  Any increase that is allowed in our expenses is due to an increased railway fare, which we do not see anyway, because we simply exchange the voucher at the ticket office for a ticket to Dublin.  We get no further allowance, for subsistence or anything else, and I think it is no harm to clear the air in regard to the talk that is current outside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel in regard to matters such as this and points that have been raised here in regard to the expenses incurred by particular Deputies is that it is really a subject that ought to be dealt with in an all-Party way by means of a special committee.  We had the same matter here recently in connection with the committee set up to deal with judicial salaries.  We discovered that although, under the Constitution, the Judiciary are independent and it is desirable that matters relating to them should be dealt with by a special committee, particular Deputies wanted to make it a political issue.  I feel that matters of parliamentary allowances and expenses and matters of judicial allowances and expenses are matters that ought to be dealt with in an all-Party way and not by public debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies are paid an allowance. <Col N="2174" /> It is termed an allowance and it is considered an allowance because it is not subject and it is not considered subject to income-tax.  It is an allowance of £624.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only mentioning it incidentally, and as far as Deputies in Dublin City are concerned that is what they get.  They get no travelling allowances and I am anxious to clear the air up in regard to that.  If the air is to be cleared I want to say that there are no expenses whatsoever provided for them except an allowance of £624 per annum.</P>
      <P>There has been, as has been stated, quite a considerable amount of discussion in the newspapers and among the public to the effect that in an indirect kind of way expenses for Dáil Deputies are being increased.  It is undesirable that that impression should be abroad.  Under the Civil Service rules which apply there is very little likelihood of persons being paid expenses that they do not actually incur.  The expenses that are being paid are certainly necessary expenses and are justified by the amount of travelling that is done.  I have often wondered in regard to Deputies who travel by car to Dublin to meetings of the Dáil, whether it would not be much better if the particular car allowance was given to them for the year and to allow them to expend it any way they liked themselves.  However, that is a matter that could best be considered by some type of all-Party committee of the House.</P>
      <P>My reason for speaking at all was to clear the air as far as Dublin Deputies are concerned.  We are not affected one bit by the Supplementary Estimate which the Minister has brought in and I think it is desirable that that should be made clear to our constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have stated, there appears to be a good deal of misunderstanding in the public mind regarding the increase in travelling allowances.  Many people believe that every mile a Deputy <Col N="2175" /> travels in his car is paid for, whether the allowance be big or small.  I heard somebody say regarding some Deputies living near the city that they were getting something like £6 a week towards the cost of running a car.  In my particular case the increased allowance comes to about 5/- a week towards the running of a car.  That increase is an adjustment compared, I think, with a figure which was determined in 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>1944, but in 1944 I think petrol was about 2/6 a gallon. It is 1/3 a gallon dearer now.  My car mileage to and from the City of Dublin is very small and consequently the allowance to me in respect of car expenses in the year or in the month is very small.  As has been mentioned by one or two of the rural Deputies already, work in the county results in my putting up a very big mileage in the car.  My mileage for 12 months last year was 28,000.  In addition to that, I do six hours per day in the office. Any person putting these facts together can see that, in a larger constituency than mine, Deputies must put up a very big mileage, a mileage much larger than in my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an unusual experience for a Deputy to have to get into his car four or five times a week and travel 30 miles to and from a meeting of some committee or another&mdash;a Red Cross committee, a parochial committee, a cottage tenants' committee, a development association, a Tóstal committee or any of these organisations which normally require the presence of Deputies.  These different organisations feel that Deputies should co-operate with them as public representatives by coming to their meetings.  Sometimes Deputies have more than one meeting to attend at night.  Sometimes they have to attend meetings which might be ten or 12 miles apart.  These are matters that are not taken into consideration when the expenses are being fixed towards the cost of running cars. As I say, the only matter taken into consideration is travelling to and from <Col N="2176" /> the Dáil or to and from a Department once in the week.</P>
    <P>I am glad that an opportunity has been given here to have the matter debated because it enables Deputies from different parts of the country to make known in public the many problems confronting them and the expense involved.  It is quite obvious from what I have said that, apart from the allowance made for travelling to and from the Dáil, Deputies must put their hands into their own pockets to pay for repairs to cars and for the petrol and oil consumption involved in travelling all over their constituencies.  In my particular case the average mileage is over 80 miles, nearly 90 miles, per day.  Sometimes it is well over 100; at other times it is only 50 or 60, but with cars travelling at 30 miles an hour, it does not require many hours' travelling in the day to bring the mileage well over 100.  You must stop frequently at the petrol pump and keep the tank filled in order to do this travelling. The public expect the service which is being given by most Deputies in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Of course, the position in regard to city Deputies is different so far as the car allowance is concerned, but it is very probable that city Deputies incur expenses that have not been made known in this debate.  It is only right, when we are debating allowances, that they should make known the expenses they are obliged to bear which can measure up to the expenses allowed to country Deputies in respect of travelling just to and from the Dáil.  I agree with Deputy Corry that some consideration should be given to Deputies in rural areas.  It would be quite easy for these Deputies to give a list of the meetings which they are required to attend and the Minister for Finance could determine whether attendance at these meetings was proper and whether they were discharging a public duty by going to these meetings.  Deputies are expected to attend all those meetings.</P>

As the matter stands at the moment, unless the employee is employed for the full 12 months on the land and the stamping is done, there is no grant payable.  On a great number of farms it is not easy to just have the whole 12 months.  There are periods of nine months and ten months.  The Minister should advert to that.  There should be some sliding scale given for the period of employment in respect of people employed part-time on the land.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £167,300 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for Primary Education, including National School Teachers' Superannuation and a Grant-in-Aid, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main item in this Supplementary Estimate is the provision of £130,000 under the new sub-head DD <Col N="2180" /> to pay the first instalment of the <i>ex gratia</i> payments in the nature of lump sums which it has been decided to make to pensioned national teachers who retired before 1st January, 1950. National teachers retiring on or after that date are entitled to lump sums under the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme. 1950, viz., 1/30th of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service, up to a maximum of 45/30ths.  It is now proposed to amend the superannuation schemes further so as to allow of payments in the nature of lump sums to those on pension on 1st January, 1950, calculated as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  1/30th of average annual salary for each completed year of pensionable service rendered between 1st January, 1935, and 31st December, 1949, inclusive, and</P>
    <P>(b)  1/100th of average annual salary for each other completed year of pensionable service rendered between 1st January, 1905, and 31st December, 1949, inclusive.</P>
    <P>Payment will be made in three equal annual instalments, except where the total amount payable does not exceed £50, when it will be paid in one sum. The total cost is estimated at £350,000. The amount now provided&mdash;£130,000&mdash; covers payment in full of the sums under £50 at an estimated cost of £20,000, together with one-third of the balance of £330,000, viz., £110,000.  The necessary preliminary work is well advanced and it is hoped to make the first payment before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>An extra £20,000 is needed under sub-head D to meet the ordinary pensions, gratuities, etc., under the superannuation schemes.  It has turned out that the estimate of the amount required for the current financial year was too tightly drawn.</P>
    <P>An additional £8,500 is required for preparatory colleges.  Of this, about £4,000 is attributable to increases in the remuneration of the professorial staffs, which were granted after the Estimate for the current financial year had been prepared.  The balance is due to increases in the cost of board and of books and other requisites.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2181" /> An extra £3,000 is required for van and boat services.  The grant for Protestant van services has been increased by £600 to £4,800.  A new bus service was started last autumn for the conveyance of children from the Finglas district to schools in the city (Gardiner Street Convent for girls and infant boys and St. Joseph's, East Wall for boys) pending the provision of schools in Finglas.  This service will cost about £600 in the current financial year.  The balance of the additional sum required is attributable to an increase in the cost of existing services.</P>
    <P>An extra £3,000 is needed for grants towards the cost of heating and cleaning national schools.  Broadly speaking, the State recoups one-half of the amount spent locally, and it looks as if the provision of £63,000 for the current financial year will be about £3,000 short.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B, Examinations, an additional £1,800 is required to meet the cost of increases in the payments to superintendents, assistant superintendents, oral examiners, etc., given after the Estimate for this year was prepared.  There has also been an increase in the number of candidates sitting for the examinations.</P>
    <P>The extra money for training colleges is needed to meet an increase in the grants to two colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that a sum of £600 was necessary for a new innovation&mdash;a bus service for school children in Finglas this year. I am interested in bus services for school children principally in the Gaeltacht areas where schools have been closed as a result of the falling population there.  In cases where the schools have been closed children may find themselves having to travel four five, or sometimes six miles from the far end of an area.  It can be argued that that would affect only a few families and that there might be only a few families living at such a distance from the school.  It is not the fault of the parents when a school is closed. When a school is closed, provision for transport of the children should be made, at least from the far end of the area, particularly in the Gaeltacht <Col N="2182" /> areas.  Some schools have been closed in my constituency in the Gaeltacht areas within the last 12 months.  I think that is a mistake.  I know the regulations are there and that when the average drops below a certain figure it is deemed advisable to close the school.  Might I point out to the Minister&mdash;I have done so on a previous occasion&mdash;that in most cases the school is regarded as a local centre and closing the school goes a long way towards completely depopulating the area the school served?  Even though the number of children attending falls below the number specified&mdash;I think it is 15&mdash;it is a fatal mistake to close the school.  I would ask the Minister to revise that system completely.</P>

It is the closing that raises the problem of the transport of children in practically all cases.  The difference between the cost of transport and the cost of keeping the school open would not be very great.  I consider it is a serious and tragic blunder to close the school in a case like that.</P>

I think all sides of the House agree that they have been placed at a great disadvantage compared to their brethren who retired and received better benefits after that period.  It is a step in the right direction, although they will not receive the full amount they look for.  Under the circumstances, and as we understand that the Budget outlook is rather grim at the moment, probably the Minister has made the best provision possible.</P>

I want to inquire from the Minister for Education whether the heating systems provided in the schools are maintained through the use of native fuel or through the importation of oil or coal. I want it to be clear that I oppose at all times the use of foreign fuel in any State institution.  I would like the Minister to elaborate a little further for me whether this £3,000 has been devoted to the purchase of native fuel or not.  The total sum involved is £66,000&mdash;that is the revised Estimate for this service&mdash;and whatever portion of that goes to the fuel for heating would give considerable employment on our bogs.  I would urge on the Minister&mdash;perhaps I am pressing an open door&mdash;to ensure that native fuel is used at all times in the schools under his control and in any other institutions for which he may have responsibility.</P>

      <P>The provision of the £600 for transport from Finglas to the City of Dublin is altogether a different matter to that which is raised by Deputy Blowick&mdash;which I do not think concerns this Estimate at all.  I would like to assure the Deputy that it is only as a last resort a rural school is closed.  I am most anxious to keep in operation every rural school but, unfortunately, conditions arise sometimes in which that is impossible.  Wherever it is necessary and feasible to provide transport when a school is closed, that transport is provided.  I would be very interested to get from Deputy Blowick information about any children who have to walk four miles to school.  I think it must be a very unusual case when that happens, and I doubt very much if it happens at all.</P>

Even coal is pretty poor, and until we can make a change in all these fireplaces we will find it impossible to make a proper heating system available to the children.</P>
      <P>My Department was recently pressed very strongly by the local committee to provide an oil burning heater, not in a primary school but in a vocational school in the heart of the bog area. We got into communication with Bord na Móna whose engineers have devised a very satisfactory heating system, which is just as effective as an oil burning system, which costs 50 per cent. less and which involves very little trouble in handling.  So far as we can utilise the inventions of the Bord na Móna engineers in the heating of schools in the future, we will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £70,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>The two most important items covered by this Supplementary Estimate are the acquisition of land for forestry purposes and the employment of labour in the State forests and I propose to refer first to each of these matters.</P>
      <P>There was a balance of over £23,000 in the Land Acquisition (Grant-in-Aid) Fund at the 1st April, 1952, and the provision of £100,000 in the original Vote for this year therefore made available a total af approximately £123,000.  By reference to the trend of expenditure in recent years this sum appeared adequate to meet requirements in the current year.  Expenditure in 1951/52, excluding two exceptional acquisitions, namely, Shelton Abbey and Kinnitty Castle, amounted to only slightly over £72,000 and no similar exceptional purchases were foreseen this year.  Expenditure has, however, proved to be heavier than expected. The total to the 28th February, 1953 was £111,278 and it is now possible that up to £130,000 will be expended in the full year, making necessary the provision of the extra £7,000 inserted in the Supplementary Estimate under sub-head C (1).</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of the year a total of 15,000 acres was acquired of which approximately 13,500 acres are plantable.  It now appears probable that acquisition progress for the full year will have made available some 15,000 acres of plantable land, that is, about the same figure as last year. The higher level of cost is attributable partly to an upward trend in average price following from various causes and to an extent fortuitous.  Several areas containing valuable timber stands have also been taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2186" /> After allowance is made for the current planting programme of 12,500 acres, it appears probable that the plantable reserve will have increased to about 35,000 acres at 31st March next, compared with a figure of 31,700 acres at the corresponding date last year.  This increase will be welcome, but the reserve is still too low by reference to the planting rate.</P>
    <P>The aggregate provision in the original Vote for this year for the employment of forest labour was £680,000 that is, the total of the various labour items in sub-head C (2) and the labour figure in sub-head C (3) (1). This figure was £9,000 greater than the corresponding provision in 1951-52 and £20,000 greater than the actual expenditure in that year.  It is now clear that even this increased provision was inadequate and it is estimated that an additional £57,000 will be necessary. The total expenditure on forest labour will be about £737,000, or some £77,000 higher than in 1951-52.  It is estimated that increases in wages would have involved an additional expenditure of some £40,000 at most for an equivalent volume of work but there has also been an increase in the overall amount of work undertaken and in the level of employment on forestry work.</P>
    <P>The minimum number of labourers employed on forestry work during the current year was 3,338 as compared with 2,389 in 1950-51 and 3,057 in 1951-52.  The maximum so far this year is 3,867 and is likely to approach 4,000 before the close of the year, compared with 3,079 in 1950-51 and 3,646 in 1951-52.  The average weekly number employed this year is provisionally estimated at 3,500 as compared with 2,664 in 1950-51 and 3,342 in 1951-52.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the main Forestry Estimate this year, I gave the House a detailed picture of the policy which the Forestry Division would follow during the year.  I explained that fresh planting would have to be limited to 12,500 acres for reasons related to the inadequate reserves of plantable land and the uneven distribution between forests of such reserves as were available.  I also stressed the serious situation which was tending to develop from the concentration of <Col N="2187" /> effort upon the establishment of new plantations to an extent inimical to the proper care of those already established. The replacement of failures, cleaning of young plantations, weeding, pruning and thinning, and so forth, are all imperative requirements if, at the end of a 50-year rotation, the nation is to reap a good and valuable timber crop.  With the expansion of the planted area in recent years and the approach to the thinning stage of the large area of plantations laid down in the last four or five pre-emergency years, the amount of work to be undertaken under these heads is growing rapidly.  The Forestry Division could not hope to give proper attention to them if the order of the day were that priority was to be given at all costs to the achievement of high annual planting figures to satisfy a mistaken impression that such figures are the sole criterion of progress.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that I went into all this very fully when introducing the main Estimate and made clear the disastrous consequences of inattention to the cultivation and management of the plantations already laid down.  I told the House that I had given directions to the Forestry Division that the arrears of such work must be eliminated as quickly as possible and that the work must get priority for the future, even at the expense of curtailing the rate of fresh planting at busy existing centres.</P>
    <P>I knew it was my duty to give such directions, and I felt sure that, when the matter was put fairly and clearly before the House, every Deputy would support the decision I had taken.  To my regret, however, several Deputies who spoke in the ensuing debate still raised the slogan that we should plant at all costs and irrespective of the demands of our existing plantations. It was alleged that I showed a lack of sincerity and was embarking on a retrograde step by talking of the prior claims of thinning.  I hope these Deputies, if they are in the House now, will ponder over the figures I have quoted in regard to the amount of employment given this year on forestry work.  Before this year is out, <Col N="2188" /> the forest labour staff which usually increases in the closing period of the year and which already totals 3,867 will be almost 4,000, that is, nearly 400 men more than the maximum employed last year, when 15,000 acres were being planted and not far short of 1,000 more than the maximum number employed at any time during the régime of the last Government.</P>
    <P>The reason for this rise in employment is that the Department is fulfilling to the utmost of its power my direction that replacements of failures, cleaning, weeding, pruning and thinning must be given proper attention. More work has been done in the State forests this year than ever before, and by placing the crying needs of the plantations for proper cultivation in true perspective, more progress has been made towards fulfilling the country's timber needs than if I had been prepared to allow the plantations to sicken and deteriorate, so that I could come into the House with the pleasant but misleading news that I was arranging to plant a greater area than ever before.</P>
    <P>Present expectations are that over 600 acres of old plantations destroyed by fire, etc., will have been replaced during the year compared with a forecast of 238 which I mentioned when introducing the main Estimate and that the figure of 7,366 acres which I mentioned in connection with other&mdash;partial&mdash;failure replacements will also be exceeded.  Thorough cleaning has been undertaken in all plantations where small plants had to contend with the growth of grass and other native vegetation. Exceptionally good growth conditions this year made this work all the more imperative.</P>
    <P>Finally, weeding and pruning and road construction in preparation for thinning operations have gone on apace and thinning itself has been accelerated considerably.  It is now expected that nearly 7,000 acres, or perhaps slightly more, will have been thinned by direct labour before the close of the year compared with 4,810 acres in 1951-52. This advance in thinning work is particularly gratifying because the situation in regard to thinnings has been getting out of hand in many forests. <Col N="2189" /> Even with the great progress made this year I have seen plantations within the past couple of weeks in the Wicklow and Slieve Bloom areas which are badly overdue for attention.  I have seen for myself the ill effects on growth of delay in thinning and the difficulties of trying to remedy that situation once overcrowding of the trees has caused them to extend their tops too far upward in the battle for light.  It would be a disgrace to allow that position to continue and I am glad to be able to demonstrate to the House that the work is now receiving the attention it requires.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this aspect of the Supplementary Estimate I should explain briefly how the supplementary sum of £57,000 which I have mentioned as needed for forest labour is made up in the Estimate.  There are increases totalling £88,000 in the provisions for labour under sub-head C (2) (4) and sub-head C (3) (1).  These are offset, however, by savings in other labour heads totalling £31,000, leaving the net excess on forest labour at £57,000.  The adjustment of charge as between different heads follows from the acceleration of work on the cultivation and management of existing plantations.  Expenditure on that work is met from the maintenance and forest timber conversion sub-heads.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Supplementary Estimate for various minor sums required for other items covered by sub-heads C (2) and C (3).  None of the individual amounts is of special significance.  They are, in the main, sums of the type which would be provided by virement if a Supplementary Estimate was not in any event required. The total figure for these items is £20,600, and they represent an excess by £3,500 over the amount of the savings available on items on other than forest labour in the sub-heads. Most of the increases are by way of corollary to the expansion in the labour force, e.g., cartage costs and provisions for tools, etc., under `Materials&rdquo; heads.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B an additional £3,500 is required.  Of this, £2,000 is in respect of additional travelling by foresters in connection with the expanded <Col N="2190" /> programme of work.  The balance of £1,500 is needed because of increases in the rates of travelling and subsistence allowances.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G an extra £1,120 is needed for incidental expenses, the only noteworthy item being an additional £900 for advertising costs.  This is due partly to the introduction this year of more effective newspaper warnings of the fire-danger to plantations in the early summer period, and increases in advertising charges.  The weather turned out to be quite wet and the advertising was not entirely necessary. We could not have foreseen that.</P>
    <P>There are minor savings available from other sub-heads totalling £2,120 and the net amount required for the service as a whole is £70,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister went to great pains to erect a nice screen from behind which he tells us he is very busy at the work of thinning existing plantations, grass cleaning, and so forth, and he warns Deputies not to disturb him at his work.  Let us, however, tear down the screen and have a peep inside.  I do not want to be taken as being opposed to this work.  It is more necessary than the putting down of fresh plantations.  It is obvious that we have no business sowing a crop&mdash; because timber in State forestry must be regarded as a crop&mdash;if we do not bring it to the best possible pitch of maturity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the care of existing plantations, thinning, and so forth, is the principal reason why the planting programme has been cut down.  The two could go hand in hand. While I was Minister for Lands I saw to it that existing plantations got the maximum amount of care, having regard to the amount of money and the labour content at our disposal as well as to the pressure of other work at that time.  The planting programme could be greater.  Last year, the Minister for Finance informed the House that we had to find £8,250,000 for foreign timber.  Most of that timber could be produced at home if somebody, 50 years ago, had embarked on a forestry programme.  That would represent a considerable saving: I <Col N="2191" /> understand that some of the imported timber has had to be purchased with dollars.</P>
    <P>The forestry programme should not be cut down or in any way minimised by a Government except in very extreme circumstances and these do not exist at the moment.  At Question Time to-day, the Minister told me that we have approximately 39,000,000 conifer transplants in the nurseries and 4,500,000 hardwoods.  Later he told me that approximately 3,722 lb. of seeds were sown last year and that 3,000 lb. of conifer seeds are to be sown this year.  I think that that is a mistake and that the Minister will find himself stultified in a few years' time when he wants transplants.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech to-night shows that the big bugbear of forestry&mdash;the acquisition of land&mdash;is easing off somewhat. The figures he read out are a pleasing indication that that particular trouble in the Forestry Department is easing off somewhat&mdash;due, I have no doubt, to increased staff in the administrative section.  By cutting down on the amount of seeds to be planted in the coming spring the Forestry Department will find in three years' time that they have not sufficient transplants for their target for that year.  It is not the year in which you want the transplants that you sow the seeds.  In 1950, 14,000 lb. of tree seeds were sown in the nurseries and the figure for 1951 was 14,200 lb.  That figure has been cut down now to just a quarter. I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that a commission should be established to inquire into the methods by which rateable valuations are fixed and to <Col N="2192" /> make recommendations for the removal of anomalies and injustices and the reform of the system of poor law valuations and that pending the report of the commission no increase should be made in the valuation of buildings because of improvements or extension.&mdash;(Deputy Cogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, when this motion was under discussion, I indicated that I was supporting it.  I drew the attention of the Minister and of the House generally to the fact that, when the proprietor of a business firm makes the slightest alteration in his premises, whether the alteration brings him new business or not, the valuation commissioners increase his valuation.  I suggest, as other members of the House have suggested, that the commissioners should not revalue such improvements until a period of from five to seven years at least have elapsed.</P>
      <P>The businessman who takes his courage in his hands and carries out improvements of that sort is entitled to some consideration.  In many cases he has had to go to the bank and borrow money at the high rate of interest of 6 per cent. in order to be able to do so.  I hold that such a person should get every encouragement from our public representatives, municipal as well as Government.  Such a man is providing employment for those in the building trade who at the moment are so badly in need of it.  I stated in the House some weeks ago that the present position in Dublin is that we have 500 carpenters and 500 painters idle and from 200 to 300 bricklayers unemployed. Those men are thinking of going back to England to get decent employment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that a good deal of that employment is at their own doors at the moment if only business firms in this city and the country generally got a word of encouragement from the Government and our public representatives to embark on alterations and extensions.  What is deterring them is the fear that a valuation will be put on the improvements that will be much greater than is anticipated and with no increase in business resulting from their <Col N="2193" /> expenditure.  I suggest that they should get special encouragement by way of a remission of rates on the new portion of their premises for a period of from five to seven years.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a firm which, because it was Government policy, buys in very costly machinery.  It has to be laid on concrete foundations.  The owner finds that he has to repair the roof or put on a new one in order to protect this new machinery.  I say, without fear of contradiction, that what a person in that position fears most is that his valuation will be at least doubled.  That is why we see so many houses in Dublin with old broken-down roofs.  That applies to business premises, shops and private houses, even to some of the fine old houses of the Georgian period.  You will find the roofs of many of them patched, and patched badly.  On the other hand, if the owners felt that by clearing off the old roof and putting on a decent one the valuation would not be increased, I guarantee we would have hundreds of slaters employed in Dublin City within the next few weeks doing this very valuable work of protecting good rateable property.  Instead we see these grand old houses falling into decay until, in the end, many of them will have to be condemned.  The owners find that it is better for them to keep on drawing all they can out of such property rather than repair it, because they know that it will be condemned in a very short time.  On the other hand, if a couple of hundred pounds were spent on a roof or in making some other part of a house habitable it would be quite good for another 25 years.</P>
    <P>I am asking that some encouragement be given to people with houses or other property to improve.  Apart altogether from the employment which would be given to those in the building trade, employment which is so urgently required, the extensions and alterations to houses and business premises in the city would be of the utmost importance from the point of view of extending the life of those buildings.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government to reconsider the whole position.  I am not asking for a revaluation.  What <Col N="2194" /> that would mean is adding on something or taking on something extra.  For that reason, I should not like to see a revaluation of the city started.  If that were to be undertaken, it would mean that the valuation of premises in the city and country would be increased. All that I am asking is that a person who adds a kitchenette to his premises or builds an additional room will get some assurance that his valuation will not be increased for a certain period&mdash; until such time as he has had an opportunity of getting back some of the money spent in carrying out the alterations.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a person who has a small premises.  His windows may be four by four and perhaps he would like to enlarge them to six by six, ten by ten or 12 by 12, but he will not carry out the improvements because he is afaid that if he does his valuation will be increased, while there has been no increase in the volume of his business. I put it to the Minister that he himself has a great interest in Dublin City and I am sure would like to do something for it.  I am sure he would not like to do anything that would deter owners from going ahead with necessary improvement.  I ask him to consider the case of our housing schemes carried out by public utility societies, the houses being occupied mostly by young married couples, young men who are known as white collar workers.</P>
    <P>When a man in that position goes into a new house he has to make a deposit of £50, £100 and, in some cases, £200.  It represents perhaps his life's savings.  The balance of the money which he requires for the purchase of the house has to be borrowed at a high rate of interest.  If he goes to the bank he has to pay 6 per cent. for it, whereas the charge a couple of years ago was 4 per cent. and 4½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving an <Col N="2195" /> example of what happens to that man in the way of having his costs increased. His house is no different from any other terrace house in the locality.  It is just a good, ordinary working-class house.  But what happens in his case is that the valuation commissioners go in and put a valuation of £21, £23 or £24 on that house, whereas the valuation for houses of the same kind in the locality is £18. £18 is the average valuation of that type of house in Dublin City.</P>
      <P>In Philipsburgh Avenue there was a new corporation house-purchase scheme.  Grants were made to the £10- a week worker who is able to look after himself.  The valuation of these houses is £21.  In the same neighbourhood the valuation of the same type of house is only £18.  It is only a difference of £3, but why add that £3 a year to the white-collar worker, the good clerical worker, the bus driver or mechanic?  Instead, he should be given the benefit of the doubt and the valuation should be reduced to £18 or £16 so as to give him an opportunity of paying his way, having regard to the fact that he has saved the municipality some money by building his own house instead of looking for a house under the Housing of the Working Classes Act which the Government is doing so much to put into operation.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House that it should unanimously press the Minister in respect of this matter, if he requires pressing.  Something tells me that he will not require much pressing.  I know his interest in Dublin.  I know his interest in the Rathmines area.  In the Rathmines area, above all other areas, good houses are going into decay for want of repairs, a new roof or a new wall.  I believe that something will be done, with the aid of my colleagues, to encourage the people to undertake these repairs.</P>
      <P>I join in the appeal that has been made and I would ask the Government to give some encouragement to people who have money to spend, at some risk, to add to their premises or to build new ones.</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of merit in the speeches <Col N="2196" /> we have heard so far in this debate, with one exception and the one exception, I regret to say, is the speech we have just listened to.  Deputy Alfred Byrne, I gather, is supporting this motion because it would give work now to a number of carpenters and bricklayers in the City of Dublin.  When I hear Deputy Alfred Byrne address himself to questions in this House with that sort of approach I cannot forbear recalling and reminding the House that there was a proposal initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1946 which would be coming to fruition just now and which would give employment to every man who is at present unemployed in the Dublin building trade, that was the Dublin Castle reconstruction scheme which was killed by our predecessors in 1948, which was killed unanimously and vehemently by every member of our predecessors in Government in 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to another argument, equally invalid and equally nonsensical.  There is something to be said for the investigation which Deputy Cogan asks the House to favour but the things that are to be said in favour of that motion are not the things which Deputy Alfred Byrne has said.  There are much more cogent arguments.  Deputy Cogan produced many of them himself.  Deputy Murphy produced some and I am sure when Deputy Cogan comes to wind up he will reinforce what he has already said in support of this motion.  But, I am referring to this weaker brother who has come to Deputy Cogan's rescue. I am referring to Deputy Alfred Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne has said, among other things, as justification for refraining from making any valuations upon any improvements, that he knows or has known of a man who bought expensive machinery, going into business under the protection of a tariff, laid that machinery down on expensive concrete foundations and yet will not take steps to put a weatherproof roof over the machinery.  Does anybody believe that such a man exists outside a mental hospital?  Does anybody believe that a man who bought expensive <Col N="2198" /> machinery in order to make profits, under the protection of the Government which is anxious to develop the industrial economy of this country, is going to allow that machinery to be subject to all the vicissitudes of weather simply because, if he happens to put a weatherproof roof over it his valuation may possibly be increased?  I do not know of any man who would be so foolish, and I am perfectly certain that the person to whom Deputy Alfred Byrne has referred is a mere chimera of his own imagination.</P>
    <P>The next misstatement which Deputy Alfred Byrne made was this: He said that if this person were to put a watertight roof over this expensive machinery which he had taken the trouble to put down on costly concrete foundations, the valuation commissioners would come in and up would go his valuation.  Deputy Alfred Byrne is a member of the Dublin Corporation of long standing.  I think he was for eight or nine years Lord Mayor of the city. He has been an alderman, certainly, for as long as I can remember.  Does not Deputy Alfred Byrne know that the valuation commissioner does not come in of his own initiative, that he is called in?  He is called in by the Dublin Corporation of which Deputy Alfred Byrne is a member, or perhaps he may be brought in by some fellow-ratepayer who feels that, because the new premises are undervalued, the general body of fellow-ratepayers are not being fairly treated.  Is not that how the commissioner of valuation comes in?  Is not that why the valuation goes up&mdash;because the Dublin Corporation, of which Deputy Byrne is such a shining light and for whose actions he is responsible with every other member of the corporation, requires the commisioner of valuation to make a revaluation of any premises which have undergone structural alteration?</P>

      <P>Do not ask me to be profane, because there are limits to the provocation which I can endure without retaliating in kind on Deputy O'Higgins.  I want to address myself to this motion because the time is very limited.  I want to come now to the case which was made for the motion and, if I am permitted by the courtesy of Deputy O'Higgins, to state my attitude in regard to the motion.</P>
      <P>The debate on this motion has served a very useful purpose in focussing attention on the many anomalies and inequities which have developed as a result of continuing to operate on a general valuation which was made almost 100 years ago.  So far as I am aware, no other State, at least no State which would claim to be well-ordered and progressive, raises virtually the whole of its local taxation and an appreciable part of its national taxation on a basis so anachronistic as our valuation in fact is.  With this obsolete method of valuation for deriving income from property we are bound to have inequalities of treatment and substantial inequities as between individual property owners and occupiers and the general body of their fellow-citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed this out when in 1938 I introduced a Bill in this House to provide for a general revaluation of the property of this country.  It was pointed out, however, very much earlier than that.  It was pointed out more than 50 years ago that the anomalies and inequalities which existed even at that time could not be remedied unless there were a general revaluation of property in this country. There was a commission set up to investigate the problems of local taxation in Ireland, and in 1902 the then commissioner of valuation gave it as his considered opinion that these evils, which are not, admittedly, so apparent or so widespread or so gross as they <Col N="2200" /> are now, could not be cured until we had a general revaluation of the country.</P>
    <P>When I brought in the Valuation Bill in 1938 I stated this in regard to the position as it existed then and as it exists to-day&mdash;I am quoting from Volume 74, columns 257 and 258 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a position which creates inequities not merely as between one ratepayer and another or one taxpayer and another, but as between whole classes of ratepayers, as between whole classes of taxpayers, as between direct taxpayers and indirect taxpayers, as between urban ratepayers and rural ratepayers, as between the wealthy municipalities and the rest of the country and as between the wealtier inhabitants of those municipalities and their less fortunate fellow citizens.  The present cadastre of valuation, in short, is an anachronism, an indefensible anachronism, which by reason of the injustices and anomalies that derive from it, is injurious to the credit of our public authorities, and tends to impede all social progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever other differences have emerged between me and those who have spoken in support of Deputy Cogan's motion, there is at any rate general agreement that the present valuation is an anachronism which by reason of the injustices and anomalies that derive from it, is injurious to the credit of our public authorities, and tends to impede all social progress. I went on to say later:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principle underlying rating is that in each area the cost of the local services should be divided among the ratepayers in proportion to the net annual value of the property occupied by them.  If there is to be an equitable distribution of the burden, the ratio of distribution should be a ratio of the values actually existing, and not a ratio of the values as they existed or would have existed in the last century or in 1913.  Now, not merely are the valuations in the present cadastre on the whole too low; but the relations which the valuations of the <Col N="2201" /> several hereditaments of which it is comprised bear to the true net rental values of the properties concerned are not, in fact, uniform and consistent with each other.  Accordingly the cadastre is bad from the point of view of relativity as well, which means that it is unsatisfactory for the purposes of local rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that extent I accept wholeheartedly what Deputy Cogan has stated in his motion, but I cannot go further. I cannot go to the extent that he would ask us to go, and that is to say that, pending the report of the commission which he would propose to set up, no increase should be made in the valuation of buildings because of improvements or extensions. I cannot do that for the simple reason that, in general, it may be stated that all valuation is based on improvements at least so far as buildings go.  For instance, when a house is erected on a virgin site it is an improvement and an extension, or when a tenement is pulled down and, say, a hotel is erected in its stead, that also is an improvement.  If it were decided that improvements of new buildings should not be valued at all, whether they were shops, cinemas, dwellings, hotels or similar structures, that they would bear no rates but would enjoy, while bearing no rates, all the public services, the House will realise that the ultimate result would be that the whole burden of maintaining local services would be shifted from the new and valuable property on to the old, decaying and deteriorating property and ultimately we should have a general collapse of the whole structure of valuation from which the income of local authorities is derived and we would have this old property becoming, because it was carrying an increasing burden of rates, more and more uneconomic.  In short, this old property and the district in which it was situated would soon be converted into a slum.</P>
    <P>Take some of the anomalies that would be created if that portion of Deputy Cogan's motion were to be accepted.  If we were to refrain from valuing improvements or extensions at their full value as rent-rendering property, <Col N="2202" /> a person could add a shop to a dwellinghouse, a restaurant to a service garage, a ballroom, a bedroom or a billiard-room to his residence and he would be called upon to pay nothing in respect of these extensions, some of which he might have carried out for his own comfort and convenience and others of which he might have carried out with a reasonable certainty in his own mind that he would derive a handsome profit from them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan in the course of his remarks referred to the fact that there was a certain distinction as between direct and indirect taxation.  He mentioned, among other things, that he was not in favour of making all taxation indirect in form and that he would have a fair balance as between direct and indirect.  Indirect taxation may be said to be a tax upon expenditure. Direct taxation may be said to be a tax upon income.  Rates combine in the one entity the two forms of taxation, indirect taxation upon expenditure and direct taxation upon a notional or assumed income which is derived or would be derivable in certain circumstances from property.  The rates are based upon the valuation in which again there is inherent this idea of income derivable from property because, if I can state it not in the great terms of the provisions in the Valuation Act but in a popular way, the valuation is required by law to be based on the rent which a willing tenant would pay to a willing landlord, the tenant paying the rent, rates, taxes and other outgoings necessary to maintain the property in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>That idea of rent which is derived, or, if the property were let, would be derived from it forms what I may describe as the income concept in this idea of rates.  Therefore, it constitutes what might be said to be the direct element of taxation in the payment. Similarly, it can be assumed that if a person is in such circumstances that he can occupy a property from which that rent might be derivable in certain circumstances or is in fact derived his income must be commensurate with the expenditure and the commitment which he undertakes in the form of rent.  In that way rating based upon <Col N="2203" /> valuation is a form of tax upon a notional income.  It is true that the person may be living beyond his means and may be occupying a house the rent of which is not commensurate with the income which he in fact enjoys.  If that is so he is guilty of extravagance and I do not see that there is any merit in allowing a person who is inhabiting a house, the rent of which is more than he can reasonably afford or be expected to pay, to go free.  The best thing to do with him is to tax him according to what the income derivable from the property might properly be assumed to be and compel him to look for a cheaper house.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if a man is occupying a business premises the rates upon which are greater than the profits which he derives from his occupation of the premises, there is no merit and there is no advantage in permitting him to continue in his occupation of these premises because, if one does that, the man concerned will speedily find himself faced with insolvency.</P>
    <P>There are many points which I would like to deal with on this motion.  There are one or two matters that I should refer to because they relate more to the administrative side of the Valuation Office than to the general principles underlying this motion.  Deputy M.P. Murphy made a very cogent speech.  It was a very valuable speech and a well-informed contribution to the debate.  I am only sorry that Deputy Murphy was not here to make that speech in the year 1938 when his colleagues in the Labour Party were fighting the Valuation Bill of that year tooth and nail.</P>

      <P>In that event I will not deal with the submissions made by Deputy Murphy to-night.  I will reserve them until the Estimate for the Valuation Office comes before the House, when I will take the opportunity of dealing with them and will content myself with stating my view in regard to this motion.  As I have indicated, the Fianna Fáil Party were convinced long ago that a revaluation of the country was indispensable to the future orderly progress of our people. We held in 1938 that such a revaluation would lay the foundation for a new, efficient and a progressive system of local government here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would welcome, if we thought the House was in favour of it, the opportunity of reintroducing the Valuation <Col N="2205" /> Bill of 1938 and of making it law.  We would welcome it but, as we have already seen here to-night from Deputy Alfred Byrne, he is like the Labour Party in that he battens upon public disaffection and public discontent.  He does not want to have these things remedied.  He wants to have these things remain so that he may stand up and complain and growl about them in this House.  Consequently, I am afraid in present circumstances and in the present Dáil it might not be possible to put through a Revaluation Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already explained why we cannot suspend valuing improvements and extensions, but I would undertake to bring to the notice of the Minister for Local Government, who is the Minister primarily concerned with rating, the speeches which have been made in the House in support of Deputy Cogan's motion, and I feel that, as soon as circumstances permit, it might be possible for the Minister for Local Government&mdash;I must allow him to speak for himself&mdash;to ask the House to set up a commission or a committee to inquire into the various anomalies, the various inequities, and the various defects of our present rating system, particularly those which arise from our out-of-date valuations, and to suggest what changes might be made in the existing law on the assumption, however, that rates were in future to be levied upon equitable and up-to-date valuations.  I would hope that, perhaps, having gone to that extent to meet Deputy Cogan he would accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has indicated that he is favourable to the main proposal of this motion, to set up an investigation into this whole question of rateable valuations.  I stated at the very outset, when introducing this motion, that I did not regard it as a simple question or one that was of easy solution.  I indicated that, like all other questions involving contributions which the citizen must make in the way of taxation, it is very complex and any alteration or change in the basis of the system must be very carefully considered from every angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties which the <Col N="2206" /> Minister has indicated in regard to any stay on the operations of the valuation commissioners.  In introducing the motion, I did not suggest that such a stay should be of a permanent nature. I realise that in a matter of this kind one has to await the decision of the commission of inquiry.  All I asked was there might be a stay pending the result of that commission's investigation. I would like to suggest that the commission be set up at an early date and that its report be forthcoming as soon as possible so that this whole question might be solved in an equitable way.  I realise that to put any stay on the operations of the valuation commissioners would involve legislation and I feel that if we are to have legislation at all we might as well have comprehensive legislation recommended by a commission designed to solve this problem in the interests of the community generally.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that a general revaluation is the only thing that is required.  I do not subscribe to the view that a general revaluation, if it comes about, should imply or carry with it a general increase in valuations. The total valuation of this State is in or around £12,000,000.  I would not favour any legislation which would tend to increase that total valuation.  I am in favour, however, of legislation which would tend to put valuations on a fair and equitable basis and which would have the effect of giving the proper incentive to work of development and improvement of existing property.</P>
    <P>I know that this whole question of valuations is one about which there has been a great deal of controversy and about which many suggestions have been put forward.  I remember reading the views of Henry George on this question in which he suggested there should be no valuation whatever upon property created by the community but that the valuation should be placed entirely upon the building sites.  I can see the great merit in that suggestion but I can also see very many difficulties in putting it into operation.  It is because I realise not only the advantages of having this whole question ironed out but also because I see the <Col N="2207" /> difficulties that lie ahead, that I have suggested that the matter should be fairly and thoroughly investigated.  It is for that purpose that I tabled this motion and I hope this investigation will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I would like to underline some points which were made in support of the motion by some of the speakers.  I would like particularly to underline the very useful point made by Deputy Dockrell.  I must say Deputy Dockrell spoke in favour of the motion although he had been forbidden by his Party Whip to second it.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with Deputy Sweetman.  There are in every army some misguided sergeant majors who never know where their troops are located or in what direction they are firing.  That happened to Deputy Sweetman on several occasions last week.  Deputy Dockrell said&mdash;and this is an important point which the Minister should consider&mdash;that it does not always happen when an owner of rateable property improves that property, <Col N="2208" /> that he does so in order to increase his income.  There are very many cases in which owners of rateable property improve the property from a community motive or a social motive, in order to make conditions better for their employees or, in the case of shopkeepers, in order to improve conditions for their customers.</P>
      <P>It often happens that improvements are carried out by farmers solely with a desire to make the country a little brighter than it is.  I think there is a very strong case for giving a remission of rates for a considerable period at any rate to these people.  That is one point that will have to be considered by this commission, that it is not always in order to increase his income that a property owner improves his property.  I think it is a good thing to see citizens anxious to improve the appearance of their property and to make the country generally brighter. I would ask that the commission be set up at the earliest possible moment and that instructions be given to it to bring in a report as early as possible consistent with the depth and complexity of this problem.</P>
      <P>If you have a properly constituted commission which can get down to its work quickly, I am certain that recommendations will be made upon which legislation, which will remove the anomalies and injustices that exist, can be based, and thus pave the way for a more equitable system of taxation, a system upon which the burden can be more equitably distributed over the entire community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want again to stress the point that if there is to be a revaluation of rateable property, it should not be based upon the assumption that it will lead to an increase in the individual valuations of each citizen or the total valuation of the State.  There are foundations upon which valuations can be fixed other than the rental, the annual income or the annual letting value.  I think that in Britain a system has been devised whereby valuations are based on a percentage of the actual market value.  There are many other systems which might be considered but the main object should be to ensure, first of all, that the burden is equitably <Col N="2209" /> distributed over all sections of the community and, secondly, to ensure that no deterrent is put on any individual citizen who wants to improve his property and to give employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the exercise of his functions as head of the Department of Industry and Commerce has failed to take effective action to prevent the cost of living rising to its present high level, and requests the Government to take immediate steps to deal with the matter in the public interest.</P>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for almost 12 months, so that it can hardly be said that one is not prepared to go ahead with it at this stage.  It is a motion for which one would not require much preparation. We read in the newspapers this week-end that the price of butter was increased from 3/10 to 4/2 per lb., while the Dáil was adjourned.  I should like to know if the Government has received any protest from the housewives' association against this uncalled-for and unnecessary increase in the price of butter.  I should also like to be informed whether the Minister received a communication from Mrs. O'Carroll, representing the housewives' association, asking him whether the Government had consulted any representative of the general public, of her organisation or of any organisation catering for child welfare or the general interests of the country, before agreeing to this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reason to believe that no person representing the general public was consulted and that it was an Order made by the Government themselves, without consulting the Dáil, that <Col N="2211" /> butter would be 4/2 per lb.  And this in spite of the fact that it is only a week ago since a Minister stated the imported butter which now costs 4/2 per lb. could be sold for a profit at 3/9 per lb.  I want to know from the Minister why the imported butter should now be 4/2 per lb. when the Minister stated it could be sold for a profit at 3/9 per lb.?  This is an imposition on the people.  Butter has gone off the tables in a good many of the homes of working-class families in Dublin.  It has gone off the table in the homes of the unemployed, those in receipt of unemployment benefits, those in receipt of national health benefits, those on domiciliary treatment benefits and those suffering from tuberculosis.  Substitutes are being used such as margarine.  I do not know how long that will last.  Other substitutes are being used in working-class homes, in the homes of the unemployed and in those homes where there are large families.</P>
    <P>The people, instead of buying butter and margarine, are purchasing dripping everywhere they possibly can.  They are using that as a substitute for butter.  They cannot afford butter at the present day.  Butter is gone beyond the purchasing power of a very large percentage of our population.  I only speak for Dublin.  I say that it is rather unfair that the organisations were not consulted.</P>
    <P>I will go further and say that meat has gone off the table in respect of more than half the population of this city, even for the one day a week&mdash; Sunday.  The price of meat has increased.  If 2d. or 3d per lb. is not put on the meat, it has gone up at least 1d. per lb.  There is another commodity that used to be bought.  I refer to cooked ham.  The price of cooked ham is gone beyond that at which even a reasonably well-paid family with a moderate rate of wages could purchase. There is no use saying we have not a rationing system nor is there any use saying that there is no need for ration books.  Foodstuffs and the necessaries of life are rationed since the people are unable to pay the price for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2212" /> Meat has gone off the tables and butter has gone off the tables within the last week or so.  It was stated here quite recently, in reply to a question&mdash; I forget who asked it&mdash;that the £ which was valued at 20/- and bought 20/- worth of goods in 1940 was to-day worth only 8/9.  That means that an income of £200 which a man or woman or a person in the government or municipal service received in 1940 is to-day equivalent to only £90 according to the experts and the economists. Every member of this House who has to keep a household knows how difficult it is to make the income go as far as he can because of the high prices demanded for goods and especially for foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>We earnestly appeal to the Minister to remedy the position.  I can make no suggestion and, as I have said before, I am not charged with the responsibility of making suggestions as to how it can be done.  It is up to the Minister and the Government who have economists and experts on the staffs of the Civil Service to help them to devise some ways and means by which the people can get a fair share of the food at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>We all know that those on domiciliary treatment benefits, those in receipt of national health benefits and those on home assistance are not getting sufficient to keep them in good health. I will go no further than to say that they are not given sufficient to keep them in good health and it is up to the Minister and the Government to find a remedy for that.</P>
    <P>Take our Army pensions for example. Take the case of the man who gave 25 years service in our National Army or that of the man who gave valuable service in the Old I.R.A.  When such persons got pensions the Government meant those pensions to purchase goods to the full value of the amount of the pension given in order to help those people to live.  If that pension amounted to £100 per year&mdash;and very, very few of them got that pension&mdash;it is now worth only £50.  Others got pensions of £20, £30, £40 and £50 per year while others got small sums of from £7 and £8 per year.  Old I.R.A. representatives at the Mansion House <Col N="2213" /> meeting issued a pamphlet in which they said that the vast majority of the Old I.R.A. have pensions under £25 per year.  Are we going to do anything to help them to buy even what it was thought the £25 could buy at the time the pension was given them?  These people have gone beyond the stage of being able to get employment in competition with younger men.  The country owes a lot to them and it should not forget them.  Those people are rapidly passing away.  They are in receipt of a miserable pension of less than £20 per year.</P>
    <P>What has happened in regard to the price of every article?  The price of the tin of boot polish for cleaning the boots and shoes of the children and the price of floor polish and tinned goods has increased.  The price of every article used in the working-class household has gone up somewhat even if it is only by ½d.  There is no reduction. There is to be a reduction in the price of an imported commodity&mdash;tea. It would be no compensation to the people to take more tea and less butter and less meat.</P>
    <P>From the health point of view I think that something ought to be done.  I again say that the unemployed are anxiously looking forward to the Government doing something for them to enable them to get sufficient food for themselves and their children.  The price of butter has increased.  There is an increase in the price of clothing and the price of woollen goods has gone up.  The price of everything you could think of has gone up within the last five years.  The present Government promised they would reduce taxation and would do something for those people.  They have done nothing.  I want to give the Minister another opportunity of devoting his time to making a personal attack on myself. That is his job&mdash;his joy is to mention the name Alfred Byrne in some disparaging way&mdash;and I let him have his job.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into this motion further.  The dance tax that was removed might have been put to some good use for the people.  £140,000 a year was given back to the dance hall proprietors on the same day that the <Col N="2214" /> House by a majority voted for the removal of the subsidies on bread.  I think it was most inconsistent.  The removal of the subsidy on foodstuffs is something that the Government empowered themselves to do.  When the last Budget was introduced the Minister tried to justify it.  I said at the time that it was the most vicious Budget I ever heard of in my 40 years of public life in this country.  I said it was the most vicious Budget ever introduced and I repeat that.  It was an imposition on our working-class people.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  He increased taxation, he increased the tax on the licensed trade.  He would not take advice at the time.  The ordinary revenue that was to come from the licensed trade has been reduced. The proprietors of those houses will have to pay a high rate of interest while they are doing any work or carrying out improvements.</P>
    <P>I remember that the Minister for Finance was very careful to inform every member of the House here who was a member of Dublin Corporation that they could have done something about the valuations.  At the same time as he was trying to put that over, he knew it was not true.  He knew that was the law made by himself or carried on or enforced by himself when he had power.  He had power to amend the law, to prevent inspectors going in on the word of people reporting their neighbours for putting up a shed or a kitchenette.  He told the authorities at the time that it was not necessary to enforce these regulations, but he says: &ldquo;Alfred Byrne was a member of the corporation that imposed these conditions.&rdquo; The corporation did not impose the conditions.  My colleagues on the corporation here know that it is done by the rate collector in accordance with instructions laid down under the Valuation Acts and the members of the corporation as such&mdash;aldermen and councillors&mdash;have nothing to do with giving instructions or even amending the valuations.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have been trying to show under this motion the number of things that have been and are being increased in price every day in the week&mdash;bootwear, clothing, foodstuffs. The Government should do something about it and do it quickly. I have no remedy for it.  Recently I visited a very large number of working-class houses, some moderate, some good and some of the very lowest-paid workers in the city.  Everywhere we went in those districts showed us that there is not a house in Dublin to-day that has not a son or daughter or a husband unemployed and their income is reduced to meet the increased cost of living.  That is what I want to bring home to the Government, that every article that money can buy from the smallest tin of boot polish or floor polish and boot laces up to clothing has increased in price, with the exception of a few things.</P>

      <P>I am never sorry for anything I say in this House.  I try and put it across if I can, to the best of my ability.  I know that some members of the House look upon O'Connell Street as Dublin and they think that because O'Connell Street is brightened up and people are well dressed, Dublin City is prospering. Deputy Briscoe especially knows that, in the area he represents, every second house in the Ballyfermot district has one or two members unemployed.</P>

Every member of the House, I do not care what village or town he comes from, must have in his pockets at present imploring letters <Col N="2216" /> from constituents asking him to get employment for them.  If anyone wants to see what is going on in Dublin, let him go to Beresford Place on Friday morning next and see the men there. Let him see the women lined up in queues a quarter of a mile long, waiting to sign up.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about unemployment in this motion.  This has to deal with the Minister as head of the Department, failing to deal with the cost of living. That is the charge made against the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Deputy should confine himself to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have not the money to meet the high cost, with unemployment so bad at the North Wall, in the dockyard and the shipyard. People can see that for themselves. There is the evidence that unemployment means a reduced income into the house and less money to buy the bread, the butter, the tea, the sugar, and the other things that are necessary in a household.</P>
      <P>I cannot suggest a remedy for this state of affairs, I have no remedy for it myself.  I have not the experts and the economists that the Government has, to suggest remedies to give the people sufficient money, or something near sufficient money, to buy the necessaries of life in order to maintain their families in reasonable health and comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have drawn attention to the Victoria Street Labour Exchange, to the exchanges in Beresford Place.  Werburgh Street and elsewhere, as proof. I want my colleagues from country districts, in case there is any doubt as to what I am talking about, to go and see for themselves.  The cost of living has gone beyond all those people and they are suffering as a result of the high prices, the unemployment and the emigration.  People who cannot find <Col N="2217" /> money to get the necessary food at a fair price are emigrating.  That means keeping two homes.  When they go away they send home as much money as they can and then they have to pay for their lodging in whatever town they are fortunate enough to get employment in.</P>
    <P>Our shipyards cannot get steel, and, in the three months, October, November, and December, they lost £500,000 worth of shipbuilding because the steel was not there.  I do not think sufficient effort was made to get the steel for them or to provide the wages to enable the men to meet the grocers' bill.  If they do not get work and wages, they cannot buy foodstuffs.  The cost of living has gone beyond them and there is no other country in the world, to my knowledge, which has to pay the prices for foodstuffs that we have to pay.  I earnestly ask the Minister and the Government to take the matter in hands without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It would appear to require very little effort on the proposer's or my part, or on the part of any person speaking in favour of the motion, to adduce cogent arguments to establish that the Dáil should pass the motion. Of all the examples of the negligence of the Government in handling the affairs of the State in the past 20 months, the most glaring example has been the very drastic rise in the cost of living which was occasioned by the change of Government in June, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how Deputies who are going to support the Government point of view will speak in order to defend what has happened.  There was some sort of facile statement made before Christmas by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that, whereas the cost of living had gone up, a fact which he very much regretted, he hoped that wages would similarly have increased and that the situation would be stabilised. Any person who has any experience, as all Dublin Deputies certainly have, of the sufferings of the people in this city knows that the cost of living has gone well beyond the incomes of the people and that they are now suffering great and unnecessary hardships <Col N="2218" /> as a result of the Government's deliberate policy of increasing costs, a policy which was enshrined in the Budget last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has given an example of some of the effects of which he is only too well aware.  The Minister and all Deputies must know the situation very well indeed without any stressing of it on my part.  The fact that the cost of living has gone up by 12 per cent. since June of 1951 has meant that many people are now living on a reduced standard of living.  Some persons, it is true, some lucky persons, have had their incomes adjusted to meet the rise in costs, but they are in a minority, and we have in the City of Dublin and throughout the country housewives doing on a lesser wage-packet than heretofore.  We have old age pensioners trying to live on a lesser pension, in real terms, than they had before the change of Government, and we have retired civil servants and other pensioners and persons living on fixed incomes who have had no opportunity of getting an increase in their incomes also suffering greatly from what has occurred in the past 20 months.</P>
    <P>These are but some of the groups who are now suffering from the rise in living costs which has occurred since June, 1951, and, I repeat, it is facile to say that the position has stabilised itself and that incomes have mounted up to reach the level which the cost of living has now reached.  I do not know whether that argument will be adduced by those Independent members of the House who may be wishing to support the Government and justify themselves before their constituents, or by Government speakers who wish to justify what has happened in the past 20 months.</P>
    <P>Another argument has been adduced in order to try to turn aside blame from the Government.  It has been suggested more than once that it was post-Korean inflation, rising import prices&mdash;factors outside the control of the present Government&mdash;that were responsible for the increased costs over the past 20 months.  There is no truth in that statement that rising import prices and external factors such as <Col N="2219" /> world prices affected the rise in the cost of living.  I should like to make a quotation from the Dáil Reports, Volume 135, No. 5 of December 4th last, where, in the course of a speech, the following statement was made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is true to say that only internal factors are causing prices to go up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is interesting to know who made that statement.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; is December the 4th of last year.  It was only a few months after the Budget had been brought in&mdash;a Budget which increased the cost of living by no less than 11 points.  It was quite true to say that in December of last year it was not external factors which had caused the increase in the cost of living but internal factors brought about by deliberate Government policy.  The index figure for import prices clearly indicates that the rise in import prices, which I have no doubt did impose a tremendous strain on the cost of living, had by the time the present Government came into power started to <Col N="2220" /> flatten out.  I should like to recall for Deputies that the index figure for the cost of living in May, 1948, stood at 100 and that over two and a half years later it stood at 102.  In November, 1952, that was the cost-of-living index figure.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the tremendous attack made by the Fianna Fáil Party, then in opposition, on the then Government for the alleged increase in the cost of living when the cost of living had increased, no doubt, by two points over that period of two and a half years.  I come now to May, 1951. The cost of living had gone up to 109. I do not know what satisfaction the Minister and his colleagues derive from the fact that the cost of living had gone up.  The members of the then Government had said that the rise in import costs, post-Korean inflation, were going inevitably to cause a rise in the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to give the figures of import prices, if the Minister will listen.  The index number for import prices is taken at 100 in 1938.  In January, 1949, less than a year after the inter-Party Government had come into power, the import price index stood at 228.1.  In June, 1951, it had gone up to 303.4, an increase of 75.3 points.  There had been an increase of 75 points in the import prices index figure, and during that <Col N="2221" /> time the cost-of-living index figure had gone up by only nine points.  As I said, there was a change of Government in June, 1951, and import prices continued to increase for a short period.  They then flattened out and, by June of last year, they had <Col N="2222" /> returned to the figure they were at in May, 1951.</P>
