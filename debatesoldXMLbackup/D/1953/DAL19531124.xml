      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has only to take a drive round the coastline of the South and West of Ireland to see a great number of foreign trawlers at various times of the year well within the three-mile limit. I put down the question to see if the Minister could give us any information as to whether he contemplates a helicopter service or some use of the Air Corps for the purpose of inter-communication between these and the patrol vessels for the purpose of catching <Col N="624" /> these people. The manner in which information is now transmitted makes it almost impossible to convey information in such a way that it can be acted upon in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinion of the experts who examined this question is that the present system is far superior to any system which could be carried out as a result of the use of the air service. As the Deputy may know, the present system is that if there is deemed to be anything in the nature of poaching within the three-mile limit&mdash; there is tremendous difficulty in deciding whether these vessels are within the limit or not&mdash;the Garda are almost in direct communication with a unit who can inform the headquarters and as a result of wireless communication, if a vessel of ours is nearby, direct communication with the vessel is immediately made and steps taken to deal with the matter. To date, there have been 17 or more arrests made by that method. I am satisfied that we are not getting any serious complaints from the Garda now and seamen and other people are watching these vessels very closely.</P>

    <P>As I have already stated in reply to an earlier question on this subject the continuance in operation of the rule requiring women national teachers to retire on marriage is a matter of general policy involving considerations of a social and economic as well as of an educational nature.

      <P>If the Minister is considering this matter, would he bear in mind the serious danger that would arise to working-class tenants as a whole if there was no restriction on the sale of labourers' cottages, the danger that these cottages would be bought by the better-off classes and that we would thereby get back to that most detestable evil of the tied house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can remember, that was the reason for the insertion of the prohibition, and that reason is as strong to-day, if not stronger, than it was then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the prohibition on use after sale. What I am asking the Minister is to consider favourably the right of a tenant, if he wishes, to purchase his cottage outright now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, a tenant under a scheme that I know of, anyway&mdash;I do not know whether there is the same scheme throughout the country or not&mdash;is entitled to purchase outright over a period of years, paying the purchase price by a terminable annuity, and eventually becoming the owner, but subject to the prohibition mentioned by Deputy Norton. Now, leaving that prohibition aside for the moment, would the Minister consider the introduction of legislation entitling a tenant, if he wants to, to purchase outright now without having to pay <Col N="633" /> the purchase price over a period of years&mdash;or in other words, to redeem it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that at present there is no question of amending the law, and that no consideration has been given to that proposition; but even if there was, I can only say this: that I would be more than hesitant before amending the law in any fashion that would result in the alienation of these houses which were provided for a certain class.</P>

      <P>The grant for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act already notified to the Kildare County Council is the maximum amount which can be made available and cannot be increased. Should a situation such as is envisaged in the questions arise, consideration of the allocation of grants for the provision of employment in the area would be a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that some hundreds of local workers have been laid off on these particular schemes, that a further layoff is threatened, and that this is happening within four or five weeks of Christmas? In view of that, is it not obviously desirable from every standpoint that some employment of a constructive and useful character should be provided without having these people traipsing to the labour exchange between now and Christmas, a time when most workers find that even their normal wages are insufficient for them to meet the needs of that particular season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

The board states that the full number of men required for current operations and for preparatory work for the next production season is being retained, and that <Col N="647" /> recruitment of additional workers for seasonal operations will be resumed at the end of February next.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Bord na Móna told Deputy Sweetman and myself that this year they proposed to retain on Timahoe bog 90 local workers, as compared with 250 last year? The remainder will be disemployed four weeks before Christmas. Does the Minister regard that as a triumph of organisation by a State sponsored body like Bord na Móna, which has so organised its work that hundreds of workers will be thrown out of employment with no alternative but to go to the labour exchange on the eve of Christmas? Surely Bord na Móna should recognise that they have a social and moral obligation to the people employed by them and that obligation should extend to providing employment for these people at least over the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>I made notes at the discussion with Bord na Móna: they said they would retain in their employment 140 workers but approximately 50 of that 140 are not local workers. They are folk who have moved into some of the houses built by Bord na Móna in that area and they are displacing the local workers. The board told us, and they did not put a tooth in it, that they propose to lay off 120 workers in the Rathangan area in a matter of a couple of weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the figures given to us were: last year 357 workers were employed on the Timahoe group; this year there will be 140; that represents a reduction of 140 and 140 was, without question, the figure given to us? In addition the figure of 217 was specifically mentioned. Of the 140 approximately 50 will not be local people, so that only 90 will represent local people <Col N="649" /> and there will be in consequence about 160 local people who got employment in that area last year who will not get employment in that area this year. Surely it should be possible, remembering that this is being done by Bord na Móna on the eve of Christmas, for the Government to make some arrangements, if not through Bord na Móna thróugh the Local Authorities (Works) Act, or otherwise, to provide employment for these workers at any rate up to Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any such statement and nothing I have said is capable of such a construction. It is nothing short of a scandal that a State organisation like Bord na Móna should lay off large numbers of workers a few weeks before Christmas. They should be able to organise their services in such a way as to keep these workers in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a seasonal operation. When I first came here with the proposition to develop these bogs <Col N="650" /> to produce fuel for power stations, I got that proposition through despite the Opposition, and my estimate then was that 50 per cent. of the employment would be seasonal and 50 per cent. would be permanent. There is no possibility of organising this type of production except on a seasonal basis. This work is dependent upon the weather. With increasing mechanisation, the seasonal element will tend to diminish in importance and that will be because fewer men will be required at the peak seasons of the year whereas the number retained all the year round will tend to rise. There is no means by which the seasonal nature of disemployment can be minimised. It is no more immoral and unjust for Bord na Móna to lay off men at the end of the production season than it is for the sugar company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that quite apart from the numbers being laid off, another 437 men were laid off for seasonal reasons? The dismissals to which Deputy Norton and I are referring are not the seasonal figures. The Minister talks about 50 per cent.; not even 20 per cent. is being retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have tried to explain already, at a certain period in the development of each bog, when capital development works are in progress, the workers who would otherwise be employed on production works are employed on capital development works. When capital development works are over, there is no employment for them. Bord na Móna will employ every man for whom they have work. Everybody can rest easy in their minds as to that. The only reason why men are being laid off is because there is no work for them. That is not a problem for Bord na Móna.</P>

No appreciable reduction in employment is anticipated at other bog works where development operations are still in progress. The board is retaining the maximum number of men required for current operations and for work in preparation for next production season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> With regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, the board's operations are largely seasonal in character, although with increasing mechanisation it is expected that, in the course of time, seasonal fluctuations in employment will tend to diminish.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for determining the manner in which the exploratory works at Avoca should be conducted rests with Mianraí Teoranta who have the benefit of the advice of expert consultants. The company have informed me that these consultants have advised that the underground work at West Avoca is approaching the point at which all the information which can usefully be obtained by tunnelling and underground drilling will have been obtained, and that further information required about the extent of the deposits including those at East Avoca can best be obtained by diamond drilling from the surface. It is too soon to say with certainty when redundancy may arise or how many men may be involved. It is the company's intention to retain in employment the maximum possible number of men experienced in mining work, so as to have a skilled labour force available for employment on the commercial working of the mine, should such working prove feasible following the completion of the present exploration scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate last week, I hoped to <Col N="660" /> draw special attention to the very important question of the Local Authorities (Works) Act. I believe that it is correct to say that the present Minister for Local Government has at least been consistent in one very important point. He has been consistent up to the hilt in his deadly political opposition to the Local Authorities (Works) Act. We realise that when this important measure was introduced in this House, opposition was expressed not alone by the present Minister but by some of his colleagues who are also now on the Government front benches. At that time, when in opposition, they made it perfectly clear how much they were opposed to this measure, and since coming into Government they have brought that bitterness much further in so far as this very important measure, for which £1,750,000 was provided in the 1951 period, has now dwindled down in this Estimate before us to about £400,000. Perhaps the Minister may go so far as to say that it was reduced one year during the operation of the inter-Party Government. That is correct. We realise that, but we also realise that in the first year the most important work, perhaps, was put in operation. After that, perhaps, the scheme, or the number of schemes, may have been progressing at a somewhat slower rate; but certainly they were progressing in a determined fashion which we can say quite clearly here would undoubtedly mean a continuation of an Estimate of at least over £1,000,000 a year. Now we are faced with the problem because of the opposition of a Minister who at the outset here last year took advantage of his position to say that engineers employed by local authorities carried out work in a disgraceful manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He quoted for the benefit of the House in defence of his own decision to reduce this important Estimate certain instances which apparently had occurred in a local authority of which he had been a member. Let me say at this stage that it would have been much more appropriate for the present Minister, and much more courageous perhaps for him, instead of coming in here to this House when dealing with the Estimate last year, to have spent his time in using the words about it <Col N="661" /> in the county council of which he is apparently a member. I say here openly, as other members in opposition in this Chamber have already said in areas that we represent, that we can say that this money has been very well spent in the schemes that were put in operation. Likewise may I say that if we had occasion to draw attention to some schemes that may not have been completed in the fashion that we would wish, we realise that it was our bounden duty as members of a local authority to mention these matters in the local authority and not to use Dáil Éireann to do so.</P>
    <P>I consider, of course, that the defence put up by the Minister for such action in connection with this very important matter is a defence which has no justification or foundation. In passing, let me say that while the Minister and many of his colleagues opposed this very important measure at the outset, I am quite prepared to give credit to members of the Government Party who, at that time, when in opposition, stood up in this Chamber and expressed the view that they were very much in favour of the introduction of this scheme and of putting it into operation. At least those members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government Party at the present time, did appreciate, and I know they still appreciate, the importance of work carried out under that scheme. It is now left to us, because the Minister for Local Government was backed by the Minister for Finance, who himself opposed this scheme, to have the experience of knowing that from June to June, 12 months, no fewer than about 22,000 men left the land in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister understand this much&mdash;that a large percentage of these men were people who were depending on work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act because while employed casually at springtime or at the harvest by farmers, unfortunately, in most instances, it was a case of unemployment during the winter periods. Thanks be to God the inter-Party Government and the Minister for Local Government, a Labour member, at that time realised their due responsibility in these matters. I say here openly to the Minister <Col N="662" /> himself that while this important Estimate, vitally important to the people of rural Ireland, was being discaused last year he summed it up in a few words when he said that there was nothing of importance raised during the whole debate. I know now that this Minister is quite prepared to leave this Chamber having ignored the remarks and views of everyone, but let me tell the Minister this much, that the fact that there has been a huge reduction in the amount of money for the Local Authorities (Works) Act in this year means that the Minister has been quite prepared to accept the fact that through his willing co-operation men have unfortunately had to leave rural Ireland owing to unemployment in these areas.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters to which I wish to refer in connection with the housing problem in general as I did not discuss them the last evening. My colleague from West Cork drew particular attention to one important question, and that is the question of utilising slates for the roofing of houses under local authorities. The Minister may tell us that it is a matter for the local authorities. He may tell us that it can be achieved partly through the operation of specifications for the local authorities and through their decision as to whether they will accept tenders for roofs or for houses that may be roofed with tiles. Again I believe that we may perhaps be told that we have a parochial outlook, yet we realise ourselves that in many areas of County Cork&mdash;in West Cork and in parts of South Cork, such as the small area like Courtmacsherry and those districts&mdash;there are unfortunately a number of people unemployed where there is, truthfully speaking, a plentiful supply of natural slates. I think it is deplorable that local authorities are consistently every year going in more for the use of tiles in the re-roofing of houses. While local authority houses look very neat and tidy with tiled roofs, we know that after a short number of years the colours run. The result is that you have nothing but a common-looking bit of cement plaster on the top.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his advisers should <Col N="663" /> strongly impress on local authorities the necessity for using slate roofing where possible. Where tenders are submitted for sanction, I would suggest that consideration be given to those who tender for Irish slates unless there is a big discrepancy between the prices submitted by contractors.</P>
    <P>Local authority rents and such matters were mentioned in the course of the debate. All I have to add in this connection is that I always wondered, irrespective of what Government was in office, why the repayment period in respect of local authority loans is so short. That is one of the most important problems we have to face when we discuss rents with the county manager or assistant county manager. It would undoubtedly be of great advantage if the Minister gave us some idea as to why the loan repayment period is as it is. Some of the houses which were built 50 or 60 years ago are at the present time in an excellent state of repair. I am speaking of houses in general. I believe it would be of great advantage to local authorities if we could succeed in getting the period of the repayment of the loan extended.</P>
    <P>There is also one other small matter I should like to mention in connection with housing. The position at the present time is that when a local authority prepare and publish a compulsory purchase order apparently a period of five weeks or so must elapse after publication in the local papers before that compulsory purchase order is submitted to the Government or to the Minister for general sanction. I have in mind schemes in respect of which the land was got by voluntary agreement with the owner. That being the case, there is a tendency to delay the building of houses which is caused through regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, we have had very many delays in regard to acquiring sites in our county. I am proud to be able to bring my mind back to one very important thing which was done by the Minister for Local Government during the years 1948, 1949 and 1950. It is true that he was condemned by some people who were, perhaps, narrow-minded in their outlook, but one of the greatest boons conferred on us in our area was the appointment by the then Minister for Local Government of a county housing superintendent. I believe it is only fair to say that the schemes since submitted by the South Cork County Board of Health, through the county council, show the hand of that county housing superintendent. The co-operation of landowners was secured. Through the advice of the county housing superintendent we have been helped to go along with these very important projects. Should this not be in operation in other counties, I would suggest the appointment of such an official in those counties. It would prove fruitful as it has done in Cork.</P>
      <P>One very big problem in rural areas &mdash;it applies also to large towns&mdash; concerns the question of local authority rents. I should like to know what is the present attitude of the Department and the Minister towards the problem of the rents being paid by tenants of local authority houses in rural areas. The present chairman of the South Cork Board of Health area, who is a colleague of the Minister, has at all times, in company with the other members of that board, made it perfectly clear that our anxiety is to see people living in decent conditions. Under the scheme which we got put into operation in the 1948 period we did not go so far, nor did the county manager go so far, as to question the prospective tenants as to what they could pay before the houses were completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always understood that it was the duty of the county medical officer of health to inspect the homes of would-be applicants to see if their homes <Col N="665" /> were in a bad condition or were condemned. If they were in a bad condition or condemned, I understood that his duty then was to report that these people were deserving of new houses. I got to understand that the assistant county manager appointed tenants on the recommendation of the county medical officer on that basis. I should like to ask the Minister if it is correct that for the past 12 months or so the first question people were asked whose houses were inspected and who applied for county council cottages was whether they could pay a specific rent.</P>
    <P>I maintain that our duty under the Housing Acts is, first and foremost, to house the people who are living in condemned houses. I know&mdash;and I am sure members of the same local authority know&mdash;people who were asked whether they could pay the prescribed rent. Those people were so circumstanced that they were unable to promise to pay that rent. I have been told that that is in operation due to a circular from the Department of Local Government. Should it be that such a circular is sent from the Custom House in Dublin to a local authority, I maintain it is unfair and unjust. In rural Ireland, at any rate, people must come before money. If through no fault of their own these people find that they cannot pay certain high rents, then I say that it is our duty, if we believe in a true Christian way of life, to help them. When I make that suggestion let me remind the Minister that in this House, when in opposition, of course, a colleague of the Minister used words to that effect. At column 683 of the Official Debates of 5th July, 1950, a prominent member of the present Government stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...It is essential that the rents of houses built by public authorities with Government subsidies and with subventions from the rates, should be related to the capacity of the tenants to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The member who said that happens now to be Minister for Finance, and if in 1950 this problem should be related to the capacity of the tenant to pay, <Col N="666" /> circumstances have not altered between 1950 and 1953. I am anxious to know whether this new departure which tends to victimise certain honest people in rural areas has been put into operation through the local authority manager or, if not, was it the result of instruction or circular from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some interesting figures on the question of housing, the number of houses built and also the number under construction. Dealing with last year's Estimate, the present Minister, at column 342 of the Official Debates of 8th July, 1952, informed the House that at the end of May, 1952, 9,323 local authority houses were in the course of construction and that 3,145 were in preliminary contract stages. Naturally enough, when we got those figures, informing us that there were well over 9,000 houses in the course of construction at the end of May, we were most hopeful that a figure reaching to that mark would be achieved by the end of the financial year, that is, between May and March. Yet, when giving the figures on this Estimate, the Minister stated that for the financial year 1952-53, there were 7,476 local authority houses completed. Therefore, as against the figure submitted of the number of houses in the course of construction in May, we find a discrepancy of 1,847 houses. Of course, the Minister may tell us that the words &ldquo;in the course of construction&rdquo; mean&mdash;according to local authorities and according to the Custom House&mdash;that tenders have been accepted and that it is a matter for the contractor to start building. I believe it is vitally important to give to our people in plain language figures which will be correct from every angle. Either the Minister was wrong in the figures he gave in May, 1952, when he said there were 9,323 houses under construction or he should explain why that number was not completed by the end of the following March. The Minister went much further to justify his claims as to the wonderful work he was doing when he informed this House and the people that there were also 3,145 houses in preliminary contract stages, and there is certainly <Col N="667" /> something wrong that there should be such a drop in the figures at the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it perfectly clear to the members of the House that his target has been and will continue to be 7,000 houses per year. That number will not be sufficient and must be increased. It can be increased and if we want to see people in decent homes the sooner we increase it the better. We have the men to do the work and, according to the Minister, we have the money. That being so, there is no reason why we should not be able to reach a higher figure and thus accommodate the homeless people at present seeking houses.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to stress the importance of co-operation between the local authorities, the Minister for Local Government and the Custom House itself; in referring to local authorities I naturally include county managers. I have no intention at this stage of entering into any discussion that might seem like a reference to impending legislation in connection with county managers but we in rural areas, especially those who are members of local authorities, believe that we could perhaps get much more co-operation from county managers were it not for the existence of that famous or infamous County Managers' Association. I am proud to say, however, that the county manager of Cork is not a member of such an association. When the Minister is dealing with local authorities his first obligation must be to those who are sent in as representatives because the people want those members to represent them. The sooner the Minister realises the importance of discussing local authority matters with members the better it will be for the people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the fact that unfortunately the present Minister for Local Government is quite prepared to show utter contempt for suggestions made in this House. That being the case may I say he has a long road to travel in order to realise the importance of his high office as Minister for Local Government in relation to rural areas? I will say for him that my own information <Col N="668" /> was that as member of a local authority he was respected as such; he was looked on by members and the staff as one who was prepared to help. I am sorry to say that his outlook and his attitude in general as regards this Estimate amount to nothing more than it did last year. He has taken no interest and will take no interest in any form of constructive suggestions or criticisms that we may offer here because we do not happen to be on his side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years local government has become so widespread in its impact on everybody that one has to look at it to-day in the concept of a subsidiary money raising body to the central Exchequer. The first problem one has to face and that the Minister must face is the extraordinary impact of the incidence of increased rates on a very large group of people. There has been a motion standing in my name here for a considerable length of time on the Private Members' List, dealing with the manner in which the Minister might be able to alleviate the distress that can be caused by the present method of rate collection. Taking a cross-section of view, whether it be from the local judiciary who have to enforce a certain type of writ and order at the behest of the local authority, or whether it be from people of reasonable substance who have to meet the present impact of rates, there is a constant worry and a constant menace there to the normal economy as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have come to the stage when we must ask ourselves how far, if successfully at all, there has been a segregation of responsibility as between the central Executive and the local authority. My own feeling has always been that there has not been a clear enough line of demarcation between the duties of both sections. That involves, to my mind, a tremendous expenditure on liaison staff and on the duplication of functions of the Department and the local authority. The incidence of increasing rates is closely bound up with the ever-increasing administrative staffs in local authorities and Government Departments. People throughout the length <Col N="669" /> and breadth of Ireland&mdash;particularly those living on limited salaries&mdash;are feeling very severely the impact of increased rates and of various other types of increased local charges.</P>
    <P>We have heard aired here the considerable grievance of people who are suffering the impetus of revaluation of their property. That may not be under the direct control of the Minister, I admit, but it is the subsequent charge that becomes payable to these people by way of rates that I want to get after. We find people to-day feeling the pinch. We know that is so, without our being gloomy. We have heard discussions, even during question time to-day, which indicate quite clearly that there is a rising incidence of unemployment and that for the first time in our history we are going to have severe unemployment virtually on the eve of Christmas.</P>
    <P>That situation arises in many instances from gross miscalculation or from inopportune planning&mdash;the responsibility for which I am going to place in the course of my argument to some extent on the many interminable delays one finds in the Department over which the present Minister presides. Whether or not it is a consequence of the managerial system, there has been in recent years an immense increase in the administrative costs of every local authority. There has been a very substantial increase in administrative cost in relation to the county council that operates in the area which I represent.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Desmond talks in his lucid way as a member of Cork County Council, he is talking in the full knowledge of the difficulties that are being experienced throughout Cork and particularly in West Cork&mdash;in some cases owing to the delays in the Department, and in other cases owing to the axe that the Minister has applied to works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act. It is small consolation to people who are groaning under the burden of rates that this inept attitude exists. It is no consolation to those who are feeling the impact of unemployment in rural areas throughout Ireland that the money should be available but is not available <Col N="670" /> to keep them in gainful employment doing work of national importance.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience we now have, I do not know how the Minister justifies the drastic reduction under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but I know this, as an incontrovertible fact, that were a reasonable sum of money in excess of the present allocation available under that Act we could certainly ameliorate the lot of thousands of people throughout the country and we could certainly ameliorate the lot of hundreds of people in areas like Berehaven, Kilcashin, Bantry, Kilcrohane and other lonely areas in the district I represent. If one considers the problem in its basic reality, one sees we have reached the stage where we must review&mdash;and it is the duty of the Minister to see that such a review is carried out&mdash;the functions of the local authorities as distinct from the functions of the Department. Having segrated those functions, the Minister must find some way of cutting the inordinate delays that exist, particularly in a large scheme of planning, between the move for the acquisition of a site and the ultimate commencement of the work. I do not want the Minister to think that I am going to be as unreasonable as to lay some of the interminable delays on title, and various investigations of title, at his door. The time has come for a comprehensive review of the difficulties that are created by the Department's not being able to swing into large schemes and to help the local authorities to swing into large schemes. Employment difficulties and hardships are being inflicted throughout the country by a lack of these schemes for immediate operation.</P>
    <P>Local government has become so widespread a problem that one must consider it in three different aspects. There is no doubt at all about it but that the increased cost of building and the increased cost of local authority housing have placed an incidence of rent on the backs of certain people that can be severe. There is no doubt at all about it but that the increase in rates throughout the country generally has created tremendous hardship in limited income groups. There <Col N="671" /> is no doubt at all but that the duplication of functions, resulting in interminable delays as between local authorities and the Department of Local Government, has led to considerable wastage of public money and considerable hold-up in progress.</P>
    <P>One sometimes wonders where the function of a local authority ends, or if it has any end, and where the function of the Department of Local Government begins. No matter what assurances we give in this House, or what answers we get to various parliamentary questions, there are ever-recurring delays in connection with all types of sanctions that must emanate from the Department of Local Government, whether these sanctions be merely simple matters in relation to housing grants to which people are entitled or whether they be in connection with sites or plans for bigger developments. It is time the question was asked bluntly: What is the cause of it all? It is also time the question was asked bluntly: What is going to be done to try to curb the spiral of ever-increasing costs in local administration?</P>
    <P>The Minister has considerable functions in relation to what has become one of the most substantial sources of employment by local authorities, that is, road maintenance and road development. Nobody is more anxious than I am to see adequate wages and good conditions given to road workers. I think, however, there is need for severe investigation of the rate of progress and the type of work that is being done on road maintenance generally. I wonder whether some new method of control of road maintenance and some progressive policy for dealing rotationally with main roads might not be more effective. I wonder if the provision of plant, machinery and various other types of equipment necessary for road maintenance might not be better if carried out by a central authority on a planned basis rather than have&mdash;as we have experienced&mdash;parts of roads repaired at one period and then, after a long period, the completion of work on other parts of the road.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for <Col N="672" /> increased rates is the increased cost of road maintenance, through county councils. We have had the impact of the increased cost of the maintenance of certain types of institutions which are maintained, or contributed to in their maintenance, by the local authority. The Minister nonchalantly disregarded the impact that the removal of certain food subsidies would have on those institutions and its ultimate reflection in increased rates. A dual personality seems to be arising in the central Department of Local Government and the local department as well&mdash;all adding up, as I have described it, to the incidence of administrative costs. It is doubtful whether all this duplication is necessary.</P>
    <P>I wonder if anybody can rationally justify, let us say, the employment of dual sets of highly technical professionally qualified people in both Departments. Investigations of site, examinations of plan, and so forth, are carried out by highly skilled and competent people in the local authority. That work is carried out by persons of high architectural or engineering standing and then it is sent forward again for review and re-examination by another bunch of architects or engineers. The matter goes backwards and forwards between the various sets of equally qualified persons and very often all that are involved are minor and non-consequential issues. Is all this duality of purpose necessary? Does the Minister or his Department ever consider the possibility of reducing this particular type of duality?</P>
    <P>We have had discussions from time to time in this House on the inordinate surcharge on many schemes created by virtue of engineers' and architects' fees. To me, it seems rather futile when one considers the immense duality of functions of people of professional, engineering and architectural standing advising the local authority and people who are attached to the Department of Local Government. I wonder whether many of the functions carried out by both authorities could not be merged in a practical and a more efficient way for the general improvement of the expedition, <Col N="673" /> if nothing else, of certain plans and projects.</P>
    <P>There seems to exist in the mind of the Department of Local Government a necessity for a counter-departmental check, in a detailed administrative way as distinct from a general functionary way, involving, in my opinion, the creation of an immense amount of administrative work that leads to further delays and further complications in getting the job done. It is difficult, unless one wants to get down very much to the urban council or local county council area, to make any impression upon the problem. Whether it is a consequence of the development of the managerial system or not, the cost of local administration has been constantly and ever upward since the putting into effect of this system. Even though there may have been much criticism of certain activities under the old régime, it is as nothing compared with the ever-increasing amount of complaint by people generally against rising local authority costs.</P>
    <P>People feel now, rightly or wrongly, that they are suffering tax extortion by the central Exchequer, and, in addition, the blister of the increasing impact of local rates. We saw the Minister become the effective tool for the Minister for Finance when that Minister found that budgeting had become difficult and the raising of money a problem and had the Minister for Local Government introduce his amendment of certain provisions relating to motor taxation which allowed him to grab a further £800,000 to £1,000,000 from the people. The people are justifiably asking where all this is going to stop and what device will next be used to make the Department the instrument for the extraction of more money.</P>
    <P>That is where I get into difficulties of a serious nature with regard to this duality of purpose. The problem can be epitomised in this way: whether it is wiser to have rate collectors around the country collecting rates on a warrant, or whether it is more practical to have the collection of rates carried out by the central office in a central way. Whether the problem is capable of a ready solution or not, I do not know, <Col N="674" /> but it does indicate the difficulties that exist in the mind of the general public in relation to the functions of local authorities. There seems to be somebody in the central authority doing a whole lot of things and he seems to have some kind of counterpart in the local authority doing the same things. Glancing through the Estimate for the Department, the Minister will see the extraordinary amount of money devoted to what one might describe as purely administrative cost.</P>
    <P>This debate has been rather long-drawn-out, and I do not intend to dwell on many of the minor difficulties, but I want to say that under the Minister's administration there is one thing definite and incontrovertible: whether the Minister protests as vehemently as the Minister for Finance protests that there is no slowing up in housing, there is, in fact, a tremendous slowing up in housing and tremendous unemployment arising in the building trade. I do not care whether the Minister says, or tries to say, that there is no slowing up in local authority housing. The fact remains that, with increased interest charges in relation to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, there is a decided falling-off in that type of building, and, on the figures of unemployment given repeatedly by the Central Statistics Office, it is quite obvious that, no matter what may be the reason, there is a substantial fall in the level of employment being given by housing and, in addition, there is the fact that the Minister by his axe in relation to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, has succeeded in creating substantial rural unemployment, particularly in the lacuna period which that Act was designed to counter. It may be that spite or any other motive, political or otherwise, inspires it, but there is no doubt that the reduction in the moneys allocated under that Act is creating difficulties and trouble in isolated rural areas, a solution of which the people in these areas can find only in the emigrant ship. Apparently, the Government have no real conception of the seriousness of that situation and no desire to arrest the haemorrhage.</P>
    <P>There are repeated and constant <Col N="675" /> warnings from all directions that people are groaning under the burden of rates and I feel that the Minister&mdash; possibly in anticipation of the discussion which I hope we will have before Christmas on the question of rate collection&mdash;should find some way of spreading the load over a period, either by way of monthly or even quarterly payments, so that it will not be felt as severely as it is being felt at present. Whatever has happened the last couple of years of this country's economic life have been difficult. I might say for political reasons that it is due to the dead hand of Fianna Fáil being back again on the helm of government. That may be a very large contributing factor but no matter how enthusiastic one may be or how blind one may be in his allegiance to a political Party, there is no doubt that money is infinitely scarcer to-day and people are infinitely more hard-pressed to meet their normal obligations than has been the case for a considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>That puts us in the fix that we must face up to the responsibility of finding the root cause of the constantly increasing burden and find a remedy for it. I say that a good deal of it can be alleviated by effective work by the machinery of the Department, which will have to start by getting a proper segregation of duties as between the local authority and its staff and the Department and its staff. There is no doubt at all in my mind that in that particular field of endeavour there is a very fruitful source of future saving for the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government may wash his hands in his own inimitable way of constructive criticism in this House but there is no doubt that in many parts of Ireland&mdash;and I would say in many parts of his own constituency&mdash;the substantial reduction in expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is being drastically reflected in rising rural unemployment. He will find I am sure in many parts of his constituency what I have found throughout my constituency&mdash;increased unemployment in the Christmas period, <Col N="676" /> with no effective contribution being made to alleviate the consequent distress. The Minister said nonchalantly to-day that he was going to ask the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works to do something about the problem in Kildare. It seems rather futile, indeed one might say rather charlatan-like, for a Minister who has deliberately slashed the amount of money available for the type of works best suited to meet the situation to ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to see if he could do something by way of a special scheme to alleviate distress. It is time that we got down to the job of endeavouring to do the best we can for the ordinary people of this country, as distinct from trying to adhere to Party viewpoints or to Party allegiance in matters of national distress. I say to the Minister that we will not in any way impede him if he wishes, for the purpose of meeting the present circumstances, to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to finance schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, to alleviate hardship generally over the period of the next couple of months. It is an unfortunate circumstance that we have to discuss the Estimate at this stage of the financial year with the pitiful knowledge that is at hand of the economic distress and unemployment that exist throughout widespread rural areas. As was remarked here to-day, at the best of times people have to stretch their resources in many cases, to deny themselves much in order to exist on the normal pay packet coming into many homes to-day and it is a poor tribute to this Dáil that we find that distress increased in many homes in rural Ireland by a tremendous increase in unemployment at the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>I said when speaking on the motion of confidence here some time ago that we were rapidly getting back in this country to the miserable outlook of the famine period when the only employment that could be found for our people was Government relief schemes. By implementing schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act we were getting away from the taint of the local relief scheme and, instead of that, we were starting to operate local <Col N="677" /> benefit schemes where the work was of such a nature as to ensure national progress in an overall plan and to ensure improvements of various kinds for local people whether by way of drainage of stopped rivers, the clearance of gully traps, the removal of surface water off roadways, or in improvements in the means of access to various rural properties. It was, in the general picture, of some national value, but to-day we had the Minister's sorry conception of dealing with a problem that might arise by wanting to transfer it to the Board of Works to see if they could do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the fault may not lie with the Minister. Indeed, I prefaced my remarks by saying that I do not think it does. It may be that, in the Shakespearian phrase, the fault lies &ldquo;not in his stars but in his times,&rdquo; but there is no doubt that the Irish people generally irrespective of political allegiance are becoming agitated about the increasing spiral of local taxation. The economic outlook of this Government does not seem to hold any hope of a cessation in that trend because each particular Act for which they are responsible in their tax extortion rampage puts the local authorities in the position that they have to try to meet the impact of this extortion by increases of all sorts in the remuneration of the various employees under their control. The time has come for somebody to tackle the unpleasant task of asking where it is all going to end. I do not wish to deny to the employee of any local body the right to get some compensation by way of increased wages to meet the impact of increased costs of tea, bread, sugar and other essentials for his home, but we have reached a stage under this Government, and under the present system of local administration, where we are adding to the central Exchequer extortion of taxes the subterfuge and camouflage of various types of local extortion. Whether they pass under the name of rates or taxes, increases in fees for driving licences, increases in motor taxation, increases in the cost of various ancillary commodities used in plant or transport, all amount to the same thing in that they <Col N="678" /> are a direct or indirect tax on the people of the country generally.</P>
    <P>It is time that the insistent demands of people were listened to and an investigation started as to what is the best method of controlling road maintenance throughout the country. We have a central road fund upon which the Minister was trenchant in his views, one over which he was going to sit like a bull terrier protecting to the last shilling all the money that went into it to see that it would go out for road purposes. That is a very worthy ambition. I think we will have to go further, taking into consideration the overall situation with regard to road maintenance, the cost of roads and the cost of various specialists in relation to road construction, particularly the suspension of roadways over bog land. We will have to consider the whole problem as a general national one and to see whether it would be practicable to transfer that type of charge from the local authorities to the central authority. We have to face the fact that there is growing local unrest at the profligate cost, particularly the profligate administrative cost of running local authorities.</P>
    <P>My contribution to this Estimate is rather one of inquiry into the general principles behind the development of local government and the segregation of functions as between local authorities and the Department. If I stress that point of view I do so because I intervened in this debate, not on the basis of my local problems, which are many and varied, but to try to direct the Minister's and the House's attention to the fact that there is a necessity for a general overhaul of our whole concept of local government. There is a dire necessity for the cutting down of the duality of purposes of the local authorities and the Department and for cutting down in a reasonable and practical way the overlapping services both in the central Department and the local authorities and, added to that, there is a necessity for the Department to investigate the practicability of making certain charges now levied on local authorities a central charge collected in a different way from the present collection methods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> This has become a problem which is eating into the confidence of many people in this State. It is becoming a very wearisome burden, particularly on the small-salaried and much-despised white collar worker. Apart from the specific and general problems which may be referred to in this debate, I would impress on the Minister that the time has come for a complete overhaul of the perspective of the Department in regard to the local authorities, for a definition of functions, and for the removal of many of the overlapping functions as between the two, thereby bringing about a saving not only for the taxpayer but, in many instances, a saving of substantial sums of money for the local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this country we have become too prone to allowing large, cumbersome and expensive machines to grow up centrally and locally without getting down to the task of making people do work of a more directly productive nature. I think that in this field of local authority and local government administration there is room for a tremendous advance, an advance that can be made by reasonable investigation and sensible planning to integrate the departments for the purpose of doing away with overlapping and delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if he is aware that the lack of an adequate and effective dimming system renders a high proportion of vehicles a menace on the road; that this applies particularly to (i) trucks, lorries and buses operated by C.I.E.; (ii) most privately-owned trucks and lorries; (iii) a low-powered, popular model, family passenger car manufactured by a firm of long standing, and (iv) many old vehicles, and that, in consequence, many avoidable accidents occur; and, if so, if he will introduce proposals for legislation to remedy this state of affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal with the subject matter of that question, No. 47, also Question No. 48, and another question in which the Department of Local Government is mentioned, No. 32. I might also say that, in view <Col N="680" /> of the fact that I have taken this opportunity to speak on the Estimate, I do not propose to raise the matter on the Adjournment to-night. In his reply to Question No. 47, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to the terms of the Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (Construction, Equipment and Use) (Amendment) Order, 1948, which requires every mechanically propelled vehicle to be equipped with a dimming device maintained in good efficient order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since I received the reply from the Minister I have looked at the particular Order and I regret to say that I am as far on now as before I saw it. I confess that I only took a very quick look at it. The order in question is S.I. No. 240 of 1948. It says in Section 2:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In these regulations . . . &lsquo;front lamp&rsquo; means any lamp which is fitted to the front of a vehicle which is not a lamp.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means. I do not know if anybody in the House will be able to enlighten me as to what it does mean. The Irish version says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;ciallaíonn &lsquo;lampa tosaigh&rsquo; aon lampa atá feistithe ar éadan na feithicle agus nach lampa.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that means anything, I would be glad to know what it does mean. If it is effective in law, then I would be glad to know in what way. The Order goes on in Section 6:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every vehicle shall be fitted with a dimming device so constructed that it may be operated with ease by the driver and when so operated the beam of light emitted by any front lamp is ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brings you back to the definition of a front lamp, and if you read that again with the definition of a &ldquo;front lamp,&rdquo; you will find this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every vehicle shall be fitted with a dimming device so constructed that it may be operated with ease by the driver and when so operated the beam of light emitted by any &lsquo;front lamp&rsquo; which is fitted to the front of a vehicle which is not a lamp is</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> (a) altered downwards or both downwards and to the left in direction, or</P>
    <P>(b) diffused or reduced in intensity, or</P>
    <P>(c) extinguished and a new beam brought into operation; or</P>
    <P>(d) extinguished and a new beam from another lamp brought into operation</P>
    <P>in such a manner that it or the new beam so brought into operation is incapable of dazzling any person on the same or approximately the same horizontal plane as the vehicle at a greater distance than 25 feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, does it not seem clear from Section 6 that the driver of any vehicle may extinguish the lamp&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; as we use it in everyday conversation because it is not defined in the regulations&mdash;and bring into operation another lamp on any side of the vehicle, provided only that the beam is capable of dazzling, on approximately the same horizontal plane, at a greater distance than 25 feet? Does it not seem abundantly clear, therefore, that under the law at the moment all you have to do is to fit a beam practically underneath your left front main lamp, and for the purposes of this regulation bring that beam into operation, thereby leaving the entire right side of the car in the dark and undefined in the case of those coming against you?</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this. Before I finish, I hope to persuade the House and the Minister of the necessity of making fresh regulations or, alternatively, to bring in legislation which is properly clarified and defined so as to put this situation in order. May I mention, without casting any aspersion on him, that the Minister for Local Government who signed that Order in 1948 was the late Deputy T. J. Murphy? I am not blaming him in any way. I had the misfortune to travel from Boyle to Naas in County Kildare, a fortnight ago, and from there back again. It so happened that this journey was on a Friday when I had already travelled from Leinster <Col N="682" /> House down to my constituency. Therefore, I had three very long journeys in the one day. It happens that when you are a little bit tired you are inclined to notice these difficulties more sharply than if you were at the top of your form. This was a dark, wet, miserable night.</P>
    <P>Something which I have been intending to do for the past couple of years, I then made up my mind to do as quickly as possible. That was to try to bring sufficiently to the notice of this House the fact that about 70 per cent. of the vehicles which are using the roads at the present time at night time are nothing short of a menace on the roads. I am not saying that C.I.E. are particularly offensive in this respect, and I do not wish to be offensive in any way to C.I.E. I merely say that on this particular journey the person who was with me made a study of the buses, trucks, lorries and cars that we met. The buses, trucks and lorries operated by C.I.E. were particularly dangerous in this respect. I submit they were keeping within these regulations, if that meant anything which I seriously doubt, in putting out entirely the right lamp in front of their vehicles. I am also submitting that any large truck which entirely extinguishes the right light is far more dangerous than if it did not dim at all, because then you do not know the size of the vehicle which is approaching you and there is an area of the road which is entirely blacked out from your vision. In addition, there is an area of the road which is not as well illuminated as it should be, and as it would be, if the two lights on the approaching vehicle were in operation and if the drivers were compelled to dim in such a way that they could not dazzle at a greater distance than 25 feet.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. buses are equally to blame. I simply do not accept the statement that the state of affairs which existed during the strike has now been rectified. I think that the Order made in 1948, which is supposed to govern this matter of dimming devices on vehicles, is absolutely meaningless, and, therefore, that the Guards are utterly powerless to deal with it even though they <Col N="683" /> must know that these rather dangerous vehicles are on the road.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this problem to which I want to draw the particular attention of the House. At the present time we are expending an awful lot of money on the various trunk roads of the country, and very properly, I think, in doing that we are straightening out dangerous bends, we are removing dangerous bridges and we are banking the roads where necessary. In general, we are making it easy for people who are travelling long distances to do the journey quickly and comfortably. The real danger at night time is the straight road and not the crooked road. The real need for adequate and effective dimming devices arises on a straight road at night time, and particularly on a bad night. It is not nearly as dangerous, under any sort of conditions, on a road that has been widened as it is on a dead-straight road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have most excellent lights on my car. That reminds me of another point. I had to refer reluctantly to a popular model car, though I had no intention of mentioning the model. In my opinion, every single one of these cars is equipped with an inadequate and ineffective dimming device. I do not care what the law is, the fact remains that there is one particular model of a car which is entirely unequipped in this respect. I understand that is not the fault of the firm which manufactures it, and that they placed a contract with another firm for the purpose of supplying these lamps. What I have said applies very much to privately owned lorries and trucks. Most of these are operated on a 24 h.p. battery. When one of these approaches, if the driver does not dim you can hardly see it at all. I regret to have to say that the road manners of a great number of drivers in this country are in inverse ratio to the size of the car or truck they are driving. These fellows come along with their enormous trucks, and if some unfortunate <Col N="684" /> poor fellow in a Fiat, a Hillman or a Ford, or any one of the smaller cars, comes up against them, he has no chance. They do not give a hang whether they dim or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission is that the regulations are not there and that if they are they are being completely ignored. The problems that I have mentioned are there and what I am trying to do is to give some specific instances to the House. The Government should immediately frame fresh regulations to take the place of regulations made in 1948 and, in particular, to ensure that it will be against the law for a person to turn off one lamp completely and leave the other one the same as it was without dimming it at all.</P>
      <P>I also wanted to deal with the question of rear lights, which is referred to in Question No. 32 to-day directed to the Minister for Justice, and the reply to which referred to the Minister for Local Government. The question was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice if he will now make regulations differentiating minor from major roads, rendering it obligatory on all to come to a stop before emerging from a minor to a major road; and generally classifying roads and thereby giving effect to the practice long since adopted in other countries and envisaged by previous legislation in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got the heartening reply that legislation to remedy this and other defects is being prepared by the Minister for Local Government. I hope the Minister will press ahead with this work as quickly as possible. The condition <Col N="685" /> of the law with regard to this matter at the moment is archaic and the number of cases coming into the courts&mdash;and which would hardly ever need come into the courts&mdash;as a result of the lack of these regulations is very great. In other countries a vehicle emerging from a minor on to a major road has to come to a dead stop along a white line. It is high time we brought that regulation into this country. If we are building straight, wide main thoroughfares from here to Cork or Sligo or Belfast, I think it is our duty to bring in regulations that any person who comes out on such a road does so at his own peril. That regulation will protect the person coming from the minor road every bit as much as the person using the main road.</P>
    <P>I also referred in Question No. 48 to the requirements of the law regarding rere lights and reflectors on trucks, lorries and buses, and intimated that I thought the present requirements of the law were inadequate. The Minister replied that he was not so aware and if it should become necessary to revise the present regulations there appeared to be ample power in the Road Traffic Act of 1933 without amending legislation. I have looked up the Act of 1933 since and I am quite satisfied the Minister is perfectly right in what he said. There is ample power under the Road Traffic Act to bring in the regulations which I suggested, but these regulations have not been brought in.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago, when I was in France, being particularly impressed by the fact that every large truck with a trailer had between 12 and 15 lights or reflectors. It had two main lamps in front which, with the side lamps, made four; there were two small red lights showing the limits left and right at the top, making six; it had a red light and a white light at the back, making eight; it had a triangular affair in front which, I think, is obligatory by law for these lorries; that is nine. It had four lights on the back of the trailer which was attached to the lorry. That makes 13. There was no question about it&mdash;you could not fail to see this thing, no matter at <Col N="686" /> what angle you approached it, whether from the back or the front. Unfortunately it seems to be adequate in this country to have a red rere light which is about the size of the thumbnail for huge trucks such as are now using the roads daily more and more. Some very serious accidents have resulted from the defective or inadequate rere lights and a very good school friend of my own was killed in unfortunate circumstances. I say here and now that he would not have been killed, in all probability, had the particular truck he crashed into carried suitable rere lights and reflectors.</P>
    <P>I think that is about all I have to say on this matter. I might conclude by saying that I hope I have convinced the House that it is necessary (1) to revoke an Order of 1948 which I think I have shown to be meaningless; (2) to make regulations for which the Minister has power under the 1933 Act in regard to rere lights on lorries, trucks, cars and buses, and (3) to make regulations reclassifying roads throughout the country. If the Minister does make regulations regarding this question of dimming devices, he might consider making it obligatory on every person who owns any sort of motor vehicle to report once every six months to the local authority or some such body for the purpose of having an examination carried out on the apparatus installed and in order to make sure that the lights are properly focussed. I understand there is equipment available now which makes it a matter of a few moments to focus lights properly. I dislike ever advocating anything which will restrict private citizens more than is necessary, or&mdash;to put it in another way&mdash;making the country more bureaucratic than it is at the moment, but I would suggest that even adequate dimming devices are not sufficient if you have not some statutory power to make a person report every now and again for examination of the device to show that it is in proper working order. That is all I have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government Estimate gives local representatives of councils an opportunity of drawing attention to grievances, and <Col N="687" /> every member of the House who has spoken has very rightly done so and has emphasised the position regarding houses. It will bear repetition. I wish to avail of the opportunity to draw attention to the need for increased housing so far as providing necessary employment for the many thousands who are now idle or seeking employment in Great Britain is concerned. A good many of our skilled men are seeking jobs in Great Britain, and I am afraid they will be a loss to our country, because two or three years ago we made an appeal to them to come back to this country and said that they would have reasonable employment spread over&mdash;I remember in one case it was stated&mdash;at least ten years. These people are going away in great numbers. I would suggest in the City of Dublin there is need for at least 15,000 houses at the moment. We have 8,000 to 10,000 people with five in one room. We have 500 or 600 people with six persons in one room. The corporation acquired sites on the outskirts of the city&mdash; which I intend to complain about&mdash;not the acquisition of the sites but the distance the people have to go to them. In acquiring these sites we are making an effort to build 2,500 houses per year. Dublin Corporation is the biggest landlord of the greatest number of people in this country&mdash;I think we have over 30,000 tenants at the moment. We wish it was 50,000, because that is what is required for the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our efforts to house the people, we acquired a big number of tenement houses and I, personally, thought as a Dublin representative that what would happen would be that the moment we got a certain number of people out of these rotten tenements we would pull them down and rebuild in the centre of the city again. Unfortunately, we are not doing that to any great extent. We are building houses on the outskirts of the city for people who work in the centre of the city. Indeed, some of these people are unemployed and are drawing benefit in Gardiner Street and Beresford Place. They are compelled to travel a long distance into the city for the purpose of signing up at the labour exchange. In many cases <Col N="688" /> increased bus fares to and from work amount to as much as £1 per week. I know families in Finglas and Ballyfermot who are paying that in bus fares out of their week's wages. I know parents who are going without in order to give their children decent accommodation.</P>
    <P>I do not want more departmental interference but I think the time has come when encouragement must be given for rebuilding on the derelict sites in the centre of the city. Substantial blocks of flats could be constructed on these, with three-roomed, four-roomed and two-roomed flats. Those housed in these flats would be living in proximity to churches, schools and shops. The shopkeepers in Dorset Street, Hardwicke Street and the Grenville Street areas are suffering because of the reduction in the local population due to the movement out from the city to building schemes in Coolock, Raheny and elsewhere. These shopkeepers have contributed heavily in rates towards the building of these houses in the new areas. They are not exactly in a panic because they believe that something will be done, but their general complaint is that we have taken away their customers from them. The shopkeepers in Dorset Street, Grenville Street and Hardwicke Street are having a very bad time.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that next year we will transfer 1,800 families out to Coolock and Raheny. The bus fare will be 7d. and most of these people are employed in the centre of the city. While 1,800 families will be sent out we propose building 500 flats in the centre of the city. I think that should be reversed. We should at least increase that 500 to 1,800 in order to keep the people in the city. Every type of business is beginning to feel the loss in population in the city area. At the moment there is room in Whitefriars' Street Schools for an extra 700 or 800 children. Every time a new housing scheme is completed on the outskirts a new church and a new school have to be built. When these schemes are in process of preparation, sites for schools and churches should be provided free of charge.</P>
    <P>Smithfield is one of the finest open <Col N="689" /> areas we have in the city. I would like to see erected there a skyscraper of 15 or 16 storeys with self-contained centrally heated flats, fitted with lifts to bring the people up and down. In that way we could keep hundreds of people near the places where they work and they would save considerably on bus fares. Cork Street is practically derelict and the shops all round the Coombe are gradually going downhill. There are no great signs of prosperity in that area. The Minister did say something about the south quays and the corporation will get a certain encouragement in that respect. All along the south quays houses that have fallen down are being turned into warehouses, scrap-iron yards and coal yards. When tenements are demolished blocks of suitable flats should be built immediately on the same sites in order to keep the people close to their employment, their schools and their churches. It is inhuman to send old people such long distances out of the city. Suitable one-roomed or two-roomed flats with a kitchenette would meet their needs. I appeal to the Minister to encourage local authorities to rebuild on these derelict sites and restore old Dublin to its former prosperity. Let him give the shopkeepers and the private builders a chance.</P>
    <P>In former days people would build small terraces of houses and let them at fairly reasonable rents. That practice no longer exists in Dublin. We should encourage building of houses, whether by increased grants or by making it easier to get grants. That would be a long-term investment because in the course of seven to ten years the occupants of the houses would be paying full rates. By providing good housing we could reduce the expenditure on health schemes.</P>
    <P>There is a site in Dublin between Arnott's famous drapery store and the entrance to the Anglesea Market on which there are condemned wooden huts 100 years old. That site is 250 yards from Nelson Pillar. I would suggest that somebody or some combine should clear that area and build a skyscraper block of flats. That <Col N="690" /> would create custom for the traders of Moore Street and Parnell Street and the area generally.</P>
    <P>People are being sent seven and eight miles to housing schemes outside the city. Why not encourage the building of blocks of flats in the city area which would provide custom for shops, children for the schools and congregations for the churches? In London and New York there are huge blocks of flats. In Dublin speculative builders have built luxury flats which are let at £3 10s. a week. Recently someone started an agitation to clear derelict sites in Dublin and to make parking places of them. Why not build houses on them for the people?</P>
    <P>Twenty-five years ago the Dublin Corporation built houses in Cabra on what was formerly grazing land. We were told that the acquisition and development of that site would adversely affect cattle dealers and cattle breeders. That is not the case. These people went further out. I appeal to the members of this House to take an interest in the capital city and to see that it will not be turned into a city of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>At the back of the Gresham Hotel there is a street called Waterford Street. I agitated for years to have that site cleared. It has been cleared and the people who formerly lived in the tenement houses there have gone to Coolock and Raheny. In my opinion the proper thing to do would be to build blocks of flats in Waterford Street for these people rather than have them sent out to land that could have been used to produce food. One thousand people have gone out of that area in the last three years and I helped to get them out but, instead of making that site a parking place, I would suggest that handsome flats should be built there, such as the luxury flats in Mespil Road or other parts of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation. Three or four names, all splendid contractors, usually appear on tenders for housing contracts. Many small builders who are equipped to build 40 or 50 houses are idle. Why could we not tell these small builders to build <Col N="691" /> 50 houses, on which grants would be paid and which would qualify for all the assistance that is given to encourage people to build their own homes? The builders could be given a guarantee that the corporation would buy the houses on completion.</P>
    <P>These are not my own ideas. All public men have to get their ideas from the people whom they meet&mdash; bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters. Two plasterers went to Canada last night. Many well-known, high-class builders, who give splendid value, have closed down their yards. Their equipment is getting rusty. These men ask to be given a chance. One of them whom I met to-day asked me to put that idea forward and said that he would be glad to build 40 houses on that basis. He said that the money should be paid on completion of the houses as such builders could not afford to wait for a few weeks for the money. It is a pity to see workmen going away while people are clamouring for houses.</P>
    <P>Last Easter there was a draw for houses for newly-weds in the Mansion House. Two hundred houses were allotted to newly-weds. There were 2,700 applications for them. That meant that 2,500 went away brokenhearted and in tears. I was there and saw them, and others saw the people going away in tears because of their failure to get a cottage or a house. I heard people saying: &ldquo;She will have to wait another year and go back to her mother's floor in a tenement house with two families in one room, and her young husband will have to go back to his mother. She will go to her mother and bring the baby with her.&rdquo; That is Dublin to-day. There is no doubt about it. The Minister can, I am sure, get the list of applicants, the number of young married people who cannot get a room to live in. When a baby arrives the wife has to go back to her mother and the young boy goes back to his mother where there might be six or seven of his brothers in the one single room. That is not Christian treatment of our citizens, and something ought to be done quickly about it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he would <Col N="692" /> consider another point which has been mentioned and which I am only putting up to him. We had the Artisans' Dwellings Company, a grand organisation, that built a huge number of two-roomed, three-roomed and four-roomed cottages all over the city. Is it not possible to treat the Artisans' Dwellings Company as you would the Dublin Corporation, the local authority, and give them every encouragement, and ask them to apply for sites, help them to get sites, and give them encouragement and grant and every subsidy you can give to a local authority &mdash;give that to the company or any company that will come together for such a purpose? There are a number of benevolent individuals willing to come and give their time to an organisation like that, for the sake of those people with small families who have no chance at present of getting accommodation. We must deal with the large families. Small families of two or three will get a cottage or a flat if there is T.B. in the family, but the average young boy or girl with one or two children is getting no chance whatsoever and nobody is building for them. I say it is not playing the game. It is not Christian treatment. It is not a Christian outlook to see that happen.</P>
    <P>I wrote down a few lists here which I have already mentioned. I have drawn attention to the fact that we have derelict sites waiting for development. We are building 2,500 houses per year and hope to increase that amount. Another small point to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention is the case of a number of young people, boy and girl, the clerk type, or storeman, who have £7 or £8 a week, and have no chance if they have one or two children. Such a man appeals to the corporation for a site, and the corporation gets 200 or 300 applications for ten or 12 sites, and they do not give them to them. I am not saying anything behind my colleagues' backs. I think there are ten of us members of this committee; but is it right to charge those people £10 or £12 a year ground rent? I remember the days when we talked of the absentee landlords charging £5 or £7 a year for a site to build a house, and we called them names and abused them, and then I <Col N="693" /> think of what is happening to-day. Is it not possible to let those people who are going to undertake the responsibility of building their own home out of a wage of £10 a week have a site free of charge or at a nominal figure? I know what people will say&mdash;that you cannot give the citizens' property away &mdash;but you are not giving it away. You are encouraging them to come in and build houses and to come into paying rates after that period of seven years, and I think, as I said before, that it is a good long-term investment, and it will eventually pay the corporation to give them a site at a nominal figure of £1 a year instead of charging £10 or £12. When I asked the question, I was very properly told by the official, who has a certain responsibility: &ldquo;We are making nothing out of it. Think of what it costs when we compulsorily acquire an area for housing.&rdquo; But these people are not giving us the same trouble. We are not doing as much for that type as we would be building houses ourselves with the Government subsidy and the corporation grant and the supplementary grant. A site free of charge could go in as part of some official encouragement, subsidy or something else, but it is not fair to charge young people £10 or £12 a year for sites out on the Swords road, between here and the airport. I know houses in Dublin City on the main roads which have half an acre of garden, with eight or ten rooms in the houses, and they still, because they are old, are only £5 a year. I do put these things to my colleagues, because I know that every one of them is sympathetic and that everyone in the House here has the same letters of appeal from his constituents asking him to get them cottages or flats. I have as many applications to me personally to my house for single rooms as I have for cottages and flats. I am not able to get them a room and, unfortunately, the boy and girl will have to separate, the girl, as I said, will have to go to her mother and he to his mother. These things should not happen in 1953 in our Republic with the freedom that we have and that they were promised. Surely there is no freedom or contentment for those unfortunate people who know no contentment or freedom.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House but it is <Col N="694" /> only right that I should mention these points. I have talked about the Smith-field area, the Townsend area, and Hardwicke Street specially, and Newmarket Street, Cork Street and the Coombe, Thomas Street and High Street. One thing I would suggest is to encourage people to come back to the city to build flats. We have millions of pounds invested under the roadways. We have sewers, main drainage schemes, the telephone, electricity, and millions of pounds worth of copper from the Pigeon House from the days of Larry Kettle when he attacked the laying of electricity from the Pigeon House to the City of Dublin. I say unhesitatingly that there are millions of pounds worth of services in the centre of the city which can take more &mdash;more sewers, more waterpipes, more electric cables&mdash;and everything you can think of is in the centre of the city, yet we are passing by those areas, shutting our eyes to some of the loveliest sites that are there for development in the centre of the old city.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Moore Market. Our next development is Denmark Street, well known to all of you who go to the Broadstone, where there are houses with seven, eight or ten families living together. The corporation is going to clear that area, and where are the people going to out of Denmark Street? They will be going to Raheny or out to Bulloch. Is it right or proper to drive them out there? They have no say themselves. Some of them may say to an alderman or a councillor: &ldquo;Do not send me such a distance. My man will lose his job. How can he get in at 6 o'clock in the morning when there is no bus there?&rdquo; Another would say: &ldquo;My man is not strong enough to ride a bicycle and how can he get in?&rdquo; Some of them have refused a cottage because there is no provision for transport and it is more important to keep a job than to get a house at a distance.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that we ought to build upwards and not outwards. Give the people lifts and central heating. Ten years ago I mentioned this matter of central heating to my colleagues. The idea of flats with central heating was turned down by our local <Col N="695" /> authorities in Dublin because of the terrible cost involved. Central heating in flats would save the people having to go up four or five flights of stairs in tenement houses with a bag of coal or a bag of wet turf. Something ought to be done to prevent the entire City of Dublin going to ruin.</P>
    <P>I mentioned several times in this House the need for playing grounds and playing pitches and I put to one Minister that he ought to encourage the provision of swimming pools in the Phoenix Park. You would not see the space you would have to take up in the Phoenix Park to provide the best swimming pool in the world. There you could have the swimming championships of the world. There is no city in Europe doing less for its children by way of providing playing grounds, playing fields and swimming pools than Dublin. Go to any part of the outskirts of London and you will see magnificent blocks of flats. You will also see big hoardings with the caption: &ldquo;These sites have been presented by so-and-so as playing grounds for the children of such-and-such an area.&rdquo; It is a pity that we do not take on the idea of playing grounds, playing fields and parish halls.</P>
    <P>I have a grievance against that frustrated machine in the Custom House. I can call it nothing else. When the Dublin Corporation give guarantees to the Government that they will try to take 500 men off the unemployment roll in order to have peace and prosperity in the country and when we apply for facilities we are frustrated by the machine in the Custom House. The Minister may have splendid officials. I believe he has, but his officials are no more splendid than the officials we have in the corporation. We have heads of departments in the corporation who could travel the world. We have officials in the engineering and housing sections who are the equal of anybody. I would rather take their views on anything affecting the City of Dublin than those of any member of the machine in the Custom House. One of my colleagues said that we get co-operation from the Minister, but <Col N="696" /> he is in the habit of saying we get splendid support. But he did not say we got splendid support in our efforts to provide employment. I am talking about the members of a committee known as the employment emergency committee. We are anxious to employ 400 more men on all classes of work. Members of the corporation see what is to be done. They suggest to the manager works that could be done, such things as painting the railings of houses, etc. I would suggest that the Minister ask his officials to be more co-operative with the corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister used words to the effect that he was as anxious as anyone else to give the elected representatives of local authorities fuller powers to co-operate with their county and city managers. We, in the Dublin Corporation, co-operate with the city manager. He does his work magnificently. The Minister should ask his officials to give us more co-operation. If he does that, I hope we will have 500 more men working within the next couple of weeks. We are anxious to put more men into employment.</P>
    <P>It may do the House no harm to know that the engineer in charge of the emergency employment scheme&mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo;: I want to get away from that if I can&mdash; said, in relation to the return got from the 400 men on the relief list: &ldquo;I am getting a return of 99 per cent. by way of valuable work from the workers recruited.&rdquo; That, coming from him, is a tribute to the workers of Dublin. These people want work at a fair wage. They have given proof that they want work. It is recorded by the engineer who employs them that they give splendid value. He had no disappointments to record so far as the work of the Dublin workers was concerned, whether skilled or unskilled.</P>
    <P>We have at the present moment approximately 15 miles of laneways in charge or otherwise. Some people use these lanes as dumping grounds. In wet weather it is pitiful to see the difficulty encountered in trying to get coal into houses via those laneways which are covered with six and eight <Col N="697" /> inches of mud. Such a state of affairs should not be permitted whether these laneways are in charge or not. Both from a public health point of view and for public cleansing purposes, they should be put in charge. There are quite a number of works on which a few hundred men could be employed. These should be gone ahead with. Men are not put on any work in the corporation if the sum of money provided for the work does not contain a 60 per cent. element of wages for the men. At least 60 per cent. of the amount provided has to be for wages. We are making many new pathways and we hope to have more painting done. The Government could do a lot more in the painting line. Buildings could do with painting and the paint brush ought to be used.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the question of the clearance of derelict sites. I did ask the corporation whether anything could be done in this connection. There is a terrace of houses in Buckingham Street, five storeys high. There is some regulation that where you demolish by tender, whoever gets the contract allows £500 for the debris. Because of difficulties in that connection the work has not been proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I was asked by a couple of people to inquire whether it was really necessary to import timber from Russia. I do not know whether it was necessary or not but it created very bitter feeling.</P>

      <P>I realise that and I will not pursue the matter further. I think it was Deputy Seán Collins who drew atttention to the heavy burden borne by ratepayers. It should not be too difficult to from a special committee of people with great brains who would devise some means of removing from the shoulders of the ratepayers burdens which should be accepted by national funds. I have no idea what the next demand of the Dublin Corporation will be but I am sure that there will be an increase on last year's demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> There is another matter I want to raise. Perhaps I have a swelled head so far as the importance of Dublin City is concerned when I compare it with New York and London. However, I believe Dublin is a grand city and the main thoroughfares are such that we can take great pride in them. I often wonder why we cannot have underground tubes within the city, say, from Earl Street to Henry Street, from Burgh Quay to Aston's Quay, and one at College Green. These tubes would ease the traffic difficulties and minimise the danger for people crossing the roads. The day has come when we must look for the same amenities we see in many other countries in the world. This Government, the last Government and other Governments have shown how improvements can be made. We are glad to be able to boast that we go in for nothing but the best, and we point with pride to our airport. The Government and all the public representatives should have the same view on other progressive amenities. We ought to have tubes and we ought to have underground and overhead systems of traffic for pedestrians at dangerous crossings.</P>
    <P>I think I have said all I want to say about Dublin. I listened attentively to what the other members who spoke for the country districts had to say. In order to get an opportunity of speaking I sat here for hours upon hours, and I must say it was worth while because the discussion was very interesting. I meet young countrymen who come from the constituencies of various other Deputies. They come up from the country because they cannot find employment at home. They are here a couple of months when they are obliged to go across to Liverpool, and goodness knows what happens to them there.</P>
    <P>It is a pity to lose such a very large proportion of our young men to foreign lands. They used to go to discover America&mdash;we all know the old song <i>Off to Philadelphia in the Morning</i>&mdash; but it is not America they are discovering now, it is England. I hope the Government will be able to devise some means of keeping these young men at home. Is it not possible to build cottages for them and give them <Col N="699" /> an opportunity of getting married and settling down on the land? I would say that when a person goes away there are ten chances to one that he will not come back. If the Government was prepared to provide accommodation for every young man who wants to stay on the land, the situation would be less serious. If the Government provided such people with cottages and if they were to guarantee good prices for the food they produce, and facilitate the export of surplus production, a great deal of employment would result. Other amenities such as a parish hall and electric light would result in removing the drabness which is said to exist in country life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have been underground for a few minutes let us come to the surface for a while. I think the housing problem is a national rather than a local problem. I want to congratulate Deputy Byrne for his contribution to the debate. He is always pleading in his own forcible way for the people of Dublin and I would like to pay him this compliment. On some occasions when people from my constituency come up to Dublin to employment and wish to get married and settle down here, they sometimes find themselves in distress and in need of a house. Very often they have made representations to me to make representations to someone in the city. My best approach in all cases was through Deputy Alfred Byrne and I wish to thank him publicly here in the House for all he has done in that connection.</P>
      <P>Housing is a national problem, but it is also a local problem. It has to be met by taxation, from the taxpayers or the ratepayers. Taxation and rates have reached colossal heights&mdash;not altogether due to housing but to the other services rendered to the public. The rate problem is serious and will become more so as time goes on. I appeal to the Minister to take some steps to allay the pressure on the ratepayers and taxpayers as far as he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became a member of a local authority in Roscommon we had a certain number of staff there, and it was absolutely necessary. That was ten or <Col N="700" /> 11 years ago, when I first entered public life. I venture to say that at present the number of officials employed by Roscommon County Council must have doubled. From one point of view that may not be bad, as it means giving employment, but it cuts the other way also as they have to be paid out of the rates. To a great extent I blame the Department for indirectly having increased our staff in Roscommon. Quite a number of things which I hold should be dealt with by the central authority have been passed on to the local bodies, which means that more people must be put into employment and the rates have to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>In the Department itself there is a big number of officials. I wonder if they all could justify their existence. In my own county the officials can justify their existence, but I wonder if those in the Department can do so. I wonder if we are getting from them the services we should get, compared with the number employed. I often wonder where our vast host of civil servants were absorbed, into what Departments they went, after the emergency. The Ceann Comhairle has pulled me up and said the Minister is not responsible for this, but I must say I believe a big number of those officials were absorbed into this Department, resulting in overstaffing. That tends to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>I have said housing is a national problem. The Department plays a very big part in dealing with it, in arranging for the provision of houses. I am glad to inform the Minister that in County Roscommon we have almost solved our urban housing problem&mdash;our 1947 commitments have been nearly completed &mdash;yet we have the rural problem. Perhaps we are a bit slow in dealing with it. I wish to compliment the officers of my county council who have been instrumental in securing loans at a very moderate rate of interest. They secured them at 3¾ per cent., whereas if they had not made provision early to secure them we would be paying 5¾ per cent. now&mdash;an additional 2 per cent., which would mean a considerable extra burden on the ratepayers of the county. In that way, we have something <Col N="701" /> to be proud of in Roscommon. Like all people, however, we have something to grumble about. In housing our grumble is that the planning was not carried out on the best lines. Deputy Alfred Byrne has mentioned Dublin.</P>
    <P>I come into Dublin every week and from Lucan into the city there is a continuous stream of houses along the main road. That applies also to a lesser degree in country areas, where houses are built along the main roads and spread out over a large area. As a result, the water mains, sewerage, E.S.B. and other amenities involve heavy expenditure. I think it is a disgrace that this should happen, as in the case of Lucan&mdash;I suppose the same thing applies on other sides of the city &mdash;where houses are strung out for miles outside the city. One may be boastful that Dublin is getting bigger, but that should not be any boast as long as things are done in that way. I do not want congestion, or houses built up against one another&mdash;I would like to see a man having a nice garden and a railing&mdash;but I would like a little more concentration. Valuable land is being taken up which could be used for the production of food instead of spreading out houses on it.</P>
    <P>Housing, in the main, is slowing down. Many factors contribute to that &mdash;particularly the rate of interest, which has gone up considerably in the last 12 months. The increase of 2 per cent. has retarded the building of houses and will continue to retard it. Special consideration should be given to the question of interest. An effort should be made to encourage rather than discourage the building of houses. The rates of interest should be reduced to the level they were at some months ago. We have almost solved our housing problem in Roscommon. That is a blessing in one way, but from another point of view it may not be a blessing at all. Certainly we have provided the houses. That is a wonderful achievement and I am very proud of it&mdash;but as a result of the completion of the scheme started in 1947 we have on the labour exchange now a number of people who cannot find employment since the schemes have been completed. What are they to do?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> There is no work for them in the neighbouring county and no work in Dublin. They are standing at the street corners unemployed.</P>
    <P>Houses should be provided for the people, but other employment should be available now. There is no use in finishing the schemes if the men are to go on the dole and become part of those unfortunates who were forced to extract from the Exchequer last year a total of £1,635,000. That money would be better invested in some productive employment. At the same time, of course, we must provide for the unemployed and must pay them something. The unemployed are decent, honourable people who should be provided with work. That problem crops up in Roscommon. The Minister should have a consultation with the Government about it. Where schemes are almost completed, there is bound to be unemployment. In Roscommon we have skilled men, tradesmen and ordinary labourers who have finished the work on housing projects and now have nothing to keep them going, so they are on the unemployed list.</P>
    <P>Fairly generous grants have been given for the main roads and I cannot complain about them. The Minister is inclined to be boastful and say this is a substitute for the cut in grants in other directions. We can talk about that later. I would say that the grants for county roads should be stepped up considerably.</P>
    <P>I have heard many of the Deputies refer, during the course of this debate, to county roads. In my constituency, the county roads, or link roads, or whatever you care to call them, are in a poor and a dilapidated condition and they are by no means capable of carrying the traffic which passes over them at present. Our main roads are in a fairly good state: as a matter of fact, I should like to see them better. However, in my view, it would be desirable to take a small amount of the grant for main roads and to devote that money towards improving our county roads. Our county roads require immediate attention in view of the traffic which they now have to carry.</P>
    <P>Our roads were never intended to carry the traffic which they are carrying <Col N="703" /> at present. In some instances, very excessive burdens are being placed on the roads. Sometimes you will see a heavy tractor or a ten-ton lorry, attached to which may be a very heavy trailer, travelling along our county roads. Some limitation should be put on the use by very heavy traffic of roads which are not capable of carrying the burden. Anybody standing on the roadside when heavy traffic is passing over such roads can feel the vibration of that traffic on the road&mdash; and that vibration lasts for some time after the traffic has, in fact, passed over it. The greatest offenders in that respect are C.I.E. I understand that there is a law in regard to excessively heavy traffic passing over roads which are unable to bear it, and I also understand that offenders can be made amenable to the law if the roads are damaged by them. C.I.E. lorries are doing immense damage on certain roads and there should be some curtailment of their activities in that respect.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of bridges &mdash;railway bridges and bridges over rivers and canals&mdash;on our main and county roads. On my journey from my home to Dublin I cross seven or eight of these bridges. I do not know who is responsible for them: it may be the Department of Local Government or it may be the railway company or the canal company. A very great need exists for the improvement of these bridges. Motorists and pedestrians who are in the course of crossing them cannot see what traffic is coming towards them. There have been quite a number of serious crashes on the main road between the place where I live and Dublin. Some immediate steps should be taken to remove or at least to level out the extraordinary humps on these railway bridges.</P>
    <P>Almost every Deputy who has spoken in this debate has mentioned the Local Authorities (Works) Act. I feel like saying, in regard to that Act, may the Lord have mercy upon it, because I fear that if that Act is not already dead, it is dying, and more is the pity. I am very sorry indeed that that should be so, because it was one <Col N="704" /> of the greatest pieces of legislation ever passed by this House. The memory of the man who introduced that Act, and piloted it through this House, will linger in this country for long and many a day. I want to make a special appeal to the Minister in regard to that Act. Presumably, he has no funds at his disposal this year to enable him to increase the amounts available under that Act, but I appeal to him now, at this stage, to make provision in next year's Estimate for a substantial amount of money under that Act. I cannot think of any other piece of legislation which was passed during my time as a member of this House which proved more beneficial to the farmers and to the productivity of the country. The Bill itself had a hectic passage through this House, as it was not popular with the Fianna Fáil Party. I think it can truly be said that, on an average, every member of that Party in this House at that time voted against the Bill on eight different occasions. Any honest Deputy will readily admit that that Act enabled considerable improvements to be made in the productivity of our land. I appeal to the Minister to provide a much greater sum of money under that Act in his Estimate next year than he has done this year.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should like to correct a statement which was made by another Deputy from County Roscommon, Deputy McQuillan. I do not believe that Deputy McQuillan deliberately made a misleading statement, but I should like to give the facts of the matter to the House. I am relying on my memory now, but I think that what I say will be borne out by a reference to Deputy McQuillan's speech in the Official Report. Deputy McQuillan stated that in the first year the Local Authorities (Works) Act was implemented&mdash;1949&mdash; the Roscommon County Council made a grave mistake in not making application for a much larger sum of money than, in fact, they applied for. They received £52,000. Deputy McQuillan said that had he been a member of the county council at that time he would not have made that mistake. I suppose that I could say that if I were alive at the time of the Flood, I would have <Col N="705" /> taken action to prevent it by turning off the tap. It is very easy to make statements like that. Deputy McQuillan was not a member of the Roscommon County Council at that time. I should like to give the facts of the case. The 26 councillors on the Roscommon County Council submitted proposals, through the county manager, for the carrying out of certain works. The amount of money which it was estimated would be required to implement these proposals was £102,000. Every county councillor pressed vehemently for the carrying out of certain schemes in his own area and claimed a certain proportion of the total sum for works in his own area. Our engineering staff at that time said that it would be physically impossible to spend £102,000 between the date of the allocation of the money and the 31st March, the end of the financial year. I might point out that, at that time, we had full employment in Roscommon. We were engaged in turf-cutting and other projects: nobody was idle. That was the position in 1949.</P>
    <P>I believe myself that it would have been a physical impossibility to spend more than £52,000 in the period in question. That was the amount we spent. Deputy McQuillan alleged that our action in 1949 was a grave mistake in view of the system of providing grants on a percentage basis. I wish to make it quite clear that no mistake was made. We did what we did in good faith, not knowing in advance that the grants would be cut by 50 per cent. in subsequent years. Everything was done correctly and with a full realisation of what we were able to do. We were ambitious for our county. We were informed that any moneys remaining unspent at the end of the financial year could not be carried over into the next year. We made a desperate effort to curtail work on the bogs and the roads in order to get that sum of £52,000 spent. Therefore, in my view the sum of £52,000 was sufficient to keep our workers employed. I may say in passing that we did excellent and useful work with that money. Unfortunately, we are not in that happy position to-day.</P>
    <P>There should be some sort of <Col N="706" /> integration of services between the Department of Local Government, the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works. In making that statement I would remind the House of the excellent drainage work which was carried out in connection with the removal of the Tinnecarra Rock through the co-operation of these three Departments. That work included the drainage of Lough Gara, which revealed a matter of major historical interest. A very large area of land was drained under that scheme. I would advise the Minister to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act to its rightful place in our economy and to deal with it in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works. Under the drainage scheme to which I have just referred thousands and thousands of acres of land were drained&mdash;land which is now a valuable asset to our community. I believe that, generally speaking, there should be a greater co-ordination of services between our different Departments of State.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of housing grants. I am glad to be able to say that the payments have been stepped up somewhat. The matter is, at yet, by no means perfect. There has been some expedition but it is not sufficient, as yet. I attribute the delay to under-staffing. One inspector has the job of dealing with three counties&mdash;County Roscommon, County Westmeath and County Longford&mdash;in the matter of housing grants, inspections, and so forth. I should like to record that the inspector in question is one of the most efficient officials I have ever met but that it is physically impossible for any one man to be in three places at the same time. I suggest that a little bit of assistance from time to time would be helpful to him.</P>
    <P>I have been making discreet inquiries for some time past as to what fees are payable to the appointed officer who comes and inspects the site in connection with the erection of new houses. There is some grumbling in my constituency about these fees and quite a number of people have approached me on the matter, but I find myself in the position that I cannot <Col N="707" /> say definitely what the fees are for the production of a plan and the inspection of a site. In some cases, the fee is £5 and, in other cases, £10 and £11 5s. There is no uniformity and I should like to hear from the Minister what is the exact amount. There seems to be a £10 note hovering around somewhere which does not reach the person who is building the house. I do not know where it goes, but it seems to get lost somewhere. I am not accusing anyone of taking it or getting it, or of being guilty of embezzlement or fraud, because I think everything is above board, but, when a person comes to me to ask why a sum of £10 has been stopped from his cheque, I cannot give the explanation.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also what function public utility societies serve in relation to the building of new houses. I believe the procedure is that, if you pay £2 to such a society, and thus become a member, you get a sum of money which is £10 in excess of the statutory grant. The grant is £275, but if you become a member of a public utility society by paying £2&mdash; I hope I am correct in this&mdash;the amount you receive is £285. If that is the only function these societies serve, I think it could be done by some other means, because I do not like that system. There seems to be something queer about it&mdash;it does not look like business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building of county council hospitals I vigorously and strenuously object to what are known as architect's fees. I think these are, to put it mildly, wholesale plunder. The amount of money eaten up in these schemes is colossal. It is a service which could be done by officers of the local authorities. I understand that in some cases the fee is 10 per cent., which on a building costing £25,000 or £30,000 is a nice gift. I think these fees should either be reduced or abolished altogether and the onus placed on officers of the local authority of doing the architect's work. These people are quite competent and willing to do it but they will not be allowed to do it. The county manager tells us that the Department will not <Col N="708" /> sanction a proposed scheme of building unless there is an architect engaged. That is wrong. If the local authority has officers competent to deal with these matters they should be left to them, because diverting these moneys into the hands of recognised architects means throwing money away for nothing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, may I implore the Minister to see to it that when his Estimate comes before the House again there will be in it a sum equal to the sum expended under that Act in the year 1949? Remember that money spent under that Act is money well spent because there are people who wish to have reclamation jobs carried out on their lands and these reclamation works are held up because the mearing or outside drains are not cleaned. If that Act were operating at high pressure these outside drains would be attended to. It will not surprise me to see that sum of money in the next Estimate because the Minister comes from a rural constituency and must know the value of drainage, but I will feel very happy if in the next Estimate the amount is restored to the figure at which it stood in 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of comment by Dublin Deputies concerning Dublin Corporation's building programme and I should like to add a few words on that subject. In the past six years, 20,000 houses have been built in Dublin City and County and of that number over 10,000 have been built in Dublin itself. The general public are very rightly interested in the building of houses and they feel, again rightly, that we have done a very good job in Dublin in the past few years in that regard. They hope that the problem of housing in Dublin is in process of being solved, but I should like to sound a note of warning in that connection. Far from the problem having been solved, I personally am doubtful if we are doing anything more than holding our own with the influx of people from country areas and with the natural decay of houses which is going on all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> If we want to solve the Dublin housing problem, we will have to gear up building to a much greater speed than at present.</P>
    <P>We build something like 2,500 houses in Dublin every year. That is a tremendous figure on which the corporation are to be congratulated, but I do not wish that we should live in any fool's paradise and think that, in any short time, the problem will be solved. I wonder how many persons realise that considerably over one quarter of the population of Dublin live in corporation houses at present? The city is housing over 25 per cent. of its population at the expense of the citizens, but until we house something over 50 per cent. of the citizens, we will not have solved our problem. I do not think any other city of comparable size in these islands has a problem of the same magnitude as Dublin. A problem such as that cannot be settled across the floor of the House&mdash; it needs very big planning and the expenditure of a great deal more money than is being spent at present, together with the engagement of many more building operatives than are engaged at present in Dublin. It is not something which can be lightly or easily satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his opening speech to the ancillary services and amenities necessary in connection with the Dublin housing drive. That is something that gives us many headaches in the Dublin Corporation. We have, of course, a town planning section in the corporation which in my opinion functions very well, but we are not always free to do what we would like in that respect. I am not blaming the Minister or his Department at the moment for that but one of our difficulties is finance. We are not satisfied that we are given sufficient land for playgrounds and parks in connection with our housing schemes. I personally should like to see the corporation being able to provide much more recreational facilities for our city children. We lag behind most modern conceptions of town planning in that respect. Deputy A. Byrne, who has a very extensive and detailed knowledge of Dublin City and <Col N="710" /> its problems, mentioned here a few moments ago that we ought to have more swimming pools and more playgrounds generally for our children. That is one direction in which the Minister could give us more help. Perhaps we could get larger grants for that type of work. Certainly it is a real problem in the city. I think all citizens will agree with me that we should encourage our young people to keep off the streets and, in order to do that, we must provide them with the means to indulge in healthy recreation.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties at the present moment is the delay which occurs in local government generally. In Dublin we find that when our architects and engineers prepare the very complicated and, indeed, the very detailed plans which are necessary for our schemes, these plans have to be sent to the Minister's Department and they are there scrutinised by another set of, doubtless, very competent officials down to the very smallest detail. We feel in the corporation that some method could be devised by which that double work could be eliminated. There may be reasons why some local authorities, who have not at their command the extensive architectural and engineering staffs which Dublin Corporation have, should in their own interests have their plans scrutinised, but certainly in the case of the Dublin Corporation the fact that every plan has to be gone over by a second set of officials seems to involve unnecessary delay and expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister made mention of the Howth main drainage scheme. I am glad to say that that scheme is being pushed ahead, and I trust that the Minister will do everything on his side to expedite its completion because, until the Howth main drainage scheme is completed, development on the north side of the city and in North County Dublin cannot be carried out to any great extent. Development on the south side of the city has been carried out to such an extent, from the point of view of working-class houses, that the distance from the centre of the city has now become almost too far for any further large schemes on the south side. In that respect, I should like to endorse the statement made by Deputy <Col N="711" /> Byrne that you cannot put people from the slums of Dublin out very far into the country, because it will cost them too much in fares to travel to the centre of the city where they usually work.</P>
    <P>People sometimes say that town planning is unnecessary and that, in fact, it is restrictive of the activities of citizens generally; but the problem which I have just mentioned, in regard to putting people out into the country, is one aspect in regard to which you need wide planning powers. An ideal solution for that problem would be to provide employment for these people adjacent to their homes by giving sites for factories in the neighbourhood and, in fact, that has been done in several instances. That is part of the planning scheme in Dublin but already the sites available for industrial buildings are almost exhausted, so that it is a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Various speakers have referred to the question of the powers of the manager and the powers of councils. I am very happy to say that in Dublin we have a first-class city manager, and in the 12 years or more during which I have been a member of that body, I have never seen any real conflict between the city manager and the elected representatives. We in the corporation feel that if other parts of the country were fortunate enough to have a manager of the type we have, many of their troubles might be overcome. Members of the corporation, however, feel that greater powers should be given to them and to the corporation officials by the Local Government Department.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of conflict between us and the manager. What we want is that more powers be given to the council and the manager as against the Local Government Department. Of course, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and an all-over scheme for Ireland has to be devised, I suppose, to meet the case of the weaker and smaller councils. But, in the City of Dublin, where there is a large corporation and a very large number of highly-skilled and very competent officials, surely a scheme could <Col N="712" /> be devised whereby they would have more powers and would not be subject to the same restrictions as local authorities who have only a very small number of officials.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation have whole departments dealing with various aspects of municipal life and they are perfectly competent to decide for themselves. But, in many cases, they have to get in touch with the Local Government Department and delay is caused which costs the ratepayers money and which, perhaps, holds up the provision of employment. Certainly, in the case of Dublin, I would appeal for a relaxation of these stringent rules. It should be quite possible to devise a scheme whereby the work in Dublin could be speeded up. At the present moment, there is a very grave need for work of all sorts. The housing programme of the local authority and of local authorities in general is being pushed forward, but private building is at the present moment passing through a slack period and it is very important that every bar to the giving of employment should be removed from the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention a matter which a number of Deputies have commented upon and that is the heavy burden of the rates. It is not always realised by members of the public that the rates are carrying all sorts of expenses and burdens which, in my opinion, lie very properly outside the jurisdiction of local authorities. We in the local authorities have to bear the burden of very heavy public health charges in connection with hospitals and clinics and we will have to carry a still heavier burden in that respect.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to relax as far as possible the restrictions which hold back the Corporation of Dublin from carrying out the work which they are very well fitted to carry out. That could be done very simply by giving the corporation the powers which they used to have in the old days for carrying out work without its having to be examined always by a second set of officials.</P>
    <Col N="713" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowe" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I should like to say a few words and to give any advice I can to the responsible Minister. Our great grievance in the rural areas arises from the county rates and housing. The position with regard to the county roads at the present time is desperate and the ratepayers of the country are crying out against it. I have a letter here signed by six farmers asking me to try to do something about a road in a special area in Tipperary, the Glen of Aherlow. Six families live on that road on which there is also a Department's plantation. Sixteen children have to go three miles to school, and, if the weather is wet or bad at all, they have to stay at home owing to the state of the road. I appeal to the Minister to do something in connection with that.</P>
      <P>We have a very good county manager, but when we approach him about any special repairs the cry is: &ldquo;We have no money.&rdquo; The man who owns a motor-car or a lorry says: &ldquo;Why are the roads so bad? I am paying so much; where is our money going?&rdquo; I know that it is costing too much to run this country. I know that mountain and other streams play havoc with the county roads. They wash the grit that should keep the roads together into the dikes and drains. Then we need bridges in several areas. There are roads requiring repair which are not maintained by the county council although they run between two other roads. We need better houses. The farmer of £10 or £12 valuation is not able to build a house for himself as the cost of building is too high. I would, therefore, earnestly appeal to the Minister to provide something like labourers' cottages for the low valuation people. I consider that a farmer of £60 valuation is also entitled to some concession as he may not be very well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our towns also are in a state of decay. I am afraid that many of our city Deputies forget that this is an agricultural country and that 80 per cent. of its wealth comes from the soil. If you have not a happy, prosperous and contented agricultural <Col N="714" /> community, you cannot ever hope to develop industries. In my own county we have the ancient city of the kings, Cashel, without an industry. In the town of Tipperary we have a great many signing on at the labour exchange, a town in which the establishment of an industry would be very useful. Therefore, I would appeal in all earnestness to the Minister to do the best he can for the rural community.</P>
    <P>Why not decentralise? I think this city is top-heavy and that some of the industries in it should be transferred to the country. I have here a letter signed by six farmers from the Glen of Aherlow, a great tourist centre, one of the best in Éire, in which there is ample shooting and fishing to be had. I am prepared to hand it over to the Minister, but the position there at the moment is that their children have to remain at home from school through the absence of a road to travel over to get to school.</P>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to see that electricity is provided for that same area. I know that this question of electricity is not the Minister's responsibility, but the E.S.B. is a semi-State organisation. In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister to act fairly and squarely towards the rural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief in what I have to say on this Estimate. I should like, first of all, to refer to that part of the Minister's opening speech in which he said that the housing needs of the country were almost met. To a certain extent, I agree with him on that. I agree that in the County of Mayo a lot of houses have been built, so that in some towns and villages there no houses are required at the present time. The opposite is the case in other towns and villages, but in the main I would agree with the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, we must consider that in a county like Mayo we have a lot of emigration. Therefore, if there is not a serious demand for housing there at present, it is due to the fact that many of our young boys and girls <Col N="715" /> have been forced to emigrate, due to prevailing economic conditions. That state of affairs has existed for a long number of years. It provides one reason why I must agree with the Minister that, to a certain extent, the present demand for housing has been met. But is that not a regrettable state of affairs, that people who in the ordinary way if they could get employment in their own country would stay at home and would be applicants for houses have been forced to emigrate and provide themselves with houses in foreign countries? Their labour is lost to their own country.</P>
    <P>That state of affairs will continue as long as we have such an attitude by the present Government to this Estimate. The attitude of the present Government and Minister to this Estimate seems to be that colossal sums of money can be spent on non-productive schemes, while at the same time the amount of money which it is proposed to spend on productive schemes is being substantially curtailed. That is a regrettable state of affairs. No one in this House has attempted to deny that agriculture is our basic industry. Tied up with it you have the local authorities works schemes to which it is natural that I, as a farmers' Deputy, would refer. Deputies in other Parties have already done so.</P>
    <P>I want, in the strongest possible way, to offer my criticism against the cutting down of the amount of money proposed to be made available for these schemes which are tied up with the land project scheme. Many farmers are at present prevented from carrying out reclamation work as a result of the cutting down of the grants for local authorities works schemes. If we had our young boys employed on productive work of that kind it would mean, as time went on, that our output of agricultural produce would be substantially increased, that unemployment in the rural areas would be reduced, and that there would be a demand for more and more houses in our rural areas if the young people were not compelled to emigrate. That was a good practical scheme introduced by a Minister in the former Government, <Col N="716" /> and now one might say that it is being almost abolished, for what reason I do not know. I hope it is not for spiteful reasons. After all, good Irishmen gave their lives in days gone by in order to make this country a better one to live in. I suggest that we should forget and be prepared to sink our little differences, that we should pull together and try to build up the country.</P>
    <P>No one will convince me that any Minister of State who sets about cutting down and economising on schemes such as the local authorities works schemes is doing something that is in the national interest. If my humble appeal to him means anything, I would appeal to him to change his attitude with regard to that whole matter. He suggested on previous occasions that some of the work done under those schemes was bad, that it was done in a haphazard way, and that to a great extent money was wasted. I am not satisfied that that is so. Perhaps in the county or constituency which the Minister comes from, work may have been done in that way, but speaking for my own county I can say that the local authorities works schemes carried out there produced beneficial results. I know that there are many farmers in my county who are anxious to apply phosphates or lime to their land, but every Deputy knows that a farmer cannot apply phosphates or lime to land, or cannot till land, that is waterlogged. Therefore, in conjunction with a number of other Deputies, I would appeal to the Minister to change his attitude with regard to local authorities works schemes. There is another important matter that affects my constituency. It is the erection of a bridge at a place called Mountfalcon, midway between Ballina and Foxford. For quite a long time Mayo County Council have been debating this project and in recent times they decided by unanimous vote to go ahead with the erection of the bridge there. It is a very necessary undertaking and a very desirable one. You have the Curroy alcohol factory in the vicinity of this bridge or just a few miles away. You have a considerable acreage of bog in that area, and the tenants are <Col N="717" /> obliged to make a detour for something like seven or eight miles on occasion in order to get to the bog or to the factory to which they supply potatoes. I would appeal to the Minister to make a substantial grant available to assist Mayo County Council in their genuine effort at bringing relief to the people who have been suffering inconvenience and loss for a very long number of years.</P>
    <P>Certain proposals have been put forward, as I have stated, by Mayo County Council to the Minister's Department and I sincerely hope that, unlike in the past, we will now get the co-operation of his Department. We are genuinely sincere and honest in our efforts, and as proof of that there is the fact that we are prepared to put up a substantial sum of money ourselves. I think it is only fair that the Department of Local Government should come to our assistance.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to raise is the question of providing some accommodation for the people of the Lacken area of North Mayo. Many of them, as Deputy Calleary, who is here, will know, have to walk knee-deep in water at Lacken Strand in order to get to Mass. That state of affairs in a Christian country, to my mind, is scandalous. I referred to it here by way of question and otherwise on previous occasions and nothing has been done. I understand the Parliamentary Secretary of the present Government actually went to Lacken on a certain occasion and promised the people that something would be done there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that was the time all right. But by-election or no by-election I think it is a terrible thing that in a Christian country in the year 1953&mdash;and I have seen it with my own two eyes&mdash;people with asses and carts, horses and carts, people walking, old men and young men, old women and young women should have to cross the tide on a Sunday morning on the way to Mass. They have to remove their boots, hold up their pants and try to cross. Any Government that allows <Col N="718" /> that state of affairs to exist cannot, in my opinion, justify its existence. It is no wonder that you have a flight from the western districts. It is easy to get up in this or any other assembly and criticise Ministers for this, that and the other.</P>
      <P>It is easy to get up and say with one side of your mouth: we should have this scheme and that scheme; we should have baths, swimming pools; we should have better roads, footpaths, better housing, and everything else, and at the same time we should bring down rates. I do not want to make the type of speech that the Minister will probably be making later on. But I do say this: in both local and national administration there is quite a lot of waste and I would suggest to the Minister, as one means of reducing rates, that he should change the system of paying road workers. If a worker from Mayo County Council, or any other county council, gets £4 5s. or £4 10s. per week regardless of whether he works or not, it is quite natural to assume that that man will say to himself that there is no point in trying to get over the job speedily or quickly. In mentioning speed and quickness, I would like at all times to see a good sound job. What I now suggest to the Minister I have, on previous occasions, suggested to the county surveyor. There may be a certain amount of difficulty in putting it into practice but I am convinced that if it were put into practice it would, at least, have the effect of getting greater mileage of road done. The suggestion is that all road workers or people engaged on road schemes, whether drivers of steamrollers, or ordinary labouring men, or anybody else, should get a substantial bonus on output.</P>
      <P>We have reached the time to-day when £4 10s. a week is, to my mind, a very poor wage for a working man. In order to make my case clear on that point, my idea would be something like this: when steamrolling a mile or two of road, give the worker on Saturday night his ordinary £4 10s. flat, and let him have that to pay for the ordinary necessaries of life; but in addition, give him a certain bonus if that job can be turned out in a certain length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances I am convinced <Col N="719" /> that our workers would be more willing to give greater output of work. Far be it from me to suggest any slave-labour system or anything of that kind. Our forefathers had to work far too hard in the past and I would not like to think that the present generation would have to work as hard as that, but I would like some incentive to be given to our road workers in order to increase output. That system has been adopted across the water in England, and I hate to copy anything that has been done in England, but at the same time they have long experience of road construction and they have greater experience of mechanisation than we have and they have adopted that system with beneficial results. It would, therefore, in my opinion be a good idea if we want to get over a great mileage of road, if we want to mop up miles and miles of road that still have to be undertaken for repairs, I think it would be an incentive to get workers to work harder and to get more co-operation from the workers if instead of having £4 10s. a week, they had £7 or £8 a week, and in my opinion it would be good business.</P>
    <P>If you apply that system to a business undertaking you find that a commercial representative working for a firm in Dublin or outside it leaves Dublin on a Monday morning to dispose of goods for his firm. He may be getting £7, £10 or £12 a week, but in almost all cases that particular representative has a commission on sales. Naturally, the incentive is provided there all along the line for that man once he leaves his office and goes into the first house of call to dispose of the stuff for his firm, because he has something to gain by it. It would mean that supervision on road workers could be, to a great extent, relaxed. It would mean that in many cases where you have a ganger and one or two men working, it could be avoided. There would be less need for supervision if the amount of work was measured out for them and you were to say: all right, you get £4 10s. a week plus bonus, when the job is finished, thus stepping up wages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> Rural Deputies have complained that the roads used by the farmer are sadly neglected. In Mayo we are proud of our engineering staff and of our workers, but we know that at the present rate, not even in my lifetime, and I may live to be a very old man, will these works be completed, because we are not getting on with the job quick enough. In many areas it is difficult to get contractors to undertake the work, because they do not consider the money allocated sufficient. These bad roads are one of the causes for the continued emigration of our farmers' sons and daughters. They know that the roads leading to the more important centres are in a good state of repair, nicely steamrolled and tarred, while they are condemned to haul turf and hay and farm produce over roads that are in a really deplorable condition. If the Minister does not make up his mind to be more generous with his grants for the upkeep of that type of road more and more will emigrate from these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask how it is suggested he can get over the difficulty. We have heard a great deal about the undeveloped areas. Mayo is scheduled as an undeveloped area. I suggest the Minister should make special grants available in the areas where the holdings are both small and uneconomic. More substantial sums of money should be allotted for the repair of these minor roads and that would be a good way of finding out where the really poor areas are. Every day of the week constituents are appealing to their representatives to have something done with such-and-such a road. I have tried travelling over these roads by car and invariably one finds that the underneath part of the car is caught by the road because they are sunken and smashed up. Deputy Beirne said to-night that it is the farmers who have damaged these roads. During the emergency period there was heavy lorry transport over them engaged in the haulage of turf and it is that traffic that has smashed up these roads, but the farmers are now expected to put these roads back into a proper state of repair out of local rates. Twenty and 30 years ago <Col N="721" /> these roads were in a much better condition than they are to-day.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to architects' fees. In our county we had the sad experience of being mulcted on a number of occasions. I am a member of the hospitals visiting committee. In the erection of the county hospital at Castlebar it has been admitted that the architects committed one of the greatest blunders they could have committed. No common sense person would have designed the storage facilities for medicines as they are designed in that hospital. Medicines and equipment in any hospital should occupy a central position. The contrary is the case in Castlebar. There, the medicines and equipment are stored in a most inconvenient place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell upon it at any great length. The question of architects' fees has been referred to and I merely wish to join my voice with that of the other Deputies who have spoken in criticism of the charges. When I first entered this House I addressed a question to the Minister in relation to the fees being charged. I got the impression then that I had revealed something to the Minister and that he was determined to bring about a reduction in these fees. I may have been wrong in that, but I appeal to him now to get in touch with these professional men and remind them that they cannot continue to charge these exorbitant fees. We will never succeed in housing our people and providing them with the necessary amenities if our architects continue to hold us up to ransom.</P>
      <P>To revert once more to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, if the Minister restores that scheme to its former level, the Irish farmers will be grateful to him. I appeal to him to restore the grants given formerly. The works done under that Act are essential to the well-being of the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>City Deputies have stressed the need for housing. I appeal to the Minister not to concentrate on <Col N="722" /> the cities and the towns but to build houses out in the country. There is no use in building houses in an already over-populated town. It may be right to build houses where there is some local industry capable of absorbing the local people in employment, but building houses where there is no potential employment merely means that the prospective inhabitants will not be able to meet the rents charged. I appeal to the Minister to build in the country because in the country there is always work for the man who is willing to do it.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the Local Authorities (Works) Act. I know that some good work was done under that Act but, on the other hand, a lot of bad work was done, too. Where a road is flooding there is no use in raising the level of the road and diverting that water on to the land. Surely no one could praise that kind of work. That Act was supposed to work in conjunction with the land reclamation scheme. That was not the way it worked in my particular area. We were anxious to have rivers drained but we were told we could not have that done because they were not flooding the roadways. I fail to see how it conferred any benefit on the agricultural community at all and I do not think the Minister is altogether to blame for the reduction in the grants. There had been a reduction in the grants under the previous Minister; I am sure he was contemplating the fact that this work could not last for ever.</P>
      <P>The problem of county roads is a burning question. Ours is an intensive agricultural area and we have traffic coming to the local beet factory from four or five counties. What can we do about that? When a recommendation is made for the repair or maintenance of a road, the county manager or the surveyor says: &ldquo;Give us the money and we will do the roads.&rdquo; The rates are far too high. If the repair of roads means an increase in rates the repair will never be carried out because the members of the local authority, no matter to what Party they belong, will contend that the rates have gone high enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Main roads are receiving very good <Col N="723" /> attention. That is essential in some cases. Nevertheless people have a grievance when they see money being spent on main roads which are in very good repair while county roads which are in a bad state of repair are neglected. A very good case was made by the Deputy who referred to the condition of roads that people have to travel on their way to Mass.</P>
    <P>The roads were not built to carry modern traffic. In many cases they are not wide enough. A week ago I was held up for half an hour on a main road because of a hold-up caused by a lorry and a bus being unable to pass. People look to the local authority for something to be done.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to build houses in rural areas. Deputy Byrne referred to the provision of houses for newly-weds in Dublin. There are cases in the area that I represent of married people having to live with their parents because they could not get a cottage. These people deserve houses. They are good workers. Overcrowding is wrong. I would ask the Minister to increase the grants for county roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In taking part in this debate I feel rather embarrassed inasmuch as I must refer to many matters that have been mentioned already. I shall try to be as brief, as precise and as constructive as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the condition of the roads has been debated at length but more remains to be said. We must bear in mind that the roads were not built for the traffic that is now moving over them. We have had a native Government for only 30 years. During that period we have experienced an emergency as a result of which the roads suffered grievously. Millions of pounds have been spent on the roads and millions more must be spent before we can cater for modern traffic. Five and ten ton lorries and sometimes lorries and trailers of 20 tons use the roads. I believe that C.I.E. are the greatest offenders in this matter. The traffic which they are rolling over the roads should properly be carried over the railways. In putting that traffic <Col N="724" /> on the roads, C.I.E. are ridding themselves of responsibility to a certain extent for maintenance of the railways and shifting that responsibility on to the Department of Local Government and the ratepayers who maintain the roads. I should like the Minister to bear that matter in mind. I should like the officials of the Department of Local Government who are listening to me here to-night to bear that in mind and not allow that burden to be shifted from C.I.E. and placed on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy and every member of a public body must be very proud of the progress that has been achieved over the past 30 years in housing our people. Much has been done. Much more remains to be done. I would ask the Minister, in connection with any future scheme of housing for rural towns and villages, to build houses of a type that will be within the capacity of the tenant to pay for. In larger towns and cities there is always some prospect of work, whether it be great or small. In rural areas that prospect is remote and was never less rosy than it is at present. Therefore, I would recommend in the building of houses that it will be within the capacity of the tenants to pay for them. A housing scheme has been completed in a certain area. Tenants have been moved into some of the houses. I regret to say that the rents which are being imposed on the people have meant that the head of the family has to go to England to earn the rent and the comforts which his family are enjoying in the new home and which, unfortunately, he cannot for the present enjoy with them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter and I think it is the most important matter of all inasmuch as I think it is a grievous sin against the ratepayers of this country. It is a recurring sin, one which has been handed down the years, so much so that it could be rightly styled now as a hardy annual. That is the question of where public bodies, county councils, in order to carry on the social services of their respective counties, have to go into the banks, raise overdrafts and pay interest on those overdrafts awaiting the payment to them of the grants <Col N="725" /> allocated to them by the Local Government Department. I have been a member of Clare County Council for 19 years, and the estimate which came up before us for the striking of the rate this year included, mind you, no less than £14,000 interest. I stand up here in this House to-night; officials of the Department are listening to me, and the Minister is listening to me; and I can safely say that I know what I am talking about when I say that between £9,000 and £10,000 of it was interest paid on overdrafts awaiting the grants which were due to us by the Department. I would ask the Minister to take particular note of that, because to my mind that is one item of rates which the ratepayer has to pay and for which he gets nothing. I would say here that if he has to pay it at all, would it not be a grand thing to pay that £9,000 for the installation of a water scheme or a sewerage scheme in some little village in County Clare?</P>
    <P>Those are the points, which I believe are constructive points, which I put before the Minister, and I am asking him to take particular note of them since he is the Minister of the Department at present. I am asking him, above all, that one thing will not happen, that the ratepayers of the country will not be asked, through lack of co-operation between the public bodies and the Department, to pay in rates of interest money for which they get nothing in return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The second serious problem which we have in this country, in my opinion, is the flight from the land and, unfortunately, we are making no serious effort to stem it. I think that, in some way, the Department of Local Government are to blame. It may be that in certain parts of this country we may not have sufficient employment to retain our people in rural Ireland, but there are other parts, particularly in the farming communities, where there is employment, and where farmers cannot obtain the farm labourers they require. Some of us who have had the privilege of travelling on the Continent may have noticed that all over France, in particular, the labouring classes of the farming community live in villages, and in those <Col N="726" /> villages they have the social amenities of town and city life. I am convinced that until we build villages instead of isolated labourers' cottages for our farm workers we will not induce them to remain at home on the land. I would like to see the Town Planning Act put into force in such a way that we would compel local authorities, and even farmers, to build their houses for the workers in small communities. I would like to see, further, town and city amenities given to those small communities by way of parochial halls and, if necessary, picture houses, and grants given by the Department to subsidise the initial building of these places of entertainment. Until something is done in that way, I do not think we are going to entice our farm labourers to remain in the country. It is something which deserves serious consideration, in my view. Otherwise, in a very few years, we will have no person left to do the requirements of the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter about which I would like to criticise not this Minister or his predecessor is this question which has grown up in recent years in the Department of Local Government of what has been described to-day already as red tape. There is no doubt whatsoever that the efforts of people who are anxious to partake of the various grant schemes and other advantages which they may partake of from the Local Government Department are being frustrated by red tape. I and some of my colleagues in this House who are solicitors know the difficulties which small farmers, labourers and others experience in trying to perfect title to their property before they can qualify for grants or loans under the various Housing Acts. I think a serious effort should be made by the Department to simplify the investigation of title and if necessary to introduce legislation for that purpose. I might suggest a simple inhibition prohibiting the owner of a dwelling who has secured a loan from parting with or pledging that holding or that dwelling pending repayment of advances made. I am sure that it is not beyond the powers of the legal officers of the Department to draft such legislation. I do know of applicants for loans from local authorities who have <Col N="727" /> to wait as long as six or eight months while equities are being discharged on holdings pending the issue of grants and loans. I really think that the Minister and the Department should get down to it and grapple with this question and introduce some simple method whereby applicants may partake of these loans in a cheap expeditious manner. I also think that the town dweller and the farm labourer should have grants for the laying on of water such as are given to small farmers. I know a number of people in my constituency who are only anxious to take advantage of public water supplies to have water laid on to their holdings, but, unfortunately, there is at the moment no scheme whereby they can obtain a grant for that purpose, whereas their neighbour who may have a small farm of five or six acres will get a grant of approximately £1 per yard for the laying on of water. Water is an essential amenity for every household, and grants should be provided for the laying on of water in all dwellings.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would refer, and that is grants which were made available some time last year to local authorities for the development of tourist roads in tourist localities. I understand that the scheme whereby those grants were administered was something like this: the local authority was asked to submit certain schemes to the Department, the Department approved of the scheme or otherwise, and eventually the scheme was commenced. I cannot understand why all this red tape, again, should occur in tying up moneys made available to local authorities such as this. County managers, members of county councils and county engineers are reasonable men. They are not going to throw money away. They are not going to throw away the taxpayers' money. If we are going to make certain moneys available to local authorities for the development of tourist amenities in certain counties, surely to goodness we can depend on the local authorities and on their officials to administer these moneys and expend them properly. Certain allocations should be made to <Col N="728" /> each county council and the county council should be allowed to administer the funds made available to them. In that way we would have none of this overlapping by different sections of the Department, particularly the engineering branch. This also applies to many other schemes administered by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I think we should have confidence in our local authorities. If we are going to give them money let them expend it and be responsible for expending it. We know of schemes in Donegal suggested by the local county manager and county council to the Department for the expenditure of public funds. These schemes were examined in the Department of Local Government. Many of them were turned down and other schemes not recommended by the local county council substituted for them. No person knows better than the members of the local authority what is best and most required in an area. I think we should have more confidence in them and give them the opportunity of expending these moneys which the Oireachtas votes to them for expenditure on these matters.</P>
    <P>I should like also to appeal to the Minister to reconsider the question of motor taxation. I understand his Department is responsible for the collection of it. We have not got in rural Ireland a public service which possibly the towns and cities have got. We depend a lot on the hackney car, but as a result of recent taxation the larger hackney car is being driven off the road. I know decent men who were trying to eke out an existence as hackney car owners. They had to sell their cars and migrate to Scotland as a result of the increase in taxation and the increase in petrol duties. The Minister may have nothing whatsoever to do with the taxation on motor fuel but he has certainly something to do with the taxation on these cars. I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this question of taxation and see if something could not be done to relieve the burden placed on hackney owners until such time as we have public transport services all over rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand that in or about 1939 a <Col N="729" /> Bill was introduced in this House to have dwellings and agricultural holdings of the country revalued. I understand that Bill got a Second Reading in this House by a majority. It has never been seen or heard of since but a much more subtle method of increasing valuation has been introduced. Without any apparent reason whatsoever, the poor law valuation of holdings and dwellings all over the country has been increased by almost 100 per cent. in many cases. Not so very long ago the Taoiseach told this House that we had reached the limit of taxation, but to get round that the Department of Local Government found the subtle method of increasing poor law valuation. No later than this morning I was consulted by a ratepayer in the town of Donegal whose poor law valuation originally was £30. He carried out no repairs, no renovations and no extension to his premises for the past 50 years other than an application of paint, but within the past six months his poor law valuation was increased from £30 to £60 for no apparent reason whatsoever.</P>

Let me conclude by appealing to the Minister to grapple with this question of red tape.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I want to call the Minister's attention to the fact that the Westmeath County Council sent up details of a purchase scheme for 200 labourers' cottages 12 months ago. From that day to this we have not heard a word about it. The tenants in respect of these cottages are writing to me day after day asking me when the cottages would be available for purchase. I would ask the Minister to treat that matter urgently.</P>
      <P>A young labourer, whose father resides in my parish, went to England two years ago. He came home last August and got married but he had no house in which to live. This young married man put in for a labourer's cottage. The owner of the land was quite willing to give him the cottage. He got a letter from the Westmeath County Council saying that because he was living in England the council could not build a house for him. Is that the policy of the present Government? No wonder our young boys and girls will not come home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to protest strongly against the managerial system. I was all out for it one time but I have come to the conclusion that unless county councillors get back more power it will come to the time when ratepayers will not be able to pay the rates. All county councils are becoming semi-Government offices. The country cannot afford that and we are heading for disaster unless there is some immediate change made in the managerial system. <Col N="731" /> County councils have no power whatsoever. All we see is the orders of the manager and we never hear another word about them. We have no power whatsoever. I would appeal to the Minister for the good of the country to do away with the managerial system and ensure that the local authorities will have more say in their affairs. The fact that the rates have reached such a pitch is due in my opinion to the managerial system and to the fact that we are trying to imitate semi-Government offices in every county in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As is usual in regard to the Estimate for Local Government, I can truly say that this debate has taken its weary way. This must be the sixth day of the discussion. I hope I will not be expected to reply to all the points made by different Deputies on every conceivable aspect of local government and on some matters that have no relation whatever to local government. I intend to deal with the matters as I dealt with them in my opening statement when introducing the Estimate some days ago.</P>
      <P>One subject on which we have heard quite a lot in the course of this discussion is the subject of housing. In my opening statement I gave certain figures of needs which were compiled in 1947 and against which the whole effort of the Department of Local Government and local bodies everywhere had been directed since. These figures were treated by some of the members who have spoken on this Estimate as if I regarded them in every case as complete and accurate now in 1953. Of course, I made no such claim in regard to these figures, and if I used them at all it was in order that we would keep in mind what the objective then was and the distance which the different local bodies had gone to meet it. These figures were misrepresented, too, by some of the earlier speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the survey in 1947 the needs established for local authority housing were 70,000, and it was estimated <Col N="732" /> that there was also need for private houses to the extent of about 40,000, which in all would mean approximately 110,000. I then proceeded to give figures to show what had been achieved since then so that the House and the country would have an idea of the extent to which we had made a dent in our requirements. I did not put forward these figures in any boastful way when I said that up to date 32,000 houses had been completed by local bodies of the 70,000 which were found in 1947 to be required, that 10,000 were in tender and that 10,000 sites had been procured. It was suggested that it was not fair to include the 10,000 sites inasmuch as the ordinary preliminary processes might only be going on in regard to them, and that it might be a considerable time before any question of issuing these for tender would arise. I was not supplying these figures with the intention of misleading anybody or making any bogus claim as to the progress that had been made.</P>
    <P>I am not going to accuse Deputy Keyes&mdash;because it would not be right on the evidence I have before me&mdash;of an unfair analysis of the figures for house building over the past three years, but he certainly made one mistake in regard to the figures which it is hard to account for. For example, for 1950-51 he grouped the figures for local bodies and private builders and they amounted to 12,118, but after 1951-52 he gave only the figures for local bodies excluding what had been done by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Although many speakers here have been stating repeatedly that the housing effort has declined, the figures I have before me do not bear that out and there is no foundation or justification for such statements. It must be remembered that factors and circumstances can arise with any local body that will throw their effort out of gear. For instance, if the Dublin Corporation aim at providing, say, 2,500 houses as their normal output and try to exceed it if they can, something may arise which will prevent them from achieving that objective. If the responsible Minister then comes forward and the figures have fallen he may be blamed for a result <Col N="733" /> for which in fact neither he nor anybody else could be, in fairness, held responsible. Taking local authority and private builders the figure for 1950-51 is 12,118, for 1951-52, 12,116 and for 1952-53, 13,291.</P>
    <P>Emphasis was laid on the fact that there was some unemployment in the building industry, but the speakers here failed to remember, as far as I can gather, that the building of houses represents in the normal way about one-third of the employment that is given in the building industry. You have commercial buildings of all kinds, you have churches, schools and all sorts of public buildings. It might come as a surprise that that type of enterprise should be responsible for two-thirds of the employment that is provided by the building industry as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>All house building represents one half of the total building and all the other types I have mentioned represents two-thirds. I made a reply to a parliamentary question some time ago in regard to the number of bodies that had completed schemes. I think they are 50 in all; as far as I can remember there were six county councils among these. Some Deputies may suggest that these local authorities have not in fact completed their housing task at all, but how is my Department to know unless as a result of the public opinion that arises. If a family happens to be without a house surely they will make their wants known through the ordinary channels. If any of these local bodies, as a result of the pressure arising in that way, think there is a need for further housing, surely there is no impediment in their way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested here also that the completion by local bodies of their task resulted in skilled labour being released so that it could be concentrated in the larger areas. As <Col N="734" /> Deputies know, the real housing problem is in Dublin&mdash;and, to a much lesser extent, in Cork. It is true that, as the smaller local bodies complete their task, skilled and other labour may become available for a concentrated effort on larger areas; but at the same time there is only a limited amount of work that larger bodies, such as Dublin Corporation, can do in any one year.</P>
    <P>I have listened over a period of 25 or 30 years to discussions on this Estimate here and I have listened to members of the corporation who over a long period of years have taken a great interest in housing work in Dublin. I also know now in a more intimate way the problems that confront a large local body such as the Dublin Corporation. However anxious to proceed they may be, they have to provide various services &mdash;water, sewerage, light, roads, electricity, open spaces and playing spaces&mdash; before they can proceed. As some Dublin Deputies said during this debate, the further you go out from the centre of the city the greater the problem in providing those services. It is not easy to imagine the tremendous organisation required to provide all these services in advance of the housing effort. I state these facts roughly, in order to show that the availability of unlimited labour would not in itself mean that the housing problem in Dublin City could be solved, say, in four years instead of eight years. One may be able to speed up, but not to the extent of absorbing an unlimited amount of that type of labour.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies&mdash;not only those representing Dublin but from other parts also&mdash;suggested that the Minister and the Department were responsible for the existence of derelict buildings and the failure of some local bodies to clear derelict sites. I did not think there would be any doubt in the mind of any Deputy&mdash;especially any member of Dublin Corporation&mdash;on that matter. I wholeheartedly believe in a policy of clearing derelict sites. My Department has made its view known officially to the Dublin Corporation and has made its view known verbally to the city and county manager. We <Col N="735" /> believe&mdash;as Deputies who have spoken believe&mdash;that the corporation should tackle the problem and use those sites for whatever purposes&mdash;especially for housing and the provision of flats&mdash; they may decide, on the advice of the officials who serve them. Let there be no doubt about our attitude regarding the derelict sites in Dublin City.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I was going to turn my attention to other cities and towns. In the course of my meetings with members of local bodies, I have found that, especially in the smaller towns, many of these derelict sites are not of the type you would select freely for the provision of houses. Very often they are in the centre of the town and, if allowed to remain, they are an eyesore for all time. There are also those who say, for example&mdash;and I sympathise with the point of view, but while it is easy to see a point of view it is not always easy to act in accordance with it&mdash;that it is a pity that, when inaugurating a small housing scheme in a town, you have to remove the people away from their places of business to another place outside the town. They say it interferes with the trade of the town and with the living of individuals. There is no means by which you can readily deal with that. You must first remove the people from the undesirable buildings, then clear the buildings and, when you have the families rehoused, try to make the best use of the sites left for further housing purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are side issues: I am talking only in general terms. I found myself confronted in a few cases with this situation: a local authority proposed to clear some houses in a small place, where there were no back yards or back gardens&mdash;or only small ones. An architect looking at such sites is prone to reject them, as he has not the spaciousness which gives him liberty to do the sort of job he thinks he should do. One can sympathise with the architect's point <Col N="736" /> of view, but there is a practical side as well as an architectural side. I told the members of local authorities who said that some of our architects were unwilling to approve of sites of that description, that they should not take the refusal as final in all cases.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made here of the undesirability of red tape and it was asked why it is necessary not to allow a local body to go ahead. There is quite a considerable amount of public money involved in this effort. Sometimes we hear the complaint that red tape is a cause of obstruction to the work; yet if anything goes wrong, if the job is an unsatisfactory one, we hear a different argument completely. For example, during the course of this debate, we heard about schemes of houses that were provided without a back door. While I do not agree that there should be unnecessary interference, I feel that a certain amount of it is necessary.</P>
      <P>As a matter of general policy, my Department and I are in favour of the clearance of derelict sites everywhere. I was surprised that that approach was not pressed forward more energetically. I am sure that there are difficulties and obstacles. For example, some time ago a proposal was put before me in respect of the provision of flats in a certain area in Dublin that had been cleared. The tender seemed to me to be very high compared with the cost of ordinary housing. At the same time, I realised the advantage of housing our people as near as possible to the place where they grew up. Therefore, I approved of the tender although I must say that I felt it was excessive.</P>
      <P>That action revealed my whole outlook on that particular problem. If, then, any local body have been discouraged in regard to a particular site &mdash;they have not been discouraged with the principle of this work&mdash;because of its layout and the limited amount of space available, they should raise the matter again with us and we shall try to remove as much of the red tape as we justifiably can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sorts of suggestions have been made about housing in rural parts. The last speaker mentioned the desirability <Col N="737" /> of building a group of cottages. I think that somebody mentioned the same matter to me when I was down the country yesterday. To some extent, I dealt with it, but my effort to make my mind and my attitude known in regard to this proposal was not very accurately reported. There is a lot to be said for and against it. Undoubtedly, if you can do what is done in other parts of the world&mdash;if you can get your people into villages&mdash;you can certainly provide amenities for them which, in fact, it would be impossible to provide if the houses were scattered. Whether I am right or whether I am wrong, I feel that most of our people who have been accustomed to living in rural parts and who intend to continue their lives in rural parts, want a continuation of that privacy which is associated with living in a house that is out on its own and not too near other houses in preference to the amenities that could be provided if they were placed in little groups in villages. If you consider the arguments for and against, you will come to the conclusion that, in a rural area, a man who is looking for work is more likely to get it if he is living in an isolated cottage. These are my views. The question then is: Which are you going to favour? In one county which I visited I was surprised that the local authority&mdash;with, I think, the encouragement of some of my officials&mdash; favoured the grouping of these houses in villages. I could not see what prospects of employment there were in some of these villages for some of the families that had been brought in from a mile or two miles outside the village.</P>
    <P>If I were called upon to decide that issue, my prejudice would be in favour of distributing these houses in rural areas for the reasons which I have already set out. I think I know the two sides and I think the balance in many cases is in favour of the distribution of these houses. All that goes to show that there are many people who have the other approach and who can make a good case for it. Sometimes the Department are accused of red tape when, in fact, the position is that two points of view are put forward strongly&mdash;two points of view which <Col N="738" /> have to be carefully considered before coming to a decision. It will be seen, therefore, that it is not a matter of red tape at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton mentioned a circular issued by my Department in regard to the building of private houses. I think that matter was also raised with me some time before the introduction of this Estimate. I should not like to think that the issue of that circular would in any way retard building progress. I should like the Deputy and those who are interested to remember that in the past we have received quite a number of complaints from the purchasers of houses who, shortly after coming into possession of them, became dissatisfied. When we say we have no responsibility for the house or its condition, these people remind us that we paid a State grant in respect of it and that, before the State grant was paid, the house was inspected by an inspector from the Department. These people regard the certificate which enables payment to be made to carry with it a certificate of satisfactory workmanship in every respect. Apart from that, we are anxious to raise the standard of speculative building. We believe, whether rightly or wrongly, that the circular should not have any detrimental effect on the provision of such houses. With regard to the provision of a house by an individual himself, partly by his own labour and supervised by himself, the circular clearly conveys to appointed officers that, in such cases, there is to be no question of insistence on that standard. I am talking now of a house which is erected, say, by a farmer or a labourer or any other type of individual on a site which he has procured for himself and on which he will do a certain amount of the unskilled work in an effort to reduce the costs.</P>
    <P>If the circular which has been issued to the appointed officers has been misunderstood or misinterpreted by them, I should like to make it clear that, in so far as houses for individuals who supervise their erection, who employ skilled labour and do any of the unskilled work themselves in an effort to keep down costs are concerned, <Col N="739" /> there will certainly be no insistence on the conditions set out there. We feel that it is necessary for us to do our best to raise the standard of the houses being provided by the builder and sold to the individual and this sometimes results in this sort of charge being made against us and the sort of complaint to which I have referred, if a house is found to have any defects.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies complained, too, about the payment of grants in respect of private housing throughout the country. It is not easy, no matter how you try, to keep in an advanced condition, inspections, payments and so on. You will find that, in certain counties, from time to time, arrears will mount up which can only be dealt with by the sending of some assistance to the permanent inspector in the area. I admit that, no matter how you try to eliminate them, these delays will arise, but we certainly do our best to ensure that they will not arise. Sometimes they come about in this way, that the person who has finished a job or who is, perhaps, applying for the first instalment of the grant, instead of writing to the Department, writes to the local inspector. We have no record of the fact that he has done so and no record of the fact that the house has reached the stage it has reached, and, therefore, we do not know the volume of work which is available for inspection. I advise, therefore, that in all these cases of people building houses for themselves, they should notify us immediately they are ready for the first instalment and the same applies where they have completed the job and are applying for the final instalment. I am not saying that, no matter what they do or we do, there will not be some delays, but we undoubtedly make every effort to help people in this regard, because any man can understand that many of these people who have very limited means, if they provide houses for themselves, cannot very well afford to be left very long without the grant.</P>

      <P>I could not express any opinion on that, but I am sometimes surprised by the speed with which it can be done. At other times, you would be astounded by the time it takes. The human element is always there to be reckoned and, in certain cases, the individual, the Department and the inspector may not be free from blame, but I must say that in many cases, where a man who builds a house for himself goes properly about notifying the fact that the roof is on and applying for the first instalment, or the fact that he has completed the erection, and does it clearly, the delay is never too long. It is only where he notifies the inspector that delay occurs. Sometimes he will not make provision for the inspector to enter the house when he comes and will not be at home himself and if the inspector gets one disappointment, it is not easy to get him back. There are all kinds of little problems like that which cause irritation and delay, but my experience is that, where an applicant makes a fair effort to proceed along the lines I have roughly indicated, there is never too much delay. I never did ask myself what is a fair average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see, even at first glance, how that would fit into an ordered system of the provision of houses, so far as local bodies are concerned. I know that, in the course of a discussion like this, all kinds of suggestions will be made by Deputies about slowing down this and slowing down that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, so far as we are concerned, we are anxious to get on with this work as quickly as we can and anxious to help, within reason, every local body which is tackling these problems seriously. Some Deputies threw bouquets at the Department because of the co-operation they had got, but that does not arise. The work is there to be done and it is our duty to help. If a local body finds itself in a difficulty which is capable of a solution, without outraging what is fair and reasonable, we will not stand in the way. That is all we can say or do.</P>
      <P>So far as the provision of houses by all the local bodies is concerned, it is up to the members of these bodies to see to it that, if a new survey is required&mdash;those of them that have reached the 1947 figures of requirements&mdash;the new survey is made, and, if there is need for further houses, any proposals they have to make will be considered, just as the proposals made by them in the past have been considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a lot of this work is necessary. I wonder is the word &ldquo;lost&rdquo; the right word. These things take time and it is hard to provide things, as substantial as houses, which are very desirable and necessary, without the expenditure of some things, of which time is one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the points which was raised and on which a good deal was said is this question of roads. Some people seem to think that I personally have some terrific fad for roads. I used to be quite the opposite, but, with the passage of time and in the changing <Col N="742" /> circumstances, I do not think there is any alternative to our considering this matter and realising its importance. The whole attitude of our people in the country in regard to roads has changed. When I was a member of a county council&mdash;it is only 14 or 15 years ago&mdash; we had a deputation from the farmers every two or three months protesting against the tarring of roads.</P>
    <P>They claimed that this work made it impossible for them to move their animals on these highways at all. In certain counties they succeeded in getting strips provided on the side of the road so as to enable them to bring their animals with safety along these highways. Some of the most heated discussions on this question took place only a few years back and yet, to-day, if you go into the most remote district and meet any group of rural people, you will find that the one thing they are clamouring for is improved roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The old horses have gone off the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the cause of it is, we cannot help it. Of course they complain, as Deputies have been complaining, that in spite of the increased provision made for roads, the moneys are not reaching the roads that serve them, the roads that they use most and that are nearest to many of their homes. Deputies in this discussion have given expression to some resentment because all the provision made for main roads and also for county roads, was not being applied to roads which served the bulk of these people. I do not know more than I see myself of what is happening and what is being done by engineers in the areas I know best and what they appear to be aiming at to meet the new set of conditions with the moneys that are being made available to them. I can only say that they seem to be following a policy or trying to make well-surfaced connections as between the main towns and the main points in the counties for which these engineering gentlemen have responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies know that in present circumstances the repair of a road is different from what it was 15 years <Col N="743" /> ago and unfortunately, the fact of having a few men going round filling pot-holes, even on remote byroads, will not give the best results, because when a fast moving vehicle comes along it scatters the stones to the side of the road and most of the effort is lost. Unfortunately it is hard to say when some of these roads can be reached in many counties so as to give them the surface that we would like them to have.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have mentioned the fact that a considerable amount of money was being spent on the main roads. I sometimes see certain work being done on the main roads about which I have some doubt myself, but that is not a doubt held sufficiently strongly to warrant my taking a decision that would reverse that policy. After all, if we take the roads leading from Dublin, there is a tremendous amount of traffic going to every part of the country, but if you compare the approaches to Dublin with the approaches, say, to Belfast, they just cannot stand up to the comparison at all. I would not be one bit anxious to provide highways to suit fast motor traffic, but we have to face up to the fact that some of the old main roads that were reconditioned, as Deputy Allen pointed out, are cracking up, breaking and sagging and there is not the slightest possibility that the traffic on these roads is likely to ease. In fact, we can make up our minds that the traffic will grow heavier. So that while there is, to an ever-increasing extent, a big investment in the main roads, it is the duty of local bodies, not only to protect that investment but to make sure that the roads are improved to the point that will enable them to carry the increasing traffic that is daily coming on to them.</P>
    <P>The provision that has been made for county roads improvements is well in excess of that of former years. It is not true to say that we have been neglectful of county roads. The provision is very substantial but it is still not sufficient to enable us to say that within a short period most of our backward county roads will be properly surfaced. All we can do is to do our best and make the best use of the <Col N="744" /> money that is being provided. There are different points of view in regard to this question. Some Deputies have suggested that much of the money that was being provided was being burned up in machinery.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Dunne who said that the question of whether machinery should be utilised to the extent that it is being used, was a burning question. There are others who maintain that the whole matter of road-making should be treated on a different basis. Again, you have to think in terms of what the local body will be likely to approve of. In introducing whatever modern methods are being used now, I am quite sure that intelligent local bodies discussed the matter from the point of view of all the implications, in regard to employment and otherwise, that their decisions might have. It is not that the provision of first-class roads is a fad with me. I know, as I think I have demonstrated, that the attitude of the people in the country, even of the farmers and of people in remote districts, has completely changed on this matter. They are more inclined now to look to what is required for the future. It appears to me there is no way of getting out of that.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when I see very expensive work being carried out on the corners of main roads and country roads I have discussions with the engineers in my Department as to the wisdom of engaging in this work, having regard to the cost. There are some cases where you go away with the feeling that the results would hardly justify the effort and the expenditure. On the other hand, I see work being done now between my own county and Dublin on the same corners on roads that were dealt with 25 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is slow progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear to get the point I am making. These corners were dealt with 25 years ago. Certain easements were effected and certain land was acquired, and certain improvements carried out. With the passage of time and the changing circumstances and the volume of traffic, the local bodies who did <Col N="745" /> this work 25 years ago have to acquire further land and make further improvements. I sometimes find myself in doubt, I admit, as to whether some of this work is justifiable. The only thing which reassures me is that I saw work of that kind being carried out in the same place 25 years ago, and that now it is necessary to spend further money. If the engineers responsible then had the vision to see what was coming, it would not be necessary, perhaps, to spend what is being spent now.</P>
      <P>That also goes for the acquisition of land. When they proceed to acquire land for the easement of corners or bends like that, the suggestion is made that they are taking too much land. Again, I suppose they are. But if on a previous occasion they had taken more land they could have carried out the further improvements without the efforts that have now to be made. They may say to themselves: &ldquo;What we are doing now is not perfect and, for the sake of a few extra yards, we will ensure that our successors will not be held up as we have been.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am only trying to see what is running through the minds of those who are responsible for this work. In a general way I am trying to show that road work is important because we are facing a new situation altogether. No matter what we may say or do, we cannot keep control of the extent to which vehicles will be used on the roads and the extent to which general merchandise will be carried over them, and I think it is our duty in a progressive way to try to improve our roads so as to be able to handle these problems as they come along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made during the course of the discussion about the traffic situation in the City of Dublin. I am not a city man, and I suppose I do not know the problems that arise as a result of the congestion of traffic here as well as those who have a more intimate knowledge of them than I have. However, from passing through some of the worst of this traffic a couple of times a week, I am well aware that something will have to be done to try to ease it. Just as in the case of our roads, the streets were constructed at <Col N="746" /> a time when those responsible did not visualise what they would be called upon to carry. Of course, in order to ease that situation in certain places it would be necessary for the corporation to remove certain buildings and take all the necessary steps to widen those rights of way at many points. That would, of course, require the provision of bridges over the Liffey, and all I will say on that subject is, that if the responsible bridge authorities in Dublin as a result of discussions come to some agreement as to a reasonable solution for that matter, I have been authorised by the Government to say that I will be prepared to make available to such authorities 75 per cent. of the cost of any bridge they may decide to erect at reasonable expense.</P>

However, I am reminded by the secretary of my Department that I did promise that a similar grant would, under certain circumstances, be given in the case of Youghal bridge also.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies mentioned the question of the Athlone bridge and spoke of the undesirability of erecting a fixed bridge there. That bridge has been a fixed bridge, in fact, since 1937 and at the inquiry there did not seem to be any considerable local feeling or demand that an open-span bridge should be erected. It came to me as a sort of surprise that the matter should be taken up with such heat. If there is a case to be made, however, it can be considered. But, having regard to the tremendous difference in cost between a fixed bridge and an open-span bridge, there would certainly have to be justification established before you could give <Col N="747" /> the necessary sanction to undertaking that work.</P>
      <P>The next matter that Deputies referred to at great length was the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the smallness of the provision made in the Estimate for work under that Act. A good deal of opinion of one kind or another has been expressed regarding the type of work that was done under that Act. Some allegations were made here&mdash;I do not mind them being made&mdash;as to the motive and the reasons for this steady reduction, as they put it, in this particular Vote. All kinds of motives were attributed to the Minister because of that happening.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted right away that even if all the work that was done as a result of the money that was spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act had all given good results, which I doubt, the very fact that there was no maintenance provision surely suggests that we should be careful. After all, in the course of this discussion, Deputies have been speaking about the height of national taxation and the extent of local taxation. I admit that, in the early years, a very large provision was made from grant moneys, but that was made at a time when the road grants had been substantially reduced.</P>
      <P>If Deputies want to, they can make any charge they like, but I am not saying these things for the purpose of advancing a political argument or giving a reason that is a justification of myself or of anybody else; but I do say that the amount that was provided by my predecessor the following year was an indication that those who introduced the Bill, which subsequently became an Act, did so on the understanding that there was a certain volume of work of this type to be done, and that as this work was done &mdash;as these roads and drains were relieved&mdash;the money provision would not necessarily have to be continued at the same level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, I thought of the possibility of trying to get some understanding with local bodies as to the maintenance of works that had been improved as a result of the expenditure <Col N="748" /> of these moneys. The Act itself was a permissive Act, and did not deal with the amount of any grant that would be made payable to local bodies for work undertaken under the Act. If I were to give effect to the thoughts that were in my mind it might be necessary to have legislation along these lines.</P>
    <P>Certain county councils did suggest to me that something should be done. They appreciated the things that I have appreciated for years, namely, that if the work that was done was not maintained, and if the councils were not going to look after it, in three, four or five years any effects that were felt as a result of the expenditure would be lost. Having regard to the accusations which have been made here as to the extent that local rates have increased&mdash;and all of us know that they have&mdash;one could not look forward with pleasure to the introduction of proposals that would contain a provision to the effect that the local body would have to approach the Local Authorities (Works) Act on the basis of making a contribution in respect of any work undertaken.</P>
    <P>No matter what charges are levelled against myself, I believe that if local bodies were making some contribution, either to the actual carrying out of a work or to its maintenance thereafter, it is only on that basis you would get real results. In my own experience, I could see, as regards work done recently, that as the smaller rivers and streams had been cleaned, the councils were being forced into the wider and more formidable rivers, that they were in fact employing dredgers, and that the prospects of giving any considerable amount of labour were gradually fading away.</P>
    <P>I have discussed all these matters with the engineers who had the responsibility of spending this money, and, in most cases, they agreed that they were not equipped in many ways to ensure the sort of inspection and supervision that was necessary: that, as regards all the work that is associated with drainage, they were not properly equipped to do it and at the same time look after the work for which they <Col N="749" /> are in the main responsible. After all, if we talk, as we do, about the increase in the rates and about the increase in national taxation, surely a member of the Government has to think, too, of the other results that are being secured. We had the experience in this country in 1924 of an Act which was more or less designed on similar lines.</P>
    <P>We saw that it had been operated for 12 months on a more or less piecemeal basis. We saw an amending Act introduced in 1925 as a result, I take it, of the experience that had been gained from the working of the earlier measure. After these two Acts had been in operation for quite some time, we saw that a commission was established to examine the results. As far as I am concerned, I read every line of the evidence that was tendered by all the county councils to that commission, with the exception of the Cork County Council which, apparently, was so disinterested in drainage that it did not take any part or give any co-operation at all; but the whole consensus of opinion that was tendered to that commission, the advice that was tendered and the criticism that was offered by all the county councils, through their county engineers, was that that form of approach to drainage would not give permanent results, and that in many cases, while it was relieving a problem in one particular district, it very often resulted in transferring the problem to another district.</P>
    <P>I am no expert on these matters, but I know that my own county is as wet as any other, and that we suffer as much from flooding as any other county. I certainly can say it has been my experience that the carrying out of the drainage in that spasmodic way did result in transferring water from place to place; that, while relieving one particular area it very often has resulted in creating hardship in another&mdash;that is, as I say, unless and until the main arteries in the country are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I think myself that, if we can make a reasonable provision that will be available to local bodies to deal with the little problems that arise, we are <Col N="750" /> doing what is right. If it were not for the fact that local rates are going up so steeply, I would like to see the local bodies making some contribution.</P>
    <P>Whether that is popular or whether it is not, if they were either making some contribution to the execution of whatever works were undertaken under this Act, or to the maintenance of the works when completed, I certainly think that so far as long-distance results are concerned you would get them more securely by such means. I do not know what other people may think, but I believe it is the duty of those who from time to time have the responsibility of Ministers to see that if money is to be expended, whether grant money or money out of taxation, and while we would all like to see the fallow land of the country relieved of flooding and brought into production, we must ask ourselves the questions that I have posed here and we must answer, and we must try to get the best value we can not only for the landowner but also for the taxpayers who have to be approached so as to provide ways and means of doing that work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be taken separately. One of the principal criticisms levelled by the Opposition Parties to the administration of the Department of Finance during the last year is that quite deliberately the Government, through the Central Bank, gives cheap money to England and demands a dear price from Irish institutions and local authorities for money lent for development purposes.</P>
      <P>On the 24th October, Deputy Dillon went down to Ballybay and he said there: &ldquo;Mr. MacEntee continues to pay 4¾ or 5 per cent. for the money he borrows while he lends over £60,000,000 to the British Government at about 1½ per cent.. All this seems daft to me.&rdquo; When he made that statement he was following the line that Deputy MacBride took in Ballybay a week or two before that. Deputy MacBride repeated in Ballybay an allegation that he has made here and elsewhere on several occasions, namely, that we are giving our money through the Central Bank for little or no rate of interest to the British, and that we are robbing our own people by charging them 5 per cent. or 5½ per cent.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy MacBride and Deputy Dillon were merely following the line taken by Deputy McGilligan. Deputy McGilligan on 26th November, 1952, at columns 115 and 116 of the Official Report said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has had to pay 5 per cent. to get people to lend him money and when the local loans go out the people who take them will be paying 5½, 5¾ or 6 per cent. Yet we have lent £54,000,000 in 1951 and nearly £59,000,000 in 1952 to England, while the Central Bank which is empowered to invest those assets have not yet put a £5 note into any of our securities or local authorities' securities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was also eloquent on this subject. On 25th March, 1952, in the Dáil&mdash;Volume 130, column 405, Official Report&mdash;he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They were lending the money at less than 1 per cent. Our Central Bank was lending money at 1.1 per cent. to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the war, while these banks were lending money at less than 1 per cent. to Great Britain, our <Col N="755" /> local authorities were being charged 4 per cent. for moneys which were being utilised to cut the emergency turf supplies for our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton was not to be outdone in this campaign. He went down to Baltinglass and, as quoted in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 1st June, 1953, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government and the bank &mdash;that is the Central Bank&mdash; believed that the nation's salvation lay in continuing to invest their money in Britain, while much of it was lent to the British Government at 1½ per cent., although Irish farmers, industrialists, shopkeepers and house-purchasers had to pay 6 per cent. for money borrowed here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these gentlemen were very eloquent a couple of years after they left Government on allowing the Central Bank to invest money in Britain at ½ or ¾ per cent., or whatever it was. They changed the percentage the Central Bank was getting from time to time. I put them a question here on several occasions as to why, if these investments of the Central Bank were &ldquo;wastepaper&rdquo;&mdash;as Deputy McGilligan used to denounce them as before he became Minister for Finance&mdash;why they allowed the Central Bank to invest, between 31st March, 1948, and 31st March, 1951, an extra £36,000,000 in this wastepaper for which the Central Bank was getting only a fraction of 1 per cent. of interest. Not one single one of them ever faced that question and explained to the people why they did it.</P>
    <P>On 31st March, 1948, immediately after the previous Government came in, the Central Bank sterling assets stood at £44.1 million, and on 31st March, 1951, they stood at £80.1 million, an increase of £36,000,000. Although I asked them several times in the House to explain to the country, when they were denouncing Fianna Fáil for allowing the Central Bank to continue to hold its sterling assets, why they allowed the Central Bank to increase its sterling assets, they were all mute on the subject. My belief is that the principal members of the Opposition and, indeed, a lot of other people who <Col N="756" /> are supposed to be responsible commentators on public policy in the country do not know the real nature and the function of the Central Bank's assets.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further, I want to put this matter in its proper perspective. There are other countries that have Central Bank assets. I am translating a table which is in rupees and pounds and dollars into dollars for the purposes of easy comparison. I want to read this table to Deputies. At the last moment for which we can get figures for the Central Banks or the Exchange Equalisation Fund or equivalent institutions in other countries, they held the following list of gold and foreign assets, giving the sums in terms of dollars.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies want the <Col N="758" /> matter obscured and to create a fuss and put me off my stride I will take as long as it is necessary to get this matter accurately on record. It was not just for the sake of collecting waste paper that the last Government increased the sterling assets of the Central Bank by £36,000,000. I am perfectly prepared to admit that, and neither was it to give cheap money to the British. It is because external assets have a certain nature and a certain function, and that is what I want to explain.</P>
      <P>Other countries have various institutions for keeping their external assets. Some of them have central banks, some of them have exchange equalisation funds or equivalent funds, but as long as they are external assets some institution or individual must hold them. For instance, if I have £100 invested in England and I want to take it back to buy something here, invest in Ireland, buy shares or whatever you will, I sell the £100 worth of stock in the London markets and the cheque is cleared through my bank here and the first result is that I am minus £100 worth of sterling assets but my bank has increased by £100. If I wanted to liquidate, on behalf of the nation, £100, the way to liquidate it is to spend it by giving it to some English person or institution for goods or services. Suppose we go through the exercises for the sake of clarity as to what would happen if the Central Bank were to realise the £71,000,000 or thereabouts of sterling assets that it holds at the moment and with the proceeds, and after going through all the rounds which I have described, bought £71,000,000 worth of Irish Government securities; the result of it would be that the sterling assets that are now held by the Central Bank would be transferred to the commercial banks. The Central Bank would hold, after that transaction was concluded: £71,000,000 less of sterling assets, £71,000,000 more of Irish Government assets, and the commercial banks would hold £71,000,000 more of sterling assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We take it the other way. Supposing that by law we compel the commercial <Col N="759" /> banks to reduce their sterling holdings, by say, £100,000,000 the result of it would be to increase the sterling assets of the Central Bank or some other institution by £100,000,000. Now do the Deputies&mdash;and here is a question I want to put to them to answer in this debate&mdash;seriously suggest that we should pass a law compelling the Central Bank to hand over its sterling assets to the commercial banks?</P>
    <P>I do not think that that would be a good idea. The commercial banks may be as reasonable as a lot of people think they are, but I certainly would not like to trust them to the extent of putting the power in their hands of holding all those external assets, liquid external assets of this country; and I think it is a good thing that whether it is regarded as a backing for the note issue or as portion of the national reserve of external assets that the Central Bank in fact does hold £71,000,000 worth.</P>
    <P>Other countries have proceeded differently from the manner Deputies suggest, namely, that the Central Bank should get rid of all these assets and invest in Irish securities. Other countries have prohibited the commercial banks from holding external assets of any kind. Even the American commercial banks do not hold gold or any more foreign notes than are necessary for their day-to-day business. All the American gold and the American foreign external assets are held by the Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Barney Baruch anything to do with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No. They would not let Mr. Baruch hold them. They insist that the ordinary commercial banks should transfer their gold to the Central Bank. But if Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton or Deputy McGilligan or Deputy MacBride or Deputy Mulcahy were in America, and if they carried on the same sort of argument that they used around the country here they would insist that the American people should take this money from the Central Bank and give it all to Mr. Baruch and commercial bankers like him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> Quite recently the Australian Government passed a law in which they compelled all their commercial banks to hand over all their sterling assets to the Central Bank of Australia. The same thing obtained in Canada, where all the sterling external assets of the Canadian Bank are held not by the Central Bank but by a special Exchange Equalisation Fund which they have established. In England the commercial banks are not allowed to hold external assets. They are all held either by the Bank of England or by the Exchange Equalisation Fund. These countries set aside the external assets they hold, but they hold quite an amount of money&mdash;as much as they can get hold of&mdash;in liquid securities in New York. In respect of the last quotation I saw for short-term securities in New York the yield was 1? per cent. It is not to give cheap money to Uncle Sam or to the Americans that the British, the Swiss, the South Africans or the Belgians hold liquid dollar assets which are equivalent to our sterling assets. Over the last year or so these countries have not earned anything like the interest that our Central Bank is earning. Perhaps it is because it has so little of its reserves in the form of gold and most either in the form of sterling or dollar assets that it earned 2.1 per cent. on its money. The Canadian Central Bank earned only ½ per cent. Australia earned .8 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputies will not get away with it on this occasion. I open this debate with a challenge to them to deny, if they can, the true function and nature of the external assets held by the Central Bank. If we can get agreement upon that matter we might, perhaps, discuss the financial affairs of this country in a more intelligent way, and in a way that would draw the respect of foreigners who know something about this matter. The reason largely given for demanding that the Central Bank should get rid of its assets and effectively give them over to the commercial banks is because we want cheap money. There is no inherent conflict between the Central Bank investing its holdings in sterling assets either at a big rate of interest or a small rate of interest, and having cheap money here. We can have as cheap money as any other country in the world and still, if our balance of payments is correct, hold portion of <Col N="762" /> our sterling assets in the Central Bank as portion of our national reserve and as a backing for our currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not always 1 per cent. above the British?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I warned the Deputy that he was not going to put me off, as he usually tries to do by asking questions that are not to the point. If our desire was to get cheap money or money for nothing for State purposes we could have a fiduciary issue as has been done in other countries to a limited extent. The British have altered the backing of their currency, as the Deputy knows. They have a certain amount of gold but they have fiduciary issues and they issue hundreds of millions of pounds from time to time. That is one way we could do it. There is another way also. Instead of having a fiduciary issue by the Central Bank we could arrange that the Central Bank would buy either short-term or long-term Government loans. That is being done in other countries. We could do it here if it was thought wise.</P>
      <P>What I want Deputies to discuss is the wisdom or otherwise, the limitations either upwards or downwards of that policy. We could as they do in other countries also, get the commercial banks either to invest in the longer-term Government stock or in short-term bills. In that way we could increase the volume of money. I do not want to go very much into the situation in other countries, but it is interesting to know that the holding of the French Central Bank of $573,000,000 worth of gold and external assets is a mere 8.3 per cent. of the total holdings of that bank. Other countries which can more readily meet their day-to-day bills coming in from abroad, such as Australia, hold 47.2 per cent. of their Central Bank assets in gold or other external assets. India holds 52 per cent. Switzerland has 96 per cent. of their assets, either in the form of gold or external assets in New York, London or elsewhere. The Netherlands hold 70 per cent. in that way, and New Zealand holds 54.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the conclusion I want to <Col N="763" /> point to at this stage. If it is cheap money Deputies want it can be got without touching the external assets in the hands of the Central Bank. It can be got in one of the ways I have suggested. But what are the limitations to the procurement of cheap money? There are some people who think the best way to run a country is to have no taxation and simply, by one or other of the methods I have outlined, to supply the Government with funds. It avoids the political unpopularity of taxation.</P>
    <P>Notionally a Government with powers to procure money from the sources I have mentioned for its ordinary purposes need never tax. However, that has its limitations and creates its difficulties. It is, in fact, the worst form of taxation. When a Government imposes taxation in order to meet its ordinary day-to-day needs it places the burden upon the smoker, upon the person liable to income-tax, upon people whose backs are fit to bear the burden. Ordinary taxation is selective taxation, selecting the people who the Government thinks should contribute to the support of the State and its outgoings. Purely inflationary creation of money to avoid taxation is, as I have said, the worst form of taxation because it takes a chip of everybody's pound or shilling whether he is a poor man or a rich man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, I see, has come in here with a lot of papers in order to reply. I want him to answer a direct question. If he thought external assets were waste <Col N="764" /> paper, if he thought it was criminal on the part of this Government to allow the Central Bank to lend money in England at 1 per cent. and charge 5 per cent. for money, why did he allow the Central Bank to increase those external assets by £36,000,000 when he was Minister for Finance? If Deputy McGilligan is not fit to answer perhaps Deputy Rooney would. A mere increasing of the volume of money to avoid taxation reduces the value of every person's shilling and pound whether he be rich or poor. It increases also the value in terms of our currency of the property of people who have a stake in the country. The value of their property would go up in terms of the Irish pound if we adopted the system of abolishing ordinary taxation and created money in order to meet the Government's day-to-day outgoings.</P>
      <P>There are people in other countries who think that is the only way to govern. If a French Government cannot get approval to impose a tax bill for various charges they go to the Central Bank for the money. The result is that only 8.3 per cent. of the holdings of their Central Bank is in the form of gold or sterling assets. The rest is in the form of Government Bills. If we wanted to do it we could leave the Central Bank with the £71,000,000 of external assets in its portfolio and compel it to take £100,000,000 of Irish Government bills and we need have no taxation next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan may not know much about finance but he has plenty of impudence. If there is anybody making a point or saying something he does not like he will always interrupt. The limitation to the creation of money is recognised by sensible Governments in other countries and that is why even though they have the power to create money they limit themselves. That is done where there is a responsible Government run by people who are trying to serve the long-term interests of the country rather than their own immediate political ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> A few years ago you had the situation in England under a Labour Government in which with set purpose they went out to over-balance their Budget, to produce a surplus, because the great increase of the volume of money that had occurred in England after the war through the deficits in the British budget had created a situation in which their external assets were disappearing, and the time was approaching when they would have nothing left with which to buy their food. They would have had to go to somebody for the loan of dollars to buy it. Even though the British people were very strictly rationed to a small sliver of meat per week and an egg a month, the Labour Government took steps to have a surplus in their Budget in order to bring their external payments into balance. It is normally considered by reasonable people and wise economists that a surplus or deficit in the balance of payments is an indicator or a barometer as to the financial policy that should be followed by the Government and by the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>When countries have a surplus in their balance of payments, or a near-balance, they can quite properly set themselves to follow an expansionist economy. It is proper then for the Government to borrow from the ordinary people or to borrow from banks in order to see that the economy does expand. But when you have a large deficit in the balance of payments, wise Governments try to meet all of their capital investment, or as much of it as possible, out of the current revenue, out of the current savings of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into any budgetary statement at the present time or to deal with our particular situation. What I have tried to do is to show the nature and the function of the external assets and to challenge anybody in this House who wants to contest the arguments I have put forward or the statements I have made, to contest them here and now. This has not been sprung upon anybody. I have asked them time after time and I am getting an opportunity now of doing it at the beginning of this debate, so that no one can say that he had not time to answer, if they can be answered.</P>

      <P>Many years ago, when I was younger, I was very fond of books by the Canadian humorist, Stephen Leacock, and enjoyed the jokes he used to make. My admiration for that author has gone up by enormous bounds this evening. He wrote a commentary upon the British people at one time and there was a picture which illustrated one of his books, describing a person as &ldquo;operating like an English Peer who was thinking hard but not lucidly&rdquo;. The picture that showed that man thinking hard but not lucidly is one which can very well be got from this afternoon's debate by anyone with a facile pen or pencil and who could see the deputy Minister for Finance wrestling with himself trying to disprove things no one ever stated.</P>
      <P>I have often argued that the assets of the Central Bank should not be held as they are and I will argue that again. I have also stated the position we found in 1949, when the commercial banks, which had their investment portfolios stuffed with foreign securities to the extent of £140,000,000 or £150,000,000 sterling, had only about £14,000,000 in home investments, Government or otherwise. That is a situation I have always deplored and I always thought we should change it. I had intended to change it; but I was in the happy position when I was Minister for Finance that there was no shortage of money. I had money&mdash;and money to spare. There was no plan we had for the development of this country that depended upon the provision of money and for which we failed to get proper assistance. We could get money in a variety of ways.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Statist</i> has recently published a supplement, in which I want to turn to an article on: &ldquo;Irish Banks and Irish General Credit Facilities&rdquo;, which is written by Mr. J.P. Colbert, who certainly at one time was regarded by the present Government as the champion of their point of view on these matters. On page 92, in paragraph (7), these phrases occur:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is suggested that the constitution and practice of the Central Bank of Ireland is sorely in need of reform. Its balance sheets show that <Col N="767" /> the assets acquired through the issue of legal tender notes, of which it has a monopoly in the Republic, are represented by £2,646,033 in gold and the whole of the other assets by investments in securities and sterling cash or bank balances outside the State. The July <i>Quarterly Statistical Bulletin</i> shows notes outstanding of £63.6 million, against which the Bank held British Government securities of £60.2 million and other assets (gold and sterling) of £3.4 million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the amount of the legal tender note issue out, having put back very much the same&mdash;the sum difference in the issue. Here is Mr. Colbert's summing up of the position:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nowhere in the world is there a parallel for such a position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy-Minister want any reply other than that&mdash;&ldquo;Nowhere in the world is there a parallel for such a position&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know where my money will be in that kind of contest. Mr. Colbert continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is not to make a reflection on the board of the Central Bank, but on the &lsquo;Red Tape&rsquo; legislation under which it was constituted. An informed glance at any weekly Bank of England return will show that practically all its assets other than gold consist of domestic securities and short bills and advances. The same holds true for the United States of America Federal Reserve Banks and, indeed, for practically every other foreign Central Bank. There is no theoretical reason why the Irish Central Bank should not, similarly, be free to invest its funds in Irish Government and other securities at the discretion of its board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Then he goes on to say why the Central Bank could engage in rediscounting as in the case of Central Banks in other countries.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colbert holds up the position as &ldquo;a picture without parallel in the world.&rdquo; I was advised along the same lines in 1949 when I first began seriously to consider the situation with regard to the investments of the commercial banks. In the autumn of that year I was told by those who were not merely entitled to advise me in the matter but who were experts and who had a right to advise, that there was no parallel in the world of banking for the practice of the Irish commercial banks in having virtually the whole of their securities portfolioed in foreign investments. Figures given to me in those days were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position at the moment is that, of a total security holding of £183,000,000, only £14,000,000 is invested in Irish securities, of which less than £9,000,000 are Government issues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the contrast was made for me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This should be contrasted with the position in Britain, where the London clearing banks against deposits mostly on current accounts of £6,000,000,000 hold investments of £1,517,000,000, virtually all Government stocks, in addition to Treasury deposit receipts of £44,000,000 and bills of £1,162,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position I found, and such were the representations made to me, which I accepted, because I thought they were sound, that the position of the commercial banks in 1949 was &ldquo;without parallel in the world.&rdquo; Mr. Colbert reports that with regard to the Central Bank at this moment.</P>

      <P>I am meeting the point that the position with regard to the Central Bank is, according to one economist and financier, &ldquo;without parallel&rdquo;. The same phrase was used with regard to the commercial banks in 1949 by people who advised me. At that time, in 1949, those who advised me also commented on the position of the Central Bank. After certain figures were given which showed the increase in the note issue and in the securities held against that note issue, the advice I got was contained in this phrase:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is clear that by far the greater part of the notes outstanding will never be presented for redemption into sterling...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was pointed out to me that the legislation of this State, more particularly the Currency (Amendment) Act, 1930, laid down a procedure allowing assets other than sterling to be held as cover for the legal tender note issue. The comment was that that was a facility that had never been used by the Central Bank. The position, therefore, is that Mr. Colbert openly, before the public, indicates his view with regard to the position of the Central Bank. The Department of Finance advisers had the same point of view, not merely with regard to the Central Bank, but with regard to the commercial banks in 1949. I am sorry that that wizard in finance, Deputy Davern, is not here now, because I should like to test his teeth on this. Mr. Colbert continues at paragraph 8 of this article which appears on page 92 of <i>The Statist,</i> of the 24th October, 1953:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The now totally unnecessary legislative provision to the effect that Irish legal tender notes are made payable on demand in sterling legal tender should be repealed. When originally established by the Currency Act of 1927, it had the definite practical meaning that a holder of Irish currency notes could use them to buy, as a statutory right, gold bars from the Bank of England at a price equivalent to £3 17s. 10½d. per oz. eleven-twelfths fine. Since the forced abandonment of the gold standard by Britain in September, 1931...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he points out what happened&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>Mr. Colbert continues&mdash;and this is the test I should have liked to put before Deputy Davern. When he comes to understand this, he will be able to understand the fallacies of the Deputy-Minister's reasoning. Mr. Colbert continues as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In other words, there exists the absurdity that an Irish paper money which is an unlimited legal tender for payment of all internal debts is made redeemable by conversion into an irredeemable external paper money over the issue of which there is no Irish control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I am asked what is wrong with the Central Bank, I say that it is mainly the legislation that was passed at the time of its establishment&mdash;legislation against which the people who now surround me on this side of the House fought during its passage through this House. We tried to get some amendments inserted. We tried to get some life into the Central Bank. We tried to get amendments put into the Central Bank Act which would correspond with the Currency Act&mdash;particularly the Amending Act of 1930&mdash;and which would give power to the Central Bank to invest moneys in home securities. I put it to those who were controlling the Central Bank in 1949 or early in 1950 that if they did not like to take the responsibility of investing some part of their assets in Irish securities I would take their responsibility from them: I would go to Dáil Éireann with amending legislation saying that the Central Bank, on the demand of the Minister for Finance, and after certain procedure, would have to invest some proportion of its holding in Irish securities.</P>

It is bad enough to have to impress facts on the unreceptive mind opposite but it would be impossible if I have to argue with the Minister in the course of an attempt to expose what he has been at. I offered to take the responsibility, if that was thought to be a good suggestion. If the Central Bank did not want to take the responsibility for investing in home securities I said that I would take responsibility to get the Act changed to enable a Minister for Finance here, openly and publicly before this House and, through this House, the people of the country to make the case that some proportion of the bank's holdings ought to be held at home and that we would even discuss in this House in what sort of home securities the moneys would be invested. That offer was not accepted. The bank has gone on. The Minister wants to know why the bank is compelled to do this, that and the other. It cannot be compelled unless the law is changed. It was set up as an institution by the Minister's group. Until the legislation is changed, it is futile to ask any Deputy: &ldquo;Why did you not insist on the bank's doing this, that or the other?&rdquo; I proposed to change it and I would have done it in due course.</P>

      <P>We came last night to apparently a new policy with regard to development in this country. Another Deputy Minister for Finance went to the bankers' annual dinner last night, the Minister for Lands. Apparently he has the feeling that the banks may change their investment portfolios. He thinks it is right that the Government should expect, as time goes on, the enlargement of the banks' portfolios, so far as investment in Irish Government securities is concerned. He expects that to happen. I should like to stress that the Minister for Lands spoke at the bankers' annual dinner last night&mdash;in other words, the 23rd November, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands who deputised for the Minister for Finance at this dinner last night said that the Government must get more money and the Government, apparently, having failed to get money, or having failed to get money from the community on their appeal through loan, are now going to demand more money from the banks. Why? Because, according to the Minister for Lands, deputising for the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;the alternative <Col N="774" /> to a reasonable extension of credit facilities to the Government, particularly for increased national productivity purposes, would be to cut down the State capital programme which would not be nationally acceptable, for these works were desirable and indeed essential not only as a means of developing the neglected resources of the country but also as a means, on the one hand, of sustaining employment, and, on the other, of absorbing savings which would otherwise in all probability be diverted abroad.&rdquo; That was the Minister for Lands in a white waistcoat&mdash;he should have been in a white sheet. That is a complete recantation of all that he and the Minister who now faces me have been saying over the years.</P>

      <P>Was it only yesterday that the resources of the country were found to be neglected? Fianna Fáil became the Government of this country in 1932. Were the resources of the country fully developed then? They lasted until 1948. In between, did they do much to develop the neglected resources of this country? They have come back since 1951. What is their programme since then for the development of the neglected resources of the country? That a Minister of a Government which became such in 1932 should go to a dinner in 1953 and talk about the necessity for the banks lending money in order to develop the neglected resources of the country requires a brazenness, or else, a stupidity that is beyond any sort of explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to some trouble here recently to find out what had the Government that held sway <Col N="775" /> from 1932 done in the way of capital development. I take it that the speech last night means that capital development is again in danger, that our capital development schemes and projects are definitely in danger. There is apparent acceptance of the view that capital development is required, but that is joined up with this attitude that the banks are going to be forced to lend money. I want to know what is the money required for. I go back to find out what Fianna Fáil did from 1932 on and I take their &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; commitments in any of the years. I find that the permission they gave themselves for below the line spending was, in 1932-33, £1,124,000; in 1933-34, £980,000; in 1934-35, £1? millions; in 1935-36, £1,000,000; in 1936-37, £2,250,000; and in 1937-38, £2,200,000. It rose about 1939-40 to nearly £3,000,000 but lapsed again in 1940-41 to £2? millions. In 1941-42, it was down to £1,500,000 and it remained about £1,000,000 and under the £1,000,000 mark until 1945-46. In 1946-47, it reached the amazing total of £3,500,000.</P>
      <P>These are the provisions made for spending below the line, but the actual expenditure was never up to the amount of money allowed. I think that over the years it is clear that there was not an average expenditure on this below the line type of service of £750,000 a year, except in one year, and that was the year in which a loan was floated, the Anglo-Éire Agreement Loan, in order to pay £10,000,000 to Britain. If that is regarded as development or a securing of a loan for capital purposes, have it; but the &ldquo;under the line&rdquo; servicing, the &ldquo;under the line&rdquo; arranging, never meant that there was more than £1,500,000 provided, and certainly there was not anything more than £750,000 spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another way of testing this. What moneys did Fianna Fáil borrow over the period they were in office? They floated a loan in 1933 for £6,000,000. The public took up less than £2,500,000 of it. There was a conversion loan some time later which I do not count because that was simply getting old money which had been <Col N="776" /> loaned&mdash;reloaned. There was no new service going to be financed by it. I leave out also the financial agreement loan because that £10,000,000 went in its entirety to Britain. In 1939, there was a loan floated for £7,000,000, to which the public subscribed £4,000,000 and, in 1941, there was another loan of £8,000,000, to which the public subscribed £7.3 millions. Altogether, in their period from 1932 to 1947, the Fianna Fáil Government borrowed £21,000,000. They got from the public £13,000,000 of that and the banks and departmental funds had to take up the rest. That is £21,000,000 over 15 years, and that is what is called capital development on the Fianna Fáil policy and basis. That is what has left the Minister who went to the bankers' dinner last night in a position to say that the country's resources were still in the condition in which they could be called neglected and, therefore, more money is now required from the banks in order to speed up what, of course, should have been done over the 15 years from 1932 to 1947.</P>
    <P>After I had floated the first loan for which I was responsible, the £12,000,000 3 per cent. Exchequer Bonds, in 1948, I was told by my staff at the time that I was not to get light-headed about the amount of money I had to spend, because I had very little. I thought that meant that there was some debt of a couple of million pounds against the £12,000,000 I had borrowed and I asked if it was as bad as that. I was told it was and a good deal worse. I could not believe what was then represented to me and so little was I given to believe in the matter that I got the thing put in memorandum form to me. Here is the position I was left in in 1948, having succeeded in getting £12,000,000 from the public at 3 per cent., as shown by this memorandum. The memorandum ran in this form:</P>

    <P>The whole tot was £11,500,000, but that was not the worst because this followed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A further £804,500 of Ways and Means Advances has since been repaid, bringing the total repayment since the loan was issued to £10,854,500. The amount of Ways and Means Advances still outstanding is £900,000, due as to £700,000 to the Paymaster General and as to £200,000 to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, there followed this:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PURPOSES FOR WHICH REPAID TEMPORARY BORROWINGS WERE INCURRED.</P>
    <P>The proceeds (£8,000,000) of the National Security Loan issued in November, 1941,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the last one of the three I referred to, the loan to which the public subscribed £7.3 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;were exhausted in the course of the year 1942-43. In fact on the 31st March, 1943, Ways and Means borrowings attributable to the 1942-43 Budget deficit had already been incurred to the extent of £1,400,000. Subsequent net borrowings up to the 31st March, 1948, and the purposes for which they were incurred are shown in the appended tables.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a supplementary sheet showing the sources and the causes of borrowing and there follows this summary:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total proceeds of the Exchequer Bonds issue (£11,500,000 to date) have been applied to redeem temporary borrowings&mdash;£1,450,000 Exchequer Bills and £10,050,000 Ways and Means Advances. Although borrowings are not hypothecated to particular purposes, it may reasonably be said that of this £11,500,000, £11,012,000 is attributable to Budget <Col N="778" /> deficits incurred since the 30th November, 1942, when the National Security Loan was exhausted. Capital issues in the period 1st December, 1942, to 31st March, 1948, which amounted to £9,396,800 may be regarded as having been met as to £3,560,000 by net receipts from Savings Certificates and as to the balance by borrowings from the P.O.S.B. and repayments of previous capital issues. The position is summarised below.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a note from the chief official of the Department stating that there had been an earlier note sent into me and this was the significance of the note:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In other words, every penny we received so far (referring to the total above) from the new Loan has been used in paying off old debts. We have still to get £1,000,000 from outstanding instalments, also likely to be used in repaying old debts.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the journal of the <i>Statistical Society of Ireland,</i> volume 17, there is printed a paper read by Mr. Eason before that society which is described as, &ldquo;An analysis showing the objects of expenditure and sources of Revenue of Éire during the financial years, 1929-30, 1939-40, and 1945-46&rdquo;. There was a discussion on the paper and one of the points that emerged from the paper was that in the six emergency years, 1940 to 1946, there had been Budget deficits of £16,000,000.</P>
      <P>It is not, of course, proper to add the £10,000,000 to that, because the years overlapped, but if I take out the amount of the Budget deficit for the last of these years and add what was accepted as being shown by Mr. Eason's paper, I get in the years 1940 to 1947-48 a Budget deficit amounting to £16,000,000, plus £3,000,000 or £19,000,000 Budget deficit. That has nothing to do with capital development.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to the situation. Capital development <Col N="780" /> does not mean running Budget deficits. It means meeting ordinary outgoings from ordinary revenue, and over and above that there is the policy that we adopted on borrowing money&mdash;trying to get the savings of the people, trying to get money even from the banks and trying to use departmental funds for capital purposes. We inaugurated a programme of big scale capital development. So far as I was concerned, I was in Easy Street for money. I want to repeat that once more. I had the savings of the community given to me. I had departmental funds. I had the American money, and over the three years we were in office we did skim off some £16,000,000 of the money we had as profits on the sale of goods that came from America and we left behind £24,000,000 to our successors.</P>
      <P>We had a big programme of capital development. It was objected to, objected to fiercely. We were told that we were putting the country in pawn. The hoardings of this city were disgraced with all the comments that were made by Fianna Fáil propagandists. Splashed around the insignia of the pawnbrokers' trade, under the three golden globes, were statements that we were putting the country in pawn. I forget on how many platforms we asked the people who were opposing us what, if any, of our projects met with their disapproval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pointed out that we were putting money into house building, into school buildings, into the development of land, industrial development, harbours, ships, afforestation, electricity and turf. We asked which of these was not a proper objective in the line of national development. We asked, further, what was wrong with the programme, if the objectives were good, or did they object to the method we had adopted of getting money. There could not be any objection to the rate of interest. Early on, we borrowed at the rate of 3 per cent., raised for a later loan to 3½ per cent. There could not be any objection to the use we made of departmental funds. In fact, better use was made of them for the three years we had control than was ever made before or since. I do not <Col N="781" /> think there was any objection to our using American money. If the Minister knows what he is talking about in regard to the money going into the Central Bank and swelling external assets, does it not mean that we were not spending the American money fast enough? I am sure the talk was about how fast the money could be spent when they got their hands on the money which was left.</P>
    <P>What objection was there to the programme we had? In Budget speeches made since the present Minister for Finance has said that he did not entirely approve of the things that were classified as capital services but that he was not going to make any objection. He has come here with two or three Budgets since, and year by year he has accepted schemes to which we were applying this money, saying that they were proper to be carried on and he would carry them on as long as the people gave him their money. But he did something wrong. He went for a loan at a particular time and offered a higher rate of interest than had been offered for money in this country for many a year. Mr. Colbert commented upon that in paragraph 6, on page 92 of this article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further to the question of house purchase finance, there now exists an unfortunate situation brought about by the fact that the Government mistimed a National Loan issue, which was made last year (September) at one of the outstanding peak periods of the long-term interest rate for more than a century. The issue was for £20,000,000 in 5 per cent. Stock at par (with option to redeem in 1962). Many competent judges felt that an issue for such a large amount should have waited for the inevitable fall in the long-term interest rate, meanwhile raising essential immediate requirements by means of short-dated Exchequer Bills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the comment which is made: that there were a mistiming of the issue of the loan which the present Government went for, that the time they chose was one of the outstanding peak periods of the long-term interest <Col N="782" /> rate for more than a century and that competent judges felt that they should have waited for the inevitable fall in the long-term interest rate, meanwhile raising essential immediate requirements by short-term financing of the ordinary type. He finishes the paragraph by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The repercussions were farreaching, not the least serious being in the realm of borrowings by local authorities and consequently in house purchase finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what happened after we left office. When I faced this House in 1951 with a Budget I announced openly that we were going to have both a conversion loan in 1951 and another approach to the public by way of a national loan. Comments were made afterwards in this House which had as their object the making of excuses for the present Minister for Finance in not facing the public in 1951. We were told that we were quite injudicious and wrong in looking for a conversion loan and a national loan at the same time. All I can say in answer to that is that I met in connection with that matter bank representatives on two occasions and on both occasions the considered advice of the bank representatives to me was that it was a good thing, having got the conversion loan out of the way, to go for a national loan at not too far distant a date in months from the conversion loan.</P>
    <P>What happened? The conversion loan was a success. The people did convert their money although the interest rate was very much reduced from the various holdings that had to be converted, and that was claimed by the Minister for Finance in his next Budget to have been a success.</P>
    <P>Why did not the Minister go to the public in the Autumn of 1951 for the loan? The answer is now clear to us of course. He succumbed to the temptation that he had £24,000,000 of cash ready to his hand and he spent it and did not look to the public for anything in that year. Amongst the many expert performances in the way of destruction that Fianna Fáil have carried on, I regard that as one of the worst. If the Minister had not known <Col N="783" /> what the plan was for the use of that money he could be excused, but it had been explained to him on occasions in the two years before, what the plan was. I suggest it was a good plan and one which he should have followed, and that was to keep that money in reserve, that it could be filtered in £5,000,000 or £6,000,00 here and there as required, that it could be held as a good reserve against an occasion when the public did not respond as well as they might be expected when an appeal was made to them to put their savings in a national loan.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of getting rid of that money was that it put the Minister under the control of the banking institutions. As long as he had that reserve of £24,000,000, it was a very potent thing to have in the background. He could use it as an argument, and if the banks tried to twist up the interest rate, as apparently they did when it reached 5 per cent. two years ago, he could have responded by saying: &ldquo;I will take my chance with some lower rate and, even if the money does not come in, my projects will not fail because I still have this vast sum of money to draw on in whole or in part.&rdquo; In 1951, was the Minister for Finance intimidated by the banks and not able to make his appeal to the public for his savings? The result was, anyhow, that the next year he had to go for a loan that was double what ordinarily might be asked for and his reserves were gone and these reserves never can be remade.</P>
    <P>Now I fear the worst from what the Minister for Lands, Deputy Derrig, said last night to the banks. This is the opening shot, I suppose, in a new campaign of putting it to the banks that they must give the Government more money. I do not object to anybody saying to the banks that they must give the Government more money &mdash;that should have been stated long ago&mdash;but I want to find out what the money will be used for. We had capital projects that were often given scrutiny. They bore the jealous scrutiny of the people who have succeeded us, and they have not been able to cast any of them overboard. Despite their <Col N="784" /> disparaging comments that they are not wholly approved of they are still retained. What is now being added? The resources of the country, according to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Derrig, were neglected up to last year. What are the new projects which the present Government have to substitute for our ones that they disparaged or to add to the projects that we had? I know of only three. One is the Dublin Castle project, the second is the vast expenditure of money on a stretch of road near Naas, and the third is the ordinary old-time relief business of pouring money out hand over fist.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister, when replying, tell us what are the projects for which Fianna Fáil require the assistance of the banks? If they despair that, even at 4¾ or 5 per cent., citizens will not lend money, are they as Deputy Vivion de Valera said, frightened because the people are going to the well too often? I wonder did the senior Deputy de Valera recollect that phrase from his son when, on the eve of the last loan, he announced to an astonished public that there had to be a national loan every year, and went on to say that if we did not get freely some of the savings of the people in this way by means of a national loan there will have to be adopted other and less desirable methods of finance. Is this the other and less desirable method of finance that the Taoiseach forecasted when speaking, I think, at Deputy Derrig's coming of age party in his constituency? Is this the new and less desirable type of finance?</P>

      <P>Deputy S. Collins has given notice to raise on <Col N="785" /> the motion for the Adjournment the subject-matter of Question No. 71.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I gave notice to-day that I would raise this matter on the Adjournment, I did so because I think the practice has grown up too readily in this House of Ministers refusing to disclose information which I think should be available to this House. When I raised the issue of the nominations to Tulyar, and the manner in which they were allotted, I did so as a person who had in no way impeded the subvention-in-aid from this House to the National Stud for development. Since then, this whole transaction has been the subject of very considerable rumour. I am now forced into the situation of inquiring from the Minister&mdash;I am doing it in a deliberate way&mdash;as to what use is being made of this extremely valuable sire horse, and in what manner the nominations to him are being distributed.</P>
      <P>There are persistent and insistent rumours abroad that we were thoroughly codded and hoodwinked in the price that was paid for this horse, rumours which, apparently, are now finding their foundation in some extraordinary changes which have recently taken place in the management of certain studs in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for the purpose of allaying public suspicion that I come into the House to ask the Minister to indicate to the House, and through it the country, how this particular semi-State body is functioning. There can be only one inference to be drawn from the Minister's present attitude, and that is that there is something to hide. I would hate to think that that was the situation. I think it is not only callous, but that it is treating this House with contempt, when a Minister will disown responsibility on the basis that he tried to disown it to-day, especially in view of the fact that this House was asked for an unprecedented Vote-in-Aid for the development of this stud. Though the Minister may say to me, and say correctly, that it was not a vote in a direct way for the purchase of this horse, we know that the capital <Col N="786" /> development of the stud, immediately after this grant of money was made, was the completion of the purchase of this horse called Tulyar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, on the question of nominations to Tulyar, I think that the background of his acquisition by the National Stud is relevant to the general situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. That matter was discussed, voted on, and a decision taken on it by the House. The matter may not be reopened now. The only matter that may now be discussed is how the nominations were allotted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having acquired this valuable animal, it then became the duty of the National Stud to use this horse to the greatest possible advantage of Irish racehorse breeding. The question that I have directed to the Minister only asks him to indicate in what manner the nominations were made, whether by ballot or otherwise, and how particular allocations of the services of this stallion were allotted.</P>
      <P>There is a fairly substantial rumour amongst the breeding trade of this country that there has been considerable preferential treatment given, not only to very wealthy breeders at home, but to very wealthy breeders abroad in the allotment of these nominations.</P>
      <P>That may not be so, and I hope it is not so; but I think it is the bounden duty of any Minister holding the portfolio which the Minister for Agriculture does, having come to this House for a tremendous subvention-in-aid for the development of this stud, to tell us how that money which was used to complete the purchase of this sire horse is being used by way of nominations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of interest to the people generally throughout the country to know on what basis one can get a nomination for what may be one of the greatest sires of all time, as we all hope he will be. We want to know what chance has the little man with a very good-class <Col N="787" /> mare of getting inside the present cartel. We want to know what hope these people can have of getting a percentage of the nominations that are available to this animal. The general objects of the National Stud suggest that the services of this animal should be directed to the general improvement of the horse-breeding industry of the country, and I would emphasise, of the farmer-breeder who has a good-class mare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the object and aim of the National Stud purports to be, and of the fact that this House gave an unprecedented sum of money for the development of this stud, and the fact that the money was used, in the main, for the purchase of this horse, I submit it is only reasonable that this House should thereupon demand that we get some reasonable information from the Minister as to what is the nature of the use of this horse generally in relation to our horse-breeding industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that there is a tremendous closed ring in connection with the type of mare that is going to be nominated to this animal, that it is being limited, not to the modest man with a good animal, but apparently to the very wealthy type of breeder who may have a selection of animals. The Minister knows as well as I do that any mare nominated to this stallion during the next couple of years, before his stock are tried, is being given a tremendous earning potential, and that until such time as the stock are tried and proven, there will be tremendous speculative buying of all the progeny of this sire. I think it will be odious, having something of <Col N="788" /> a distinct smell, if nominations to this animal are going to be kept within a cartel for that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows full well that, if this sire does not turn out too well, then nominations might be infinitely easier in years to come. It is terribly unfair in a project which is of general national concern that the Minister should withhold from us the system and the method under which nominations to this animal will be granted. I do not think it is fair of the Minister to wash his hands of responsibility on the basis that he tried to do it to-day. Whether the Minister likes it or not the people of Ireland generally regard this wonder horse as the property of the Irish people for the general betterment of Irish breeding and not for the enhancement of the studs of some of the wealthiest people in the world, and not indeed for the closed ring of a wealthy limited set within the country itself.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister whether any effort is going to be made to use this sire to the benefit of the modest man, the moderate-sized farmer who may have a first-class mare. What opportunity is he going to get to compete for these nominations? What percentage of the nominations to this horse are going to be reserved for that type? The rumour at present current in this country is that type of breeder has not got a chance of a nomination. If that is so I would like the Minister to tell us so. If not, I would like the Minister to tell us here and now how it is done so that he can dispose of these rumours and stop rising disquietude in relation to this horse throughout the State.</P>
    <P>We know perfectly well that certain changes are being effected within the National Stud. We know that there is proposed immediately a change of management but I want to know from the Minister whether he has adhered to the undertakings he gave us in the course of the debate&mdash;protracted as it was&mdash;on the acquisition of this animal that he would be made available within the framework of the general objects of this stud to the type of small farmer-breeder who has a valuable type of mare suitable for that nomination.</P>

      <P>I do not think I will delay the House very long replying to this question because, as I pointed out to-day, the Minister for Agriculture has no function in the administration of the National Stud. The National Stud is a company set up for the purpose of improving the standard of bloodstock here. One of the ways in which the bloodstock industry could be improved was the introduction of good stallions. There are a number of stallions, as you know, in the National Stud, Preciptic, Black Rock and Tulyar and the others. There has been no mention of them.

      <P>The question put down to me to-day was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate how nominations to Tulyar were allotted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I said that that was a matter for the Board of Directors of the Irish National Stud Company which it is. Actually the Minister has no function whatsoever. It is a peculiar thing to tell Deputy Collins and the House that I do not even appoint the directors. The Minister for Finance appoints them after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture so that I have no right of direction so far as the National Stud is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could you not inquire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no right to inquire for that purpose. The only <Col N="790" /> purpose I have as far as the National Stud is concerned is to receive the report and balance sheet and place them on the Table of this House. That is my function. In the matter of the day to day affairs of the company these are controlled and directed by the directors appointed for the purpose.</P>
      <P>As far as nominations to Tulyar are concerned I understand that the same system has been adopted in connection with Tulyar as was adopted in the case of Royal Charger. That was 25 per cent. of the nominations went to selected mares. That is quite understandable, particularly where you have a horse such as Tulyar that you must get the best possible mares especially in the first, second, third and fourth years in order to build up his reputation and enhance his prospects for the future. If it is possible to get a classic winner or a couple of classic winners, that is going to build his reputation.</P>
      <P>In the case of the balance, the 75 per cent., these are balloted for. They go into a hat and in the case of Royal Charger there were 40 nominations per year so that you had ten of them selected and 30 went to the general public. There has been no restriction on the number of applicants. Anybody who is prepared or was prepared in the case of Royal Charger to pay £400 had the right of putting in an application for his services. The same thing applies so far as Tulyar is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a word of truth in that. I understand at the time that this question of the further extension of the company was being discussed that the Aga Khan made it a condition in the sale of Tulyar that he was to get four nominations, for which he was going to pay. Now, again, I could argue that there was no person better entitled to them from the point of view of having the best mares going to Tulyar. The position is that the Aga Khan is the owner of the best mares in the racing world and it would be good policy to give nominations to him for that one reason alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the manager has gone to manage the Aga Khan's stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy apparently knows everything about it. It is just like the allegation that was made here to-day by Deputy Sweetman that I gave a direction to buy Tulyar. That is untrue. I gave no such direction that the Directors of the National Stud should purchase Tulyar or any other horse. The only direction I gave at the time was that if they were buying a sire I was prepared to go to the Government and ask them to come to this House to give the National Stud increased capital. I did that and there my function ended. I have no function whatsoever in relation to the day-to-day affairs of the National Stud. They are under no obligation to tell me what their day-to-day affairs are and I am not responsible for anything that may be done down there. I cannot disclaim any responsibility because I have no responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position then that the Minister does not know <Col N="792" /> how the nominations to Tulyar are allocated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the system has been but I have not been asked for my advice as to what the system should have been and I have no right to give advice. The people who have been appointed to run the stud are appointed for that specific purpose. I take it it was obvious at the time the stud was established that it would be improper to have it under the direction of a Minister. I do not think anybody in this House would stand for that. I certainly would not stand for it and I would not undertake the task of carrying it out. This was taken away from control by this House and I hold it was perfectly right to do that. People who know their business, who understand racing and bloodstock breeding were put in charge. I cannot understand why Deputy Collins should address this question to me. If he, or any other Deputy, wants information about the stud why not apply to the management of the stud and get the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>One would get it, too!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the people responsible for the running of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>And they would give the information!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy asked for the information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the man who asked us for £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for £250,000 in order to increase the capital of the company and not for the purpose of buying a particular stallion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us a moment ago that he told the National Stud that he was prepared to go to the Government and ask for money in order to increase the capital because they wanted to buy a stallion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not for the purpose of buying a stallion. It was for the purpose of buying bloodstock, including a stallion, of extending the buildings and renovating the existing buildings. If the Deputy goes back <Col N="793" /> and looks up my statement he will find there were other things included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was just a coincidence then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no coincidence. It was part and parcel of a scheme put forward for the purchase of stallions and mares, the erection of additional stabling and the renovation of existing stabling. All these things were included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tulyar has been bought but no renovation has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case I made. It is bad politics to try to place the blame on me or try to attribute to me blame for something for which I am not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not imputing any blame. I am asking a simple question. I fought for the money to be provided and I made a case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had his criticism. I have replied to the Deputy, and I gave him the answer according to the information I have. I have no function in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have given to the Deputy is what I understand to be the principle adopted in relation to <Col N="794" /> the allocation of nominations for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I say to the Minister we have reason to believe that information is not accurate, will he inquire further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>He has no method of doing that. He cannot inquire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not believe this is the policy. I do not know but that the Deputy may be right. I do not know what the policy is. I have no function in the operations of the National Stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no right to do anything except give the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no right to ask them what their policy is. They are a limited company set up for a specific purpose and I have no function of direction, or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not ask the Minister to direct them. I am asking him to ask them a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has no right to direct I take it he has no right to inquire or receive information. The only function he has is to get the report and balance sheet of the company and place those on the Table of this House. That is the only right he has.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 25th November, 1953.</P>
